Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the opportunities to buy shares in the morning and calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought based on the available funds. Then, it iterates through the opportunities to sell shares in the evening and updates the funds based on the number of shares owned. The final output is the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening, which is calculated correctly by the program. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic is sound.
