Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop.***
