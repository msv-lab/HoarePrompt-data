Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is not greater than 0, the program terminates.***
