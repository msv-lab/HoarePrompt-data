Output State: 
- `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0.
- If the loop executes and `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop terminates.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `m` is 0), the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, and `shares` remain the same as the initial state.
- The value of `r` is printed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0.**
