According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `i` is less than `n + 1**.
