Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
