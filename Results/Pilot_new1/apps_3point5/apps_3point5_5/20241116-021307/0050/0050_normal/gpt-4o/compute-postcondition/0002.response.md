Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to integers using the `map` and `int` functions, then stored in list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input**
