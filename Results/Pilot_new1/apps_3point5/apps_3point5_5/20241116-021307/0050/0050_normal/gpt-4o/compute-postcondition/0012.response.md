Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` are calculated as specified. The total bourles is determined by multiplying the maximum shares with the maximum sell price and adding the remaining bourles. The program then prints the value of `total_bourles`.***
