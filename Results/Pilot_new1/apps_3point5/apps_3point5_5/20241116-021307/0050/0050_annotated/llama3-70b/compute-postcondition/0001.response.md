Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted into a list of integers assigned to variable `s`. Since no variables are mentioned in the initial state, the output state will be: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a list of integers**
