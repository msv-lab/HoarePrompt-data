Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is incremented by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
