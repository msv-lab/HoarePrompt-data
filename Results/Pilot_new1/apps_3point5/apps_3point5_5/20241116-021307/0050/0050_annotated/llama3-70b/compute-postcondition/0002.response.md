Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function takes an input and splits it into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then maps the `int` function to each element of the list, converting them into integers. Finally, the `list(...)` function converts the mapped elements into a list. Since the initial state does not provide the specific input values, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
