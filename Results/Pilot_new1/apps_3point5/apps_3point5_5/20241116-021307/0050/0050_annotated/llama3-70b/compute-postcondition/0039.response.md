Example Answer: 
The variable `shares` is assigned the value of 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is: `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2**
