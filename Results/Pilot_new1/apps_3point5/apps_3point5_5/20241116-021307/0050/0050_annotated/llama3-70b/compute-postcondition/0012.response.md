Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1. `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
