Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged**
