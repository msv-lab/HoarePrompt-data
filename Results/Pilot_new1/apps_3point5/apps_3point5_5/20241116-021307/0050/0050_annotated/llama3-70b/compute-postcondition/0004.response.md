Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. This means that the elements in the list `b` are rearranged in descending order. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `s` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order**
