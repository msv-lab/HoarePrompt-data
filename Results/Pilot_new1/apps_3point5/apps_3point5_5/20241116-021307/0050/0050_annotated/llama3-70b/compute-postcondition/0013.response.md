According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged**
