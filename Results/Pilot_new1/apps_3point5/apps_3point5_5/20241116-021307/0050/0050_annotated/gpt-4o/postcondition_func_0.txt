The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from the input, as well as two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum value in list `s` as `min_buy_price` and the maximum value in list `b` as `max_sell_price`. If the `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`, and then prints `total_bourles`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
