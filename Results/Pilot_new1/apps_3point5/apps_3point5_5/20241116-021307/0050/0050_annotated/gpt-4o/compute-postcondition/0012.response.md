Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`.***
