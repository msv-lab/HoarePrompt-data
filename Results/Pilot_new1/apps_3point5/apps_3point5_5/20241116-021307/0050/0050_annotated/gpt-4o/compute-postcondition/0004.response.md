Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`. The value of `b` is taken from the input, so the exact value cannot be determined. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`**
