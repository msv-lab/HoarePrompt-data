The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, and calculates the greatest common divisor of their initial values. It achieves this by iteratively updating the values of a and b until b becomes 0. If b is initially 0, the loop will not execute. The function returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b.
