Example Answer:
The `numerator` is updated by multiplying itself with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`, where `total_days` is 1, `i` is 2, and `MOD` is 1000003. Therefore, the new value of `numerator` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1, numerator has been updated to 1, denominator is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
