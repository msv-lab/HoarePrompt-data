Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers n and k as input, representing the number of days in a year and the number of people to be interviewed, respectively.
- The function `func_1` calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday by iterating through the range of k and calculating the numerator and denominator based on the given formulas.
- The code correctly handles the calculation of the numerator and denominator, finds the greatest common divisor (gcd), and returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3) as required.
- The code does not have any logical errors and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
