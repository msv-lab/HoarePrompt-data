Example Answer:
The `numerator` is divided by `gcd` using floor division and the result is assigned back to `numerator`. The variables `numerator` and `gcd` are affected by this operation, while `denominator` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of the loop calculation after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is calculated as described, `i` is updated accordingly, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of the loop calculation after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is calculated as described, `i` is updated accordingly, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`**
