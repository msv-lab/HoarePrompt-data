Output State: **If k is at least 1, then after the loop executes, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - i)` for each iteration, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `n` raised to the power of `k`, `i` is `k-1`. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains `total_days`, `i` is 0**
