Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. Since `denominator` was initially calculated based on some formula involving `i`, the new value of `denominator` will be updated accordingly. The value of `gcd` remains the same as it is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of the loop calculation after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated based on the integer division with `gcd`, `i` is updated accordingly, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and updated `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of the loop calculation after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated based on the integer division with `gcd`, `i` is updated accordingly, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and updated `denominator`**
