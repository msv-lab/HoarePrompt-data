Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n` and `i` is 2. The previous value of `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)` and then by `(total_days - 2)`. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)` and then by `(total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
