According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to the result of `(total_days - i) * numerator`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to the result of `(total_days - 1) * numerator`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
