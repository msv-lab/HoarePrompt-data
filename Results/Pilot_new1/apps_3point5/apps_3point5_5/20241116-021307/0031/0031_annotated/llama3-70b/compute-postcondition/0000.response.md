Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `total_days` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`**
