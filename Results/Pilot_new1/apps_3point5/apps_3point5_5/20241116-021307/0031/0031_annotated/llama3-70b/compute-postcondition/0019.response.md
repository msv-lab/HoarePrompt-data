Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the inputs `n` and `k`. After that, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, updates both values accordingly, and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10 ** 6 + 3).**
