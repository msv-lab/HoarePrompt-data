Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is unknown, but it is divided by `gcd`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is updated to the result of `numerator` divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`.
Output State: **`numerator` is updated to the result of `numerator` divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`**
