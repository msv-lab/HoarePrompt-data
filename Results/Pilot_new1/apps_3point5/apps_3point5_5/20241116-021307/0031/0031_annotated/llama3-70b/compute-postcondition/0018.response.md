The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of `n` divided by `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and return the remainder of `n` divided by `k`.
