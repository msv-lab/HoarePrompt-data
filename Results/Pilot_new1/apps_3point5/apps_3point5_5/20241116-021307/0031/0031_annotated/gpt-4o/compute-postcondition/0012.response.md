Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The value of `total_days` is a shifted left by `n`, `i` is 1, and `MOD` is 1000003. Therefore, the output state is: `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
