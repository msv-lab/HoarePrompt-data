Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the numerator and denominator values based on the total_days and updates them accordingly. The loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, MOD remains 1000003, total_days is shifted left by n, numerator and denominator are updated values. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and numerator and denominator remain 1.**
