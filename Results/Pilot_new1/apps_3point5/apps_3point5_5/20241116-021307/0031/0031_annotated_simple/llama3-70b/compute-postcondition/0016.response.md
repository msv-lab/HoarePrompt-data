Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The value of `numerator` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, `numerator` is updated after division, and `denominator` is updated after division.
Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, `numerator` is updated after division, `denominator` is updated after division**
