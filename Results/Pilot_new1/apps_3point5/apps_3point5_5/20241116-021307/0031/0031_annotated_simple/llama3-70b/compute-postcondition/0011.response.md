Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, where `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `denominator` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days - 2`), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
