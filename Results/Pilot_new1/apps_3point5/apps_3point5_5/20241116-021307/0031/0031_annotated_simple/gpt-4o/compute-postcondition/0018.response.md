Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` will be the product of all values from `1` to `total_days` shifted left by `n`, modulo `MOD`, and `denominator` will be the product of all values from `1` to `total_days`, modulo `MOD`. If k is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` will remain as `1`.**
