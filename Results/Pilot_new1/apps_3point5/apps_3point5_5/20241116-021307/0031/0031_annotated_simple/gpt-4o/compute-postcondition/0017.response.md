According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - 3) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to the result of `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
