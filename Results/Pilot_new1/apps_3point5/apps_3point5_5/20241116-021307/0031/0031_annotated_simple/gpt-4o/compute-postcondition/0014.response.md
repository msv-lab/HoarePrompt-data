According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to the result of `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2.
State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - 2) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to the result of `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
