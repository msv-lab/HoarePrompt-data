Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or unknown.
- It then compares these values according to the problem description.
- If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+', which means there are more upvotes than downvotes.
- If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-', which means there are more downvotes than upvotes.
- If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0', which means the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal. If `z` is not 0, it prints '?', indicating an uncertain result.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?' as the result is uncertain.

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the input values.
