Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`; the condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, and max_downvotes is not less than min_upvotes**
