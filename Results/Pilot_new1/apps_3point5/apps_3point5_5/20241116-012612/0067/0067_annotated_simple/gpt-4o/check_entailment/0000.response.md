Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values. Then, it checks if the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes and prints "-" if true. If not, it checks if the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes and prints "+" if true. Otherwise, it prints "?" to indicate uncertainty. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each scenario.
