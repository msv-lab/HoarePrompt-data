Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the user input, and based on their values, it prints one of the following: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, or '?' if x equals y and z is not 0, or x is not equal to y. The function covers all cases based on the comparison of x, y, and z.**
