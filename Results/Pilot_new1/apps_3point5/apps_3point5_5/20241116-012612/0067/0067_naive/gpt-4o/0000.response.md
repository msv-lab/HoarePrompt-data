Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- For the first example (3 7 0), the program correctly outputs "-" as there are more downvotes than upvotes.
- For the second example (2 0 1), the program correctly outputs "+" as there are more upvotes than downvotes, regardless of the unknown vote.
- For the third example (1 1 0), the program correctly outputs "0" as the upvotes and downvotes are equal.
- For the fourth example (0 0 1), the program correctly outputs "?" as there are two possible outcomes depending on the unknown vote.
