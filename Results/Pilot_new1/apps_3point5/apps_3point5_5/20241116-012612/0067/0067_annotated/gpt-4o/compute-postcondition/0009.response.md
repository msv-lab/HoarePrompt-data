Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false.**
