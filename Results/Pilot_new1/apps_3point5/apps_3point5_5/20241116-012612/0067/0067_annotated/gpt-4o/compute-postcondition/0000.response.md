Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100**
