Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, '-' is printed. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, '+' is printed. Otherwise, '?' is printed. All variables maintain their original non-negative integer values between 0 and 100, and their relationships remain consistent after the if else block executes, covering all edge cases.***
