Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`, where `y` and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. The previous values of `y` and `z` are known, so `max_downvotes` will be the sum of those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`**
