The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input. It then checks the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on certain conditions and prints different symbols ('+', '-', '0', or '?') accordingly. The conditions are as follows: if x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x is equal to y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
