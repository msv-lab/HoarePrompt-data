Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
