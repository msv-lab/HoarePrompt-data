Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using a sliding window approach to find if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It iterates through the colors of the Jedi Knights and checks if the current interval meets the desired color counts. The implementation handles the case where there is an interval with the prescribed color counts and returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
