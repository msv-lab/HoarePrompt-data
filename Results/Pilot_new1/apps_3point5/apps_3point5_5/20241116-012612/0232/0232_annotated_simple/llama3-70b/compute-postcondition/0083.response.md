Postcondition: ***If n is less than or equal to i, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates through the colors list, incrementing the count of each color in window_counts. If all counts in window_counts match the corresponding counts in counts, found is set to True. After the loop, j is equal to the final value of i plus the number of iterations, window_counts contains the counts of colors encountered, and found is True if all counts match the desired counts. found is True***
