Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, then `j` will be equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` will contain the count of each color encountered in the loop, `found` will be True if all counts match the desired counts, `color` will be the last color encountered, and the loop will break if all counts in `window_counts` match the counts in the list `counts`. If `found` is False, then `window_counts` will remain an empty dictionary, `found` will stay True if it was True initially, and `color` will not be assigned.***
