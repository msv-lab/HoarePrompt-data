Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input, so the output state is: n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. The sum of all elements in counts is less than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. The sum of all elements in counts is less than or equal to n**
