Postcondition: ***The counts in the sorted window_counts align with the counts in the counts list, leading to found being set to True and the loop terminating. If all counts in the sorted window_counts match the corresponding counts in the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, found remains unchanged, and the loop continues.***
