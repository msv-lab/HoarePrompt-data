Postcondition: ***If n is greater than i, j is equal to n - 1, window_counts contains the key color with a value of 1 more than its previous value, found is True, color is assigned the value of colors[j], and all counts in window_counts are equal to the corresponding target counts in counts, then the program breaks out of the loop. If color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1.***
