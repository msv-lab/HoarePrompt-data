Output State: **If all values in current_counts for the colors match the corresponding values in desired_counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, current_counts will have at least one color with a count less than the corresponding count in desired_counts. The loop will continue to decrement the count for colors and move the left pointer until the conditions are met.**
