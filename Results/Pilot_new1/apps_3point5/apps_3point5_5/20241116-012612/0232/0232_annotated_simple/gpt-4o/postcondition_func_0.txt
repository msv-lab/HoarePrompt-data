The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It initializes `desired_counts` as a dictionary mapping values from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`. It then iterates through the colors list, updating the counts in `current_counts` and checking if all counts match the desired counts. If they do, it returns 'YES'. If not, it continues to adjust counts until the conditions are met. If the loop does not execute due to `n` being 0 or `desired_counts` being empty, the function returns 'NO'.
