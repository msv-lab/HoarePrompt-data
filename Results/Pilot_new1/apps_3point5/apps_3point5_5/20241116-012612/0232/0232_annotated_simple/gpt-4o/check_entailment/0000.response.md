Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of colors and maintains a sliding window to check if the desired counts of each color can be achieved within that window. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval exists, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The program covers all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
