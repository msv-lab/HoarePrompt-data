Postcondition: ***desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0, left is 0, right is from 0 to n-1. If all values in current_counts for the colors match the corresponding values in desired_counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
