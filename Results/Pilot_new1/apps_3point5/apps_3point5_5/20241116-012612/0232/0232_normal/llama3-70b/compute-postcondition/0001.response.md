Example Answer:
The list `colors` is assigned the values input by the user after converting them to integers. The length of the list `colors` is `n`, and the values in the list are integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `counts` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `counts` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$**
