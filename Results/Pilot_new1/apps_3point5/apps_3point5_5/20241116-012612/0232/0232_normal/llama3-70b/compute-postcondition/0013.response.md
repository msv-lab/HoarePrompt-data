According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more colors in the list `colors` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color. To execute one more time, the loop needs to ensure that there is at least one more color left in the list `colors` to iterate through.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of colors left in the list `colors`. Since one color has been processed in the previous iteration, the number of colors left in the list should be decreased by 1.
State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color and one less color in the list to iterate through**
