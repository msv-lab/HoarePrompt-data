Postcondition: ***If `i+1` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts up to index `j+1`, `found` is True, and `color` is the color at index `j+1` in the list `colors`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts` before the execution of the if statement, it is now added with a count of 1; if `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its count is incremented by 1. Additionally, if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` remains True. After the execution of the if statement, the loop is broken.***
