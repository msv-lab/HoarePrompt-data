Postcondition: ***If `n` is 1 or greater and `found` is True, the loop is broken and the program state remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `i` is not defined. In all other cases, the program continues without any modifications to the initial state.***
