Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as empty. This dictionary will be used to store the count of each color present in the `colors` list. Since the dictionary is empty, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `counts` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$; `counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained from splitting the input; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
