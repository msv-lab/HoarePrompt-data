According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 and `found` is False. If `n` is less than or equal to 1 and `found` is True, the loop is broken. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the state is modified accordingly. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `found` must be False. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No modifications needed to the initial state**
