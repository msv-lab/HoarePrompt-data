Postcondition: ***`n` is 1 or greater, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` set to 1 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their respective targets, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the initial state.***
