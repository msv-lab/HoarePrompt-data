According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `colors` list has at least 1 color. To ensure the loop executes, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted such that `colors` list has at least 1 color, and `color` is the first color in the list. 
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$ obtained from splitting the input; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the first color in the `colors` list**
