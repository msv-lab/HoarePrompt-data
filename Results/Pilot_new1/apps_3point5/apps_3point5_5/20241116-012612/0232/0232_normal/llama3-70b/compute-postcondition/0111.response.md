Output State: **`i+1` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts up to index `j+1`, `found` is True, `color` is the color at index `j+1` in the list `colors`, and if `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` remains True. Additionally, after the execution of the if statement, if `color` was not present in `window_counts`, it is now added with a count of 1; if `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its count is incremented by 1.**
