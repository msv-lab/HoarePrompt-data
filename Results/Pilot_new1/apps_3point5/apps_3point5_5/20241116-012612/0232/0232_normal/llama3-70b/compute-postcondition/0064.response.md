Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` has a value of 1. `i` is equal to `j`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. All values in `window_counts` are sorted and match the corresponding values in `counts`. If this condition is met, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
