Postcondition: ***If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute. If the loop does execute, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each `color` key represents the count of that color in the `colors` list up to the current index `j`. The loop increments the count of each color encountered in the `colors` list. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `colors`, and `counts` remain unchanged after the loop execution.***
