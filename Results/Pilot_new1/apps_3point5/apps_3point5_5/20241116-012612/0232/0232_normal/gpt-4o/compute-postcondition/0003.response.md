According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `left` is 0 and `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `right` is 0.
State: **`left` is 0, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
