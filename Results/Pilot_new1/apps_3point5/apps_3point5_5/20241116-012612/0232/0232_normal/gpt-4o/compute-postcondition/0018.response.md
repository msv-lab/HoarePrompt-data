According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` has been updated, `left` has been incremented, `right` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0**
