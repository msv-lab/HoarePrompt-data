Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each color within the window of Jedi Knights being considered. If at any point the counts match the desired counts, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then outputs "YES" if a valid interval is found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic seems correct and covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
