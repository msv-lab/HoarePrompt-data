Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean that is True if all counts of colors in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets. `i` is an integer that remains 0. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `i`. `j` is an integer that remains equal to `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` keys and values of 1 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, and the counts match the target values for each color in `window_counts`. If the condition in the if part is satisfied, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
