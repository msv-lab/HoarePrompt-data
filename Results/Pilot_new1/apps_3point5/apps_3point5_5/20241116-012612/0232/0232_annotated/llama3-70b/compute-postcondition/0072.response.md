Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable indicating whether the target counts are found in `window_counts`. `i` is an integer with a value of 1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. `j` is equal to `i` + 1. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the color as a key and its count as a value, with the count of `color` incremented by 1 if `color` was already present in `window_counts`. `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and if `color` was not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and a break occurs. This encompasses all cases and edge scenarios where the target counts are successfully found in `window_counts`.***
