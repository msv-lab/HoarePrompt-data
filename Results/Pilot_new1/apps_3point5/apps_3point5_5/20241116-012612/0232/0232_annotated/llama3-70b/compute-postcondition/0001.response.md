Example Answer:
The list `colors` is assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The length of the list `colors` is `n`. The values of the list `colors` represent the colors of the lightsabers. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n**
