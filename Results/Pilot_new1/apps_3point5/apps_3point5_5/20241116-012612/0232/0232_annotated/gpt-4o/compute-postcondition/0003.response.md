According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is within the range of n. Before the loop starts, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The states that need to be adjusted are `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.
State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
