Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0 with at least one color having a desired count greater than the current count, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If all the current counts of colors match their desired counts, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
