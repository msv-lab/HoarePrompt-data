Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their desired counts equal to their current counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count, the loop will continue to execute, decrementing the count of the color at index `left` and incrementing `left` by 1. The values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain the same.**
