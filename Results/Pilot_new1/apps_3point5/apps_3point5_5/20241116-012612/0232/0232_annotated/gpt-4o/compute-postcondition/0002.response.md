Example Answer:
`left` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0**
