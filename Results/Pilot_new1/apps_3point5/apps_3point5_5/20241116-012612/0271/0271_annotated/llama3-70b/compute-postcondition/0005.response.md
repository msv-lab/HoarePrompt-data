Example Answer:
The code prints the result of `n - n % 10`, where `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. This operation effectively removes the units digit of `n` and prints the resulting number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer and n is not divisible by 10. 
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer and n is not divisible by 10**
