Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and not divisible by 10. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then the program prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is larger than 5, then the program prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10.***
