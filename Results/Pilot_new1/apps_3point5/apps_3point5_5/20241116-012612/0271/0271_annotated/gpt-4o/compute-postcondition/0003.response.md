Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 5. The output state will depend on the specific values of `n` and `remainder`, resulting in a new value for `result`.
Output State: **`result` is the result of `n - remainder` based on the specific values of `n` and `remainder`**
