The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, computes a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the difference between `n` and the remainder. If the remainder is greater than 5, the result is the sum of `n` and (10 - remainder). The function then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
