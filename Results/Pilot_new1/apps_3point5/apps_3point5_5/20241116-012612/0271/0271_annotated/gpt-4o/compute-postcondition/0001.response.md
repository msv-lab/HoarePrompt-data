Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the possible values of `remainder` can be from 0 to 9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9**
