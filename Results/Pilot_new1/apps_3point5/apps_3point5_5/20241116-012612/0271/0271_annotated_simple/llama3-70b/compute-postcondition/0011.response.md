Functionality: **The function func reads an integer input from the user, checks if the input is divisible by 10, and prints different values based on the remainder of the input divided by 10. If the input is divisible by 10, it prints the input value. If the input is not divisible by 10, it prints the input value rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 if the remainder is greater than 5. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
