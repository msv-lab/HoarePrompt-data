Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and not divisible by 10. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n minus the remainder of n divided by 10. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5, the program prints n plus 10 minus the remainder of n divided by 10. This covers all possible cases for the given program fragment.***
