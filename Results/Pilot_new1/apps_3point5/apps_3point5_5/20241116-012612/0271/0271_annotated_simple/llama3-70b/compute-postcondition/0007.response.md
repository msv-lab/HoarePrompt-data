Example Answer:
The value of `n` is added to the result of `(10 - n % 10)`. Since `n` is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, the expression `(10 - n % 10)` will result in a number greater than 5. Therefore, when adding this value to `n`, the result will always be a number ending in 0. The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, and the result is a number ending in 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, and the result is a number ending in 0**
