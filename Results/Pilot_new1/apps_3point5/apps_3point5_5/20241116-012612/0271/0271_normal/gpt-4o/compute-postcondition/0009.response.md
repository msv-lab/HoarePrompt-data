Functionality: **The function prompts the user for an integer input, calculates the remainder of that input when divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, adjusts the result accordingly. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the input minus the remainder; otherwise, the result is the input plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
