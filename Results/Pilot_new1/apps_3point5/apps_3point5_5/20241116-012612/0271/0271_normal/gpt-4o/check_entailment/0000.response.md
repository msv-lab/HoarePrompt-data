Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder of the input number when divided by 10 and then adjusts the result accordingly. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the input number. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input number. This logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. The code handles all scenarios where the input number can be rounded to the nearest integer ending with 0.
