Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, where `%` is the modulo operator that calculates the remainder of division. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9**
