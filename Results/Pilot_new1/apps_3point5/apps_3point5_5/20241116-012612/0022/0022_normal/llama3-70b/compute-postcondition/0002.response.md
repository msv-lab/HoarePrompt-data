Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. Since there are no changes in the initial state variables `s` and `n`, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True**
