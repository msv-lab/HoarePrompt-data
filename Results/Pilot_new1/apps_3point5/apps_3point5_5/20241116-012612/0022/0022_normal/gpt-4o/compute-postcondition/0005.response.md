According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
