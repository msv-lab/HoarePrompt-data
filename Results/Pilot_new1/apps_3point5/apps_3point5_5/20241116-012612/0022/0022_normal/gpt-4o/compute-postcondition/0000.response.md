Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; n is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; n is an integer between 1 and 1000**
