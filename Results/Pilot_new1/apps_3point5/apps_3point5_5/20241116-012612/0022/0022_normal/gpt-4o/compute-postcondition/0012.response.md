Output State: **If the string `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The loop checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string `s` are equal. If they are not, the function returns False. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2.**
