Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s` using the `len()` function. Since `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` will be an integer representing the length of the string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string**
