According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be increased by 1. Since the loop breaks if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` should be equal at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 2**
