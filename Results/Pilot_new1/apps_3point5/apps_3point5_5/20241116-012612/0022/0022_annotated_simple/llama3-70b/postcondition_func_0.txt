The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input, calculates its length `n`, and checks if `s` is a palindrome. It iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters from the beginning and end. If a mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if `s` is a palindrome, and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and operates only on strings of length between 1 and 1000 containing English letters.
