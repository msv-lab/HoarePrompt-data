According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, and `n` is the length of string `s`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
