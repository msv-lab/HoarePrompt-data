According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
