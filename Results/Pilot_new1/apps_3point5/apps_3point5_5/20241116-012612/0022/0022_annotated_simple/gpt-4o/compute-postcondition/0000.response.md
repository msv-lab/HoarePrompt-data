Example Answer: 
The length of string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function and stored in variable `n`. Since the length of the string `s` can vary between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 1000 based on the length of the input string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`**
