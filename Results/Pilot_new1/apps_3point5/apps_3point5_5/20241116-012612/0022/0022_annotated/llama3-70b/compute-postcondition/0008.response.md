According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
