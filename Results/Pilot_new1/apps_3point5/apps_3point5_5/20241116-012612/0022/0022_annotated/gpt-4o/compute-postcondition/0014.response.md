The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If the length of the string is at least 2, the loop checks if the characters at symmetric positions are equal. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns False. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True if all characters at symmetric positions are equal, otherwise it returns False.
