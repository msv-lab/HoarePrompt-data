The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It iterates over each character in `s` and concatenates characters that are also present in `t` to form a new string `n`. If `t` is not empty, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string. However, it misses handling the case where `t` is an empty string, which would result in the function always returning 0.
