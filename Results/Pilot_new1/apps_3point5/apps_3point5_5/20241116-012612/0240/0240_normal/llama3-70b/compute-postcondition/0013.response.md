Output State: **If `t` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain an empty string. If `t` is not empty, the loop will iterate over each character in `s` and if the character is in `t_set`, it will be concatenated to `n`. Therefore, `n` will be a string containing only the characters from `s` that are also in `t`.**
