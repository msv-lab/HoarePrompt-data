Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, resulting in a new value for `n`. The previous values of `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a new string formed by concatenating the previous value of `n` and `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a new string formed by concatenating the previous value of `n` and `c`**
