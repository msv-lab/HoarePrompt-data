Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the character `c`, so the value of `n` changes based on the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenated value of `c`. 
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenated value of `c`**
