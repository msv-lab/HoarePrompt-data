Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the character `c`. The previous value of `n` is a string. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`**
