The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a number, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of a number. It iterates over permutations of `chars`, creates a candidate string by joining the elements of each permutation, and yields the candidate if it passes the validation check by calling `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If `is_valid_number` returns true, the function yields the candidate. If either `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute. The function does not have a specific output defined in the constraints and relationships provided.
