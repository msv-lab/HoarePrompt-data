Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The previous values of `perm` and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`**
