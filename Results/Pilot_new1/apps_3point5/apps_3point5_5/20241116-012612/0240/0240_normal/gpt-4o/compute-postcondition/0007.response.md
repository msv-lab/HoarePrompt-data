Example Answer:
The code yields the value of `candidate` at that point in the loop. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. The loop will continue based on the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, and the next step in the loop will be determined by the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`.
Output State: **`chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, and the next step in the loop will be determined by the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`**
