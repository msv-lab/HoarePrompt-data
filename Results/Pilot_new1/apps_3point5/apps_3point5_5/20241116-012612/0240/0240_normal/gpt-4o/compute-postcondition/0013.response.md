According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars`, `sub`, `candidate`, and the result of the `is_valid_number` function. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, and `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` is true, then the loop will execute again. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `perm` variable should be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. Additionally, the `sub` variable should be updated to a different substring of the number, and the `candidate` variable should be updated by joining the new `perm`. The condition `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` should still hold true after these adjustments.

State: **`chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the new `perm`**
