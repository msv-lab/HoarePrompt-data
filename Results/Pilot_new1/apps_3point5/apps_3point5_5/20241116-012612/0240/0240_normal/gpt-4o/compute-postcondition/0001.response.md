Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the concatenated string returned by the `join` method applied to the variable `perm`. The value of `perm` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `candidate` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` has at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number, and `candidate` is the result of joining the elements of `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` has at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number, and `candidate` is the result of joining the elements of `perm`**
