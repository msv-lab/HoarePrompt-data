According to the code, the loop can execute if the string `chars` has at least 1 character. The `permutations` function will generate permutations of the characters in the string `chars`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `chars` must have at least 1 character. Before the loop starts, `sub` being a string representing a substring of a number does not affect the loop execution. Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to `chars` has at least 1 character.
State: **`chars` has at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number**
