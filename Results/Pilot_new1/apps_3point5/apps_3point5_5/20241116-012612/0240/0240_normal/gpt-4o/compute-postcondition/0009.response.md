According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` variable. If there are more permutations to generate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number. If the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` is true, then the program yields `candidate`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more permutations left to generate in `chars`. This means that the `chars` variable should still contain at least 1 character, and the `sub` should represent a different substring of the number. 

State: **`chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number**
