Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to `n`, but the previous value of `n` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` should be the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged, `n` may or may not be incremented based on the presence of `c` in `t_set`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` should be the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged, `n` may or may not be incremented based on the presence of `c` in `t_set`**
