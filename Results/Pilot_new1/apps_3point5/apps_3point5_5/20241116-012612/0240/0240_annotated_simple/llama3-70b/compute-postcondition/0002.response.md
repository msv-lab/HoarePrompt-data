According to the code, the loop will execute for each character `c` in string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in string `s`. 
Before the loop starts, the string `s` needs to have at least one character for the loop to execute. The set `t_set` containing the characters of string `t` does not affect the loop execution directly. The empty string `n` doesn't impact the loop execution. 
Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string**
