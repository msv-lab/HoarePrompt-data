According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters left to iterate in `s`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` should be the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is incremented by the value of `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `s` should still be a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate.
- `c` should be the next character in `s`.
- `t_set` remains unchanged.
- If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` should be incremented by the value of `c`. Otherwise, `n` should remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` is the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged, `n` is adjusted based on the value of `c` and whether it is in `t_set`.**
