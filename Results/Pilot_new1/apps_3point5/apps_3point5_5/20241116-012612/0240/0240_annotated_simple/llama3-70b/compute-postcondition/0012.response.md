According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the character `c`. If `c` is the next character in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` is the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` should still have at least one more character to iterate, and `c` should be the next character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate, `c` is the next character in `s`, `t_set` remains unchanged**
