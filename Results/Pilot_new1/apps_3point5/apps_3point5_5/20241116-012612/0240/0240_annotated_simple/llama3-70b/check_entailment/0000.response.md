Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes a string `s` and a substring `t` as input. It then iterates over the characters in `s` and appends only those characters that are present in `t` to the variable `n`. After that, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string.

The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that the substring `t` is appended to the right of the reconstructed number `n`. It handles the case where `n` contains leading zeroes by concatenating the characters from `s` that are present in `t`. The program also ensures that the answer always exists, as mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the requirements of the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
