The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub. It calculates the difference in character counts between s and sub, then generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters in s after subtracting the characters in sub. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. If sub is empty, the function does not execute the loop.
