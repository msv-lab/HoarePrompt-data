Example Answer: 
The `yield` statement returns the `candidate` string, which is obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. The state of the variables does not change, so the output state is: `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`**
