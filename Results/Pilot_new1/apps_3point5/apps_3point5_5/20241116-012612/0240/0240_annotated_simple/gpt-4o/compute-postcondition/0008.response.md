Postcondition: ***`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Ensure that `candidate` remains a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm` even if the condition is not met.***
