The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a number with no leading zeroes, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of `chars`. It iterates through all permutations of characters in `chars`, generates a candidate string by joining these permutations, and checks if the candidate is a valid number using the `is_valid_number` function with the `sub` parameter. If the candidate is valid, it yields the candidate string. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the given constraints.
