Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to only keep the characters that are present in `t`. After that, it concatenates `t` to the end of the filtered `s` to form the smallest possible integer `n`. The logic of the program seems correct and it follows the problem description accurately. It handles the case where the input data is correct and the answer always exists.
