According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters left in `s` to iterate over and whether the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` still has characters left to iterate over. If the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the value of `c`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` must be present in `t_set`.
State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate over, `c` is present in `t_set`, `n` is increased by the value of `c`**
