According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters left to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered. If the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, then it should be added to `n`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: `s` should still have characters left to iterate over, and if the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, it should be added to `n`.
State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate over, if the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, then add it to `n`.**
