According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. Before the loop starts, `s` should not be an empty string for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `t_set` contains unique characters in `t`, it might be relevant to the loop execution. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters in `t`, `n` is an empty string**
