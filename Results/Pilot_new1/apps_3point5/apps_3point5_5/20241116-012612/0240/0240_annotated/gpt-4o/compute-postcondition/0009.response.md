According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more permutations of the `chars` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the `perm` string needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings**
