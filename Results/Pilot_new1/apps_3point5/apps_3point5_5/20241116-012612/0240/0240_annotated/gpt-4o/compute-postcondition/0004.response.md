Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
