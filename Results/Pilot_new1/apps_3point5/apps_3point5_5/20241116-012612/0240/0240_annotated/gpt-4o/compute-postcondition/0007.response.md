Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is the next permutation of `chars`. The state of `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, and `candidate` is not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
