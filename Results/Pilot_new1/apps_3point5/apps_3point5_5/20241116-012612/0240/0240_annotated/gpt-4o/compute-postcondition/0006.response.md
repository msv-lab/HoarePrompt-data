Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars` as well. The other variables `chars`, `perm`, `sub` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
