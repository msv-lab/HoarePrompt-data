Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, so the remainder is the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`**
