Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, after running the code, `n` will hold a non-negative integer value entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer**
