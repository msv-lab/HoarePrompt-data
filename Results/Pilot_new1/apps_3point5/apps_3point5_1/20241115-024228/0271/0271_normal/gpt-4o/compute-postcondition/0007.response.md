Example Answer: 
`result` is printed, which is calculated based on the value of `remainder` and `n`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, and `remainder` is the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and the result is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and the result is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above**
