Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the last digit of `n` which is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the value of `result` is determined by subtracting the last digit of `n` from `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and less than or equal to 5, `result` is the result of subtracting the last digit of `n` from `n`**
