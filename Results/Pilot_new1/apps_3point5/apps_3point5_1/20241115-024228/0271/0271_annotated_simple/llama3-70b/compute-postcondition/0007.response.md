Example Answer:
The code calculates n + (10 - n % 10). Since n % 10 is larger than 5, the result of (10 - n % 10) will be less than 10. Adding this to n will result in a number that ends in 0. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and n % 10 is larger than 5.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and n % 10 is larger than 5**
