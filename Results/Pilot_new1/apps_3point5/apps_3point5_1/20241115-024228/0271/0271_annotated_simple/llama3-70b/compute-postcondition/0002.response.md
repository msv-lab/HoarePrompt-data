Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer divisible by 10. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can assume that `n` is any non-negative integer that is divisible by 10. Therefore, the output state is simply the value of `n`.
Output State: **n (where n is a non-negative integer divisible by 10)**
