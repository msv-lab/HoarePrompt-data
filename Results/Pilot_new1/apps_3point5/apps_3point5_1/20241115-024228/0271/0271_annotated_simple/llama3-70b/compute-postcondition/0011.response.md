Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user input. If n is divisible by 10, it prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, it adjusts n based on the remainder of n divided by 10: if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it prints n minus the remainder; if the remainder is greater than 5, it prints n plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function operates within the constraints of n being a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9.**
