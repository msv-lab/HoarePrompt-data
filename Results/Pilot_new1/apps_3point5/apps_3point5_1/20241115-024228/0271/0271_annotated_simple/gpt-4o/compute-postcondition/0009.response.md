Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer input from the user, calculates the remainder of dividing that input by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, adjusts the result by subtracting the remainder if it's less than or equal to 5, or adding the difference between 10 and the remainder if it's between 6 and 9. The final result is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.**
