Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
