Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n minus its last digit. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the program prints n plus the difference between 10 and its last digit. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program execution based on the conditions specified, ensuring the final state of the program variables.***
