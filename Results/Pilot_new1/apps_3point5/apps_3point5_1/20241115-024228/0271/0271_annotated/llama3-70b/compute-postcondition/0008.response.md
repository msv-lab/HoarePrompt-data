Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that n % 10 is not equal to 0. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n minus its last digit. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the program prints n plus the difference between 10 and its last digit. This covers all possible scenarios of the program execution based on the conditions specified.***
