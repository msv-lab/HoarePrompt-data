Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the input number is divisible by 10, and if so, it prints the number as is. If the input number is not divisible by 10, it rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0 by adjusting based on the last digit. The annotations also confirm that the code covers all possible scenarios based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the logic of the code. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
