Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if the input number ends with 0. If it does, it prints the number as is. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest number ending with 0. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest number ending with 0. The logic provided covers all possible scenarios and the program produces the correct output for all test cases.
