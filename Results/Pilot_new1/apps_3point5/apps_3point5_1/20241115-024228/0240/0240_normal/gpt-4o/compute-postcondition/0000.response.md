According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings `chars` and `sub`. If both strings are non-empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `perm` is not defined, so it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `chars` and `sub` need to be non-empty strings.
State: **Precondition**: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring of `chars`.**
