According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of characters in `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with the input `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.**
