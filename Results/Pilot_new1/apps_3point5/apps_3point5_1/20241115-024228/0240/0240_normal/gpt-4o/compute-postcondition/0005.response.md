According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string. To execute one more time, the `chars` should have more permutations left to iterate over. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the number of permutations of `chars` that are left to iterate over.
State: **`candidate` is a string and there are more permutations of `chars` left to iterate over**
