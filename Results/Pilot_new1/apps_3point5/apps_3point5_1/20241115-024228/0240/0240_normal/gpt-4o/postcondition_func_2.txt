The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing a number, and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`. The function iterates through permutations of characters in `chars`, joins them to form a candidate string, and checks if the candidate string is a valid number according to the `sub` string. If the candidate meets the criteria, it yields the candidate. If either `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the function does not yield any candidates.
