Output State: **After the loop executes, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining permutations of characters in `chars`. If `candidate` meets the criteria of being a valid number according to the `sub` string, then the function yields `candidate`. If the loop does not execute due to `chars` or `sub` being empty strings, there will be no changes to the initial state.**
