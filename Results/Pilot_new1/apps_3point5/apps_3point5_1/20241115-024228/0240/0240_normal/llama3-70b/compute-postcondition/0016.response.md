The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. The function then returns the final integer value of `n` after concatenation with `t` based on the characters in `s` that are also present in `t_set`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the final integer value of `n` after concatenation with `t` based on the characters in `s` that are also present in `t_set`.
