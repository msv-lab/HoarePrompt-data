Output State: **If `t_set` is empty or `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. If `t_set` is not empty and `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate through each character in `s`. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, it will be appended to the string `n`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, after the loop executes, `n` will contain the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`.**
