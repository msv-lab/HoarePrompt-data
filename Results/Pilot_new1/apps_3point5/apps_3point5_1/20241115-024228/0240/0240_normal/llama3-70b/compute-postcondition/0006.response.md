According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` still has characters left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is updated by appending `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` should still have characters left to iterate through. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` to indicate that there are still characters left in the string.
State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string**
