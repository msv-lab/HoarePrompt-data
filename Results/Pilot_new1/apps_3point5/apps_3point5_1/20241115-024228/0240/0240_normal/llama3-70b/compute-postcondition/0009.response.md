According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters left in string `s`. If there are still characters left to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string. If character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, then it is appended to the string `n`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string**
