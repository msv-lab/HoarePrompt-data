Postcondition: ***`s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string. If character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` is updated by concatenating `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
