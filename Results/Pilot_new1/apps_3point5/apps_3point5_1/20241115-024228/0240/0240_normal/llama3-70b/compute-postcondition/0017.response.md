Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It iterates through each character in `s` and appends the character to the string `n` if it is present in the set `t_set`. Then, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the final integer value of `n`. If `t_set` is empty or `s` is an empty string, the function will return 0 as the final integer value. **
