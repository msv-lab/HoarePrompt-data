According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in the string `s` and the characters in the set `t_set`. If the next character in `s` is in `t_set`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty with more characters to iterate, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string updated with the next character added if `c` is in `t_set`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be in `t_set`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is: `s` should be the remaining part of the string after the last character that was processed in the previous iteration.

State: **`s` is the remaining part of the string after the last character that was processed in the previous iteration, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string updated with the next character added if `c` is in `t_set`**
