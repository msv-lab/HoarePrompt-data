The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars`, a non-empty string of digits, and `sub`, a string of digits. It generates permutations of `chars`, forms a `candidate` by joining each permutation, and yields the candidate if it passes the validity check with `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. The function does not have a specified return value provided.
