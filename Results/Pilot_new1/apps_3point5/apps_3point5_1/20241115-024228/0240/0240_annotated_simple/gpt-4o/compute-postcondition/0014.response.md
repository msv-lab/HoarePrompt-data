Output State: **If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute. If `chars` is not empty, the loop generates all permutations of `chars` and checks if the candidate formed by joining the permutations is a valid number with respect to `sub`. If it is valid, the function yields the candidate. No other changes occur in the state of the program.**
