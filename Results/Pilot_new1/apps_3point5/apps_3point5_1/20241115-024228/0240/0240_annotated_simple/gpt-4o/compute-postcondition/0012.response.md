Postcondition: ***`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. If the `candidate` passes the validation check by the function `is_valid_number` with the parameter `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
