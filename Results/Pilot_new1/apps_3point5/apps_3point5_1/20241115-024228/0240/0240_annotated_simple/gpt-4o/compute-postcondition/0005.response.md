According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of `perm`. To execute one more time, the next permutation needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `perm` variable to the next permutation in order for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of `perm`**
