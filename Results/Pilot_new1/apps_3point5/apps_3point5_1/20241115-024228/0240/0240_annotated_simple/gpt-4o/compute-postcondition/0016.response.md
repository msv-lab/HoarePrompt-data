Functionality: ** The function generate_possible_numbers accepts two parameters: chars and sub. It generates all possible permutations of the characters in chars and yields the candidate if it is a valid number according to the is_valid_number function with respect to sub. The function does not have a specific output other than yielding valid candidates. The annotations suggest that the function operates correctly, generating permutations and checking for validity. **
