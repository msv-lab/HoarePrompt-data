Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of `perm`. The previous value of `perm` is unknown, so the output state is `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`**
