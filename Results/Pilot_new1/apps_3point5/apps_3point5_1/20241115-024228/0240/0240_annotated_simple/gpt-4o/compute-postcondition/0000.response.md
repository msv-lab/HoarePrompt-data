According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `perm` and `chars`. If `chars` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the precondition is that `chars` is a string representing a number with no leading zeroes, and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n` that may contain leading zeroes. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `perm` should be set to the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **Precondition**: **chars is a string representing a number with no leading zeroes, sub is a string representing a substring of n that may contain leading zeroes, perm is the first permutation of chars**
