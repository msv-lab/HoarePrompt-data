According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. To execute one more time, the next permutation of `perm` needs to be considered, and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` must return true. 
State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`.**
