Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created from the string `t`, which means `t_set` contains all unique characters present in the string `t`. The previous values of `t` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s. `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`.
Output State: **Precondition: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of s. `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`**
