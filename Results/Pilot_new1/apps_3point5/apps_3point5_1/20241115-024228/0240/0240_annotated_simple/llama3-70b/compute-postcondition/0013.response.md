Output State: **If `t_set` is empty, the loop won't execute and `n` will remain an empty string. If `t_set` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character in `s` and concatenate it to `n` if it is present in `t_set`. At the end of the loop, `n` will contain only the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`.**
