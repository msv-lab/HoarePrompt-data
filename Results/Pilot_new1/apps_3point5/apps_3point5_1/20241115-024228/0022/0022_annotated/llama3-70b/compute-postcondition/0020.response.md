Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input, calculates the length of the string, and then checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If the characters do not match, the flag `is_spalindrome` is set to False. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. The function assumes `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. However, the function lacks a return value.**
