According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is True. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to cover the next iteration where `i` is less than half of `n`.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is True**
