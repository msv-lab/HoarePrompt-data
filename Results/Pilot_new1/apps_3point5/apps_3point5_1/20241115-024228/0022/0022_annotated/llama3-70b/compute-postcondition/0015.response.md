Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is a boolean. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. This condition covers all edge cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` do not match, leading to `is_spalindrome` being False and breaking out of the loop.***
