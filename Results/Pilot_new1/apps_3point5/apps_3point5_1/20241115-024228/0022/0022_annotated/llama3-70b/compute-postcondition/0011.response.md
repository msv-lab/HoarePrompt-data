Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This covers all possible cases where the palindrome check fails and updates the `is_spalindrome` flag accordingly.***
