According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n // 2**
