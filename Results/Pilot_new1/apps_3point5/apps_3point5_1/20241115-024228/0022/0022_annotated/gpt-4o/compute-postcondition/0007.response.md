Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This covers all possible scenarios where the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, resulting in the function returning False.***
