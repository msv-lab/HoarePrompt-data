Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This condition covers all edge cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal in the string `s`.***
