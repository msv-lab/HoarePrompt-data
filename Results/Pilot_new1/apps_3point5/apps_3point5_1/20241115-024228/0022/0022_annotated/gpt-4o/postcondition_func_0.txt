The function func_1 accepts a parameter s, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It iterates through the string to check if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function handles both even and odd length strings correctly. If the input string has a length less than 2, the function immediately returns True.
