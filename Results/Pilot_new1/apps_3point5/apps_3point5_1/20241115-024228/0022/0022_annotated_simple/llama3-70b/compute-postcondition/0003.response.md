According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 2 (since n // 2 will be at least 1). Before the loop starts, `is_spalindrome` is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
