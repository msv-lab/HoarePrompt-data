Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True**
