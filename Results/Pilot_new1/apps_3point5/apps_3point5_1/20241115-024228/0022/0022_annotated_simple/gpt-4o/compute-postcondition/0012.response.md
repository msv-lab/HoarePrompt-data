Output State: **s is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer representing the length of the string and n is at least 2. If s[i] is not equal to s[n - 1 - i] for any i in the range of n // 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without altering the initial state. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
