Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function correctly checks if a given string is an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the second half. If at any point the characters do not match, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The function covers all potential cases and correctly determines if a string is an "s-palindrome" or not.
