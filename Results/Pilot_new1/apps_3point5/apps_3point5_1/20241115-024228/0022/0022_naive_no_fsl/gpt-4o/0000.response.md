Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the input string `s` is symmetric about the middle. It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character in the second half. If at any point they are not equal, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The main part of the program takes the input string, calls the `func_1` function, and prints "TAK" if the function returns True, and "NIE" otherwise. This logic correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases where the input string is not symmetric about the middle.
