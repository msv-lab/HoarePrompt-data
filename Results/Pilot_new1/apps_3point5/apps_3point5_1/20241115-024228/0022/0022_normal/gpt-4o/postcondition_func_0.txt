The function func_1 accepts a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the characters of `s` comparing the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` for each `i` in the range of `n // 2`. If any pair of characters are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If all character pairs are equal, the function returns True.
