Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` and at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is an integer. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `(n - i - 1)`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This condition covers all possible cases where the palindrome property is violated in the string `s`.***
