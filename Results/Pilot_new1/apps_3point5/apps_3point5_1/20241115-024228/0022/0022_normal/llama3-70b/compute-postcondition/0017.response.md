Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` and at least 2. `is_spalindrome` is True initially. If any character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `(n - i - 1)`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This loop checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.**
