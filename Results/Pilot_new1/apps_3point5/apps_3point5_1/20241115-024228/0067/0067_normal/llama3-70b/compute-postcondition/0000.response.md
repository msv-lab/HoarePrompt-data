Example Answer:
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned by mapping the input string to integers. The input is split into three parts, and each part is assigned to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. Since the input values are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, the output state is `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
