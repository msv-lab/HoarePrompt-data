Example Answer:
x, y, z are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of x, y, z can range from 0 to 100 as they are non-negative integers. Therefore, the Output State is: x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
