Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown. It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the input values.

If the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum possible downvotes, the code correctly prints a dash. If the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints a plus sign. Otherwise, it prints a question mark to indicate uncertainty.

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases provided in the examples. The output hints also agree with the code logic, confirming that the code is correct.
