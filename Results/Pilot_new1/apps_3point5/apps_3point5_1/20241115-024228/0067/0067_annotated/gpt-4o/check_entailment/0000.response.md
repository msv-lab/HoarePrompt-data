Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

An example where the code does not work as expected is when the input is "0 0 1". According to the problem description, the output should be "?", indicating that the result is uncertain. However, the code will output "+", which is incorrect.

The annotations mention that the program will print a plus sign if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, or a question mark if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`. This logic is flawed as it does not cover the case where the result is uncertain due to the presence of unknown votes.
