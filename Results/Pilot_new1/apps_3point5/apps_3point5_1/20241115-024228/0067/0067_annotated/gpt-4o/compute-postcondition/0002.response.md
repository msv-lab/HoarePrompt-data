Example Answer: 
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` is the same as `min_upvotes`. Therefore, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. 
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`**
