Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, indicating that max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes. Additionally, the condition (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) is false, meaning max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes. After the execution of the if else block, the program will either print a plus sign if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, or a question mark if max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes.***
