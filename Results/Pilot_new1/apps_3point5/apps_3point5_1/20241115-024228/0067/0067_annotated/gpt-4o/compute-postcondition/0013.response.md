Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The program will either print a plus sign if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, or a question mark if max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes. The conditions for the if and elif parts are explicitly covered, ensuring that all possible cases are accounted for, including edge cases where the values are equal or when the difference between max_upvotes and min_downvotes is minimal.***
