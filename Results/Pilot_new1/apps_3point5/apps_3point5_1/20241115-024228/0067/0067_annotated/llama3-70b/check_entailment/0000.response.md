Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code only handles specific scenarios where `x` is greater than `y + z`, `x` is less than `y`, `x` equals `y`, or `z` equals 0. However, it does not cover all possible combinations of `x`, `y`, and `z` as described in the problem description. 

For example, the code does not handle the case when `x` is equal to `y` but `z` is not 0, which should result in printing `?`. This scenario is not covered in the code implementation.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
