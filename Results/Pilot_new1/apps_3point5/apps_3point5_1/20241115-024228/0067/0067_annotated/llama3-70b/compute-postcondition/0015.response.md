Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x is equal to y and z is equal to 0, the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not equal to 0, the program prints '?'. Otherwise, if x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'. The condition x is not greater than y + z is satisfied. x is greater than or equal to y. x is not equal to y.***
