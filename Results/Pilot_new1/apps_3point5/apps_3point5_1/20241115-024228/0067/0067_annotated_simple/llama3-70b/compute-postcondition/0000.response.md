Example Answer:
The values of x, y, and z are assigned based on the input split by space. Since the input is not specified, the values of x, y, and z can be any non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
