Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `i` is 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color with the count of `color` being 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2` and less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added to `window_counts` with a count of 0.***
