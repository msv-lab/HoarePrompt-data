According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`found` is False, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is equal to `i`**
