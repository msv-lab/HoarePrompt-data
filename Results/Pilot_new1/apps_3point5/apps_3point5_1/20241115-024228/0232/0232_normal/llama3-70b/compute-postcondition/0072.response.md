Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list. `n` is a positive integer. `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n. `i` is 1. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color with the count of `color` being 1. `j` is equal to `i + 1` and less than `n`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. After the if statement, `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`. If the condition in the if statement is met, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. This condition ensures that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged.***
