Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input for the number of colors, the list of colors, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color.
- It then iterates through the colors to check if there is a sequence of colors that matches the desired counts.
- If such a sequence is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints agree with the code logic.
