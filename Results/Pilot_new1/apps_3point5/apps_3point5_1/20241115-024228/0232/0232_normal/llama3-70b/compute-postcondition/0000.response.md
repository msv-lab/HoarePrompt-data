Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, where each color is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, such that the sum of all counts is at least 1 and at most n.**
