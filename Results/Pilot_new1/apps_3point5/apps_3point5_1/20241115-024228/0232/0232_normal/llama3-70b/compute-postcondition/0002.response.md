Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the result of mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected, and the list `colors` is not modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input**
