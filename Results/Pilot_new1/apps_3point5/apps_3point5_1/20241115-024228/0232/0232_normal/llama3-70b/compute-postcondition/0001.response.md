Example Answer:
The list `colors` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The length of the list `colors` is `n`, and each element in the list represents a color of lightsaber. The values of the list are not known as they depend on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers**
