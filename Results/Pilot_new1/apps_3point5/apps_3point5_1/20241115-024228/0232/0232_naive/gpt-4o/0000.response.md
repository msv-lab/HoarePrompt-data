Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by using a sliding window approach to find if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It maintains a window with the desired color counts and checks if all the colors have the required counts within that window. The program iterates through the colors and updates the counts accordingly. If at any point, the window contains the desired color counts, it returns 'YES'. If no such interval is found, it returns 'NO'. The logic seems sound and covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
