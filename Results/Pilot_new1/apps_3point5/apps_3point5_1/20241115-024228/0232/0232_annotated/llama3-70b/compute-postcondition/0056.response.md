Example Answer:
The value of `j` is equal to `i`, and the value of `color` is assigned as the value at index `j` in the list `colors`. The dictionary `window_counts` remains empty, and the loop variables `i` and `j` are unchanged. 
Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`**
