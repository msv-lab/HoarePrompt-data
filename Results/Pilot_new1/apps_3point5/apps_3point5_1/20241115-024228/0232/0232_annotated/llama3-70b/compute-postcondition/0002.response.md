Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the result of mapping each input value to an integer. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n**
