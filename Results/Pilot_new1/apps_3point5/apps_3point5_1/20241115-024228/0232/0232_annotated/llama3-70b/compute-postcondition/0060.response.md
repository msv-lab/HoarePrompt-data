Example Answer:
The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the `color` key is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`.
Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`**
