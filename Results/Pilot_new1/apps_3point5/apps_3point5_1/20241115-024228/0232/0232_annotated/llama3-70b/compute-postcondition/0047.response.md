Postcondition: ***After incrementing the value associated with the key `color` in `window_counts` by 1, the program ensures that `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains True, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is still `i+1`, `colors` list still has at least 1 color, and `window_counts` maintains `color` as a key with an updated value. If all counts in `window_counts` values are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
