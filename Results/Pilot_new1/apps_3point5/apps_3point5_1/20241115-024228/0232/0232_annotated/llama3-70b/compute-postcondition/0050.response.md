Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `colors` list has at least 1 color, `window_counts` dictionary contains the count of each color encountered so far, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, `color` is not in `window_counts`, and the condition for all counts in `window_counts` to be equal to the corresponding counts in `counts` is met, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute and the values of the variables remain as in the initial state.***
