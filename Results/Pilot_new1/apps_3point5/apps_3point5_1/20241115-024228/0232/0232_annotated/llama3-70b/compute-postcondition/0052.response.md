Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `found` is True and all conditions are met, including `n` being greater than 0, `i` being less than `n`, `colors` list having at least 1 color, `window_counts` containing counts of each color encountered, `j` being equal to `i`, `color` being assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, and `color` not being in `window_counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their initial values. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if statement.***
