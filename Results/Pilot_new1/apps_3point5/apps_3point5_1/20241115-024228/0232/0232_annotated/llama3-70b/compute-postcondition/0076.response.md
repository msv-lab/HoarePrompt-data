Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the new `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `color` is assigned a new value from `colors` at index `j`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, and the value of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1.***
