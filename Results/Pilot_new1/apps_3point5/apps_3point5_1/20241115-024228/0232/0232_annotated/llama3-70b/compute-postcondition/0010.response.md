Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers with at least 2 colors, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n; color_counts is a dictionary updated with the counts of each color, color is the second color in the list. If color is not already in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is set to 0. After executing the code snippet, color_counts[color] is incremented by 1.**
