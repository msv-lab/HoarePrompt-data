Correctness: False

The program does not fully follow the problem description. The code should check if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with exactly the specified counts of lightsabers for each color. However, the code only checks for the presence of any interval where the counts of colors match the desired counts, without considering the contiguous requirement. 

For example, if the input is:
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

The program will output "YES" because it finds a combination of colors that matches the desired counts, but it does not check if this combination forms a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights. This is a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
