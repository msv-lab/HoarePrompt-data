Output State: **If the desired counts of all colors in `desired_counts` are already met in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop continues to adjust the counts in `current_counts` until all desired counts are met. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0 and will continue until there is a color count in `current_counts` that is less than the desired count in `desired_counts`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values remain as initialized: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer type, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.**
