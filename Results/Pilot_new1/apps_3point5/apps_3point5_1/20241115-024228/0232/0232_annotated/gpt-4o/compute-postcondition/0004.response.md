Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. The initial state of the variables is not provided, so the output state is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
