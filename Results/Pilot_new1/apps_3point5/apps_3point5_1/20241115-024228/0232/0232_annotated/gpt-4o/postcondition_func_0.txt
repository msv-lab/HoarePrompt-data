The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It initializes `desired_counts` with the desired counts of colors. Then, it iterates through the colors, updating `current_counts` accordingly. If all desired counts are met, it returns 'YES'. If not, it continues adjusting the counts until all desired counts are reached. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and 'NO' is returned.
