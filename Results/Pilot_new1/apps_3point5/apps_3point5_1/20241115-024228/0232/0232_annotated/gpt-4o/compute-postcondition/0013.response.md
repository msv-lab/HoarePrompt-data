Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type with at least one color count less than the desired count; `left` is 0; `right` is 1; `n` is greater than 0. If all color counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not have an else part, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
