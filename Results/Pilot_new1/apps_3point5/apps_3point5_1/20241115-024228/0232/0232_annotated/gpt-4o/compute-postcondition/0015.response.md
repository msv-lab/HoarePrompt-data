Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal to the corresponding counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, `current_counts` will have at least one color count less than the desired count, `left` will have a value greater than 0, `right` will have a value of 1, and `n` will be greater than 0. The loop will continue until there is a color count in `current_counts` that is less than the desired count in `desired_counts`.**
