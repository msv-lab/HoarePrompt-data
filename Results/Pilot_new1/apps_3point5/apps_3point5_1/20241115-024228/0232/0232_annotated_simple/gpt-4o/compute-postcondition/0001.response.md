Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a defaultdict with initial values of 0 for all keys. This means that `current_counts` is a dictionary that will store counts for each color from 1 to m, with initial counts set to 0. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with initial counts of 0 for all keys**
