Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly initializes the desired counts of lightsabers for each color and the current counts of lightsabers for each color.
2. It iterates through the list of colors and updates the current counts accordingly.
3. It uses a sliding window approach to check if there exists a contiguous interval with the desired counts of lightsabers for each color.
4. If such an interval is found, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, ensuring correctness.
