Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k, `current_counts` is a dictionary with initial counts of 0 for all keys, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `current_counts` is updated with the count of the color at index `right` incremented by 1. If all the current counts of colors match the desired counts for each color in the desired counts dictionary, the function returns 'YES'.***
