Example Answer:
desired_counts is assigned a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to m and the values are taken from the list k. The values of m and k are known from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$ and desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to values from list k.
