Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence, `i` is either equal to `j` or incremented by 1 depending on the loop iteration, `n` remains the same or is greater than `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then it is added with the value 0, If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False.**
