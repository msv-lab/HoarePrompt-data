Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to `j`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
