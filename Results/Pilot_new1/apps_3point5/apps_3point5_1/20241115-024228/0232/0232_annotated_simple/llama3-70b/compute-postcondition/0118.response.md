Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each `color` encountered in the loop is a key, and the corresponding value is the count of that color. `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to the last value of the loop, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. All values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. The variable `found` is set to True if the condition is met, and the loop terminates. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `i` is greater than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is not assigned, and `found` remains False. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and summarizes the program's state after the loop execution.***
