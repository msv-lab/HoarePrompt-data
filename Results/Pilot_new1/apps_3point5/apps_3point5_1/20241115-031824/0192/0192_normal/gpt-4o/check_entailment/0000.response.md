Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The formula used in the code, ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2), accurately represents the process of transforming the triangle side lengths from x to y in the minimum number of steps. The code is simple, efficient, and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code and support the fact that the code is correct for all scenarios.
