Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by mapping the input to integers. Since the input is split, `x` and `y` are assigned accordingly. The values of `x` and `y` are integers and satisfy the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that 3 ≤ x ≤ 100,000, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < x.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 ≤ x ≤ 100,000, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < x**
