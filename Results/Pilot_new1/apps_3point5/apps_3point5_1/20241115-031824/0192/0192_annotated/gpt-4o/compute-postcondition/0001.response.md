Example Answer: 
The expression calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Given that x is an integer between 3 and 100,000 and y is an integer between 3 and x, the result will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that 3 ≤ x ≤ 100,000, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < x, and the result of the expression is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 ≤ x ≤ 100,000, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < x, and the result of the expression is a non-negative integer**
