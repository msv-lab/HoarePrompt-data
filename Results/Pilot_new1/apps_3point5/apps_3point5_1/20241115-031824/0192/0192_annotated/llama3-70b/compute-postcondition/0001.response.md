Example Answer: 
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs` function and prints the result. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the absolute difference between them will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between them is printed.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between them is printed**
