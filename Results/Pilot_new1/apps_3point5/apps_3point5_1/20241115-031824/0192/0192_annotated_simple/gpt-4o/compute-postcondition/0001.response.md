Example Answer: 
The expression calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Since x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is a non-negative integer**
