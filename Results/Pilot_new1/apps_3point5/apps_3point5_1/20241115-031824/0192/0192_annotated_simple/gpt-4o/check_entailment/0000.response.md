Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes the input of the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths, calculates the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y, and prints the result. The logic used in the program is correct as it calculates the number of seconds required by taking the absolute difference between the two side lengths and dividing it by 2, then adding the remainder if the difference is odd. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given examples. Hence, the program is correct.
