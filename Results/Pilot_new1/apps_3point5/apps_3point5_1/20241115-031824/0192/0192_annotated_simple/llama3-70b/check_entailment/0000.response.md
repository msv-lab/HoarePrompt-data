Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths x and y, which does not reflect the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. 

For example, if we input 6 and 3, the program would output 3, but the correct output should be 4 according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
