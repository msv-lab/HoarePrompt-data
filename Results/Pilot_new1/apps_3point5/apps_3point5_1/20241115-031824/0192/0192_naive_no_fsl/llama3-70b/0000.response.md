Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. It does this by simply taking the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to modify the sides of the triangle to reach the desired length. The program works for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
