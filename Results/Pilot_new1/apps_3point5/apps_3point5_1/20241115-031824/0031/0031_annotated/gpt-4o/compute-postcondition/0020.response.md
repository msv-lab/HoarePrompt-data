Output State: **After the loop executes, `MOD` remains 1000003, `total_days` remains 1 << n, `numerator` contains the result of the product of (total_days - i) for each iteration modulo MOD, `denominator` contains the result of the product of total_days for each iteration modulo MOD. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.**
