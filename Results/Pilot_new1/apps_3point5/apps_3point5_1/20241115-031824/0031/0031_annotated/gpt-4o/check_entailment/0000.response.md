Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code, the functions provided seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The func_1 function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is necessary for simplifying the fraction. The func_2 function correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland for a given n and k, and then simplifies the fraction as required.

The code handles the edge cases mentioned in the annotations, such as when k is greater than 2 to the power of n, and provides the correct output for those cases. Additionally, the code provides the expected output for the examples given in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
