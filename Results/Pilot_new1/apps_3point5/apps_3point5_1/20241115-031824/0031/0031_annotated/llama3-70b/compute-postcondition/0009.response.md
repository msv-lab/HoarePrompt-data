According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated as `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days` - `i`), `denominator` is updated as `denominator` multiplied by `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated as `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days` - 2`), `denominator` is updated as `denominator` multiplied by `total_days`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
