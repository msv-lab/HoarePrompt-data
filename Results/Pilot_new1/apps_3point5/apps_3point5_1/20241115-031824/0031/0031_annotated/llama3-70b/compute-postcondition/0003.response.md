According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is calculated as 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted so that k is greater than 0 and i is 0.
State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
