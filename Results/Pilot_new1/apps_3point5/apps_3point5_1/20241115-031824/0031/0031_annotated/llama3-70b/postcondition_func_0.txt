The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both being integers. It calculates `total_days` as 2 raised to the power of `n`, then iterates `k` times to update `numerator` and `denominator` accordingly. After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides both by this gcd, and returns the remainders of these divisions by (10^6 + 3). The function calculates and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
