Example Answer:
`numerator` is updated by multiplying its current value by (`total_days` - `i`), where `i` is 2. The value of `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
