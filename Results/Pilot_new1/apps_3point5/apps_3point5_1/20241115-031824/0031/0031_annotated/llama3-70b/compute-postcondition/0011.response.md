Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The values of `numerator`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
