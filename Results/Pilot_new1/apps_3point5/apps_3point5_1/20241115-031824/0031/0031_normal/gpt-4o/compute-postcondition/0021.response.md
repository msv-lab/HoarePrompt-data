Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated using the formula provided, where `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator and `p_no_shared` is either calculated based on a formula or remains 1. The value of `MOD` is not provided, so it is considered unknown. The output state is: `p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, and `p_shared` is calculated using the formula provided.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, and `p_shared` is calculated using the formula provided**
