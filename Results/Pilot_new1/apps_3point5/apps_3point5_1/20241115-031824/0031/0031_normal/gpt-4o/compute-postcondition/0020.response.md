Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator calculated based on the formula. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. The value of p_total is assigned the value of denominator. The previous values of p_no_shared and p_total are unknown, so the output state is: p_no_shared is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, p_total is assigned the value of denominator.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, p_total is assigned the value of denominator**
