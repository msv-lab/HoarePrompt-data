According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
