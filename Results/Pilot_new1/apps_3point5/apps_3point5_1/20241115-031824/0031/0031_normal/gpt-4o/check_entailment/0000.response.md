Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, as described in the problem statement.
- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a correct implementation.
- `func_2` calculates the probability of at least two out of `k` people sharing the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days, and prints the irreducible fraction modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The code handles the case where `k` is greater than `2^n` correctly by printing `1 1`.
- The code correctly calculates the probability using the given formula and prints the result modulo 10^6 + 3.

Overall, the code follows the problem description for every potential case, and the output hints align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct.
