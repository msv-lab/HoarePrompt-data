The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the remainders of the numerator and denominator after dividing by 10^6 + 3. The function computes the numerator as the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range k, and the denominator as the product of total_days for each i in the range k. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, and divides both by the gcd. Finally, it returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator after dividing by 10^6 + 3.
