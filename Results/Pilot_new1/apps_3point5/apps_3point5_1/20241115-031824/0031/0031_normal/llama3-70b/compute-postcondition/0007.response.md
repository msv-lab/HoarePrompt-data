Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by the result of `total_days - i`. The value of `total_days` is calculated based on the initial value of `n`, and `i` is 1. The value of `numerator` is unchanged, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, and `i` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 1.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 1**
