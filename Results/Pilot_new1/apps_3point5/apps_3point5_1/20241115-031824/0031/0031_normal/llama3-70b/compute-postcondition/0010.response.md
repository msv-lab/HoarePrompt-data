Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by the result of `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `i` is 2. The value of `numerator` is unchanged, `total_days` is updated based on the value of `n`, and `denominator` is updated based on the new value of `total_days`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, i is 2.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, i is 2**
