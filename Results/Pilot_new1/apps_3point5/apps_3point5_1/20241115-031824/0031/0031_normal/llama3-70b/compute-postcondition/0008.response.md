Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is calculated based on the value of `n`. The value of `numerator` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 1. Therefore, the output state is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 1.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 1**
