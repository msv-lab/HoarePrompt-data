Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`. The value of `numerator` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, i is 2.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, i is 2**
