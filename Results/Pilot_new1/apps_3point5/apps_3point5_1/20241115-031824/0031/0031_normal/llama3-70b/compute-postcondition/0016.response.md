Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is divided by `gcd` and assigned back to `denominator`. The previous values of `denominator` and `gcd` are needed to calculate the result.
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in range(k), denominator is the product of total_days for each i in range(k), gcd is the greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator after dividing numerator by gcd.**
