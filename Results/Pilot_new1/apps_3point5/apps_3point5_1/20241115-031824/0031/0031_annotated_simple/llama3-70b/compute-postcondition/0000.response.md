`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. The value of `total_days` is calculated by raising 2 to the power of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
