Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland as described in the problem statement.
2. It handles the cases where k is 0 or negative correctly by keeping the numerator as 1 and the denominator as total_days.
3. The program calculates the irreducible fraction A/B by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator and then returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3) as required.
4. The program uses the correct formula and logic to calculate the probability and irreducible fraction, ensuring the correctness of the output for all potential cases.
