Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the product of consecutive decreasing values from (total_days - k + 1) to total_days in the numerator, and the product of total_days in the denominator. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the numerator remains 1 and the denominator remains total_days.**
