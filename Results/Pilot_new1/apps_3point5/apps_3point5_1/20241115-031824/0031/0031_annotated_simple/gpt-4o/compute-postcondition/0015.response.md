Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The current value of `total_days` is calculated as 1 shifted left by `n`, and the initial value of `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is the updated value after the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after the calculation, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is the updated value after the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after the calculation, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
