The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for `n` and `k` are that they are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function does not return anything unless k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, in which case the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it does not return anything.
