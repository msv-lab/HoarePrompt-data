The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates through a loop where `a` and `b` are updated based on certain operations until `b` becomes 0. The final value of integer `a` after the loop iteration is returned as the output. If `b` is initially 0, the loop does not execute at all.
