According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
