According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value after the calculation, `denominator` is updated value after the calculation, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
