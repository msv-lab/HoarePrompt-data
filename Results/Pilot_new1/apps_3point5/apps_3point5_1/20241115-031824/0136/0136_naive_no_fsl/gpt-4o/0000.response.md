Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b from input as whole lines or tokens, as specified in the problem description.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both a and b using the lstrip() function.
3. It then compares the lengths of a and b, and if they are not equal, it prints "<" if a is less than b, ">" if a is greater than b, and "=" if they are equal.
4. The program correctly handles the case where a and b have leading zeroes and compares the numbers without considering the leading zeroes.
5. The program covers all the specified cases in the problem description and prints the correct output symbol ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison of a and b.
