Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, removes any leading zeros, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The code handles cases where `a` and `b` are very long integers represented as strings with no leading zeros. The annotations also confirm that the code handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings and `a` is not equal to `b`. Therefore, the code is correct.
