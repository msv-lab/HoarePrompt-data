Output State: **`a`, `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros. If `a` is 0, `a` is set to '0'. If `b` is empty or evaluates to false, `b` is set to '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, and the length of `b` is less than the length of `a`**
