Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly compares the two input numbers after removing leading zeros and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison. However, the program does not handle the case where the input numbers are equal but one of them contains leading zeros. 

For example, if the input is:
```
00012345
12345
```
According to the problem description, the output should be "=", but the program will output ">" because it compares the numbers after removing leading zeros.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
