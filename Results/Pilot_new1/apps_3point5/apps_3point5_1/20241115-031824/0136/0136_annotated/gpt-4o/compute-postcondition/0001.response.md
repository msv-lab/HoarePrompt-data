Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` with leading zeros removed. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeros from the string. The output state will be the updated value of `a` after removing leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer**
