Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed and updated to '0' if empty, `b` is a string with leading zeros removed from the element at index 1 of `data` and updated to '0' if empty. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The program handles all edge cases where `a` and `b` can be empty strings or have different lengths, ensuring correct comparison and output.***
