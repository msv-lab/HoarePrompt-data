Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input with leading zeros stripped. The input is a string, so `b` will be a string with leading zeros stripped. The variable `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped**
