The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses two variables `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. The function calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and returns the result as a string.
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of two non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, and returns the result as a string.**
