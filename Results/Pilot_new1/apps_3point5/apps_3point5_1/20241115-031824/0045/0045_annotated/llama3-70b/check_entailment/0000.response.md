Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations explain that the function accurately computes the GCD for the given input integers. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the code does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
