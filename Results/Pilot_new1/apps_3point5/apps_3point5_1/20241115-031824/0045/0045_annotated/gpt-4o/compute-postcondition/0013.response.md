According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is -1, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is `k - 1` and the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 2`.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is -1, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
