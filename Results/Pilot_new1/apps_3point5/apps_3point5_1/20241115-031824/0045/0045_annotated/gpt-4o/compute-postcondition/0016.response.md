Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is either -1 or a non-zero value, `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If the `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. After the execution of the code snippet, the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1.**
