The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum`, which is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `min_sum` and `n`.

In Case 2, the function returns a list 'sequence' with consecutive multiples of 'd' from 1 to 'k', where the value at index 'i' is incremented by 1 until 'remainder' reaches 0. If 'k' is less than 1, the function returns the original 'sequence'.

However, the code does not handle the case where `k` is equal to 0 which could potentially lead to division by zero error when calculating `d`. This missing edge case should be considered for completeness.
