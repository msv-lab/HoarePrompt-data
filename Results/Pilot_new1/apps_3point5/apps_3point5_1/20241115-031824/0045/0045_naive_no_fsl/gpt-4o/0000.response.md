Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. If a sequence is possible, it calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It then calculates the remainder to distribute among the elements of the sequence to maximize the greatest common divisor.
5. The program then constructs the sequence by multiplying each element by d and adding any remaining remainder to the elements in decreasing order.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise prints -1.

The program follows the problem description and handles all cases where a valid sequence can be formed to maximize the greatest common divisor.
