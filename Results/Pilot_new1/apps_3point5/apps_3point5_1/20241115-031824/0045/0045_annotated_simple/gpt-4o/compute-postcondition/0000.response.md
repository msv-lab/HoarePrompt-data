Example Answer:
`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided**
