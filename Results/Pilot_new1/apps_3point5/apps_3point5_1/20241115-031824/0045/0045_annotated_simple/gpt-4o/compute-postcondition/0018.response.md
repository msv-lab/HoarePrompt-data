According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from `k - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `remainder` is decreased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be decreased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, `k` is decreased by 1**
