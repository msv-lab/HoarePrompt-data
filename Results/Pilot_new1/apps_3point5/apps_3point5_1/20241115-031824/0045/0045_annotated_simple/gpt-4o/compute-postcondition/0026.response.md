The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. The function calculates `min_sum` based on a formula provided. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, the program returns the updated sequence after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate `min_sum` based on a formula, and return either -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, or the updated sequence after the loop execution if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`.
