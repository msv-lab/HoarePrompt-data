Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the minimum sum based on the formula provided, and then proceeds to generate a sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The program correctly handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1. 

The program then calculates the sequence based on the given conditions and updates the sequence accordingly. The loop that handles the remainder ensures that the resulting sequence has the desired properties. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the input parameters.
