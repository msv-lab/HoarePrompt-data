Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates `min_sum` based on a provided formula. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function updates the sequence based on the calculations and returns the updated sequence after the loop execution. The loop updates the sequence by incrementing values in a specific pattern, and if there is a remainder, it distributes it across the sequence. The functionality covers the case where `min_sum` is greater than `n`, returning -1, and the case where the sequence is updated and returned after the loop execution.**
