Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` have been updated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the previous values**
