Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values. Since `b` evaluates to True, it means `b` is not equal to 0. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the previous values, and `b` evaluates to True**
