The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It calculates the value of min_sum based on k. If min_sum is greater than n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it updates a sequence list by incrementing the last element until a remainder reaches 0. The function returns the updated sequence list after the loop executes.
