Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. The value of `min_sum` is dependent on `k`, but the specific calculation is not provided. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1, otherwise, `d` is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the program either returns -1 or `d` is calculated based on the value of `min_sum`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the program either returns -1 or `d` is calculated based on the value of `min_sum`**
