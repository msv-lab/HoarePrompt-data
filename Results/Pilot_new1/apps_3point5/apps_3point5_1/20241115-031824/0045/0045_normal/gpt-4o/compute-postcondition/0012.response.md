Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `remainder` is equal to -1. When the remainder is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
