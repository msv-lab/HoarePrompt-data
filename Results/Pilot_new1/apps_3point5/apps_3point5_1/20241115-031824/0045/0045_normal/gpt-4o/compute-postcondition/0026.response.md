The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. The value of `min_sum` is calculated based on the value of `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. The program returns the updated sequence list after the loop executes.
