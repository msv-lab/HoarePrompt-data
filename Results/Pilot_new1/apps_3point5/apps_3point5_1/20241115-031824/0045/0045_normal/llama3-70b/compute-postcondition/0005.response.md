According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has a new value and `b` has a new value after the calculation of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be non-zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` has a new value, `b` has a new value after the calculation of `a % b`**
