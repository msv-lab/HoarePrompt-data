Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters 'a' and 'b'. It then performs a loop where 'a' and 'b' are updated iteratively until 'b' becomes 0. The final value of 'a' after the loop terminates is returned. If 'b' is initially 0, the loop does not execute. The function aims to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b'.**
