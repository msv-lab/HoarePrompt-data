Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `a` now holds the previous value of `b` and `b` now holds the result of `a % b`. Since `b` is still truthy, the new values of `a` and `b` are calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a` has a new value, `b` has a new value after the calculation of `a % b`**
