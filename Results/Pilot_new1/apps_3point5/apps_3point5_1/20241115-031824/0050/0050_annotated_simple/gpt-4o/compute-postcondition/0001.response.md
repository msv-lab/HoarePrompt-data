Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input string. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing integers obtained from input**
