Postcondition: ***`list b` contains integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is an integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. `i` and `n` retain their initial values. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop. All edge cases including the scenarios where `r` is equal to `s[i]` are covered in the postcondition.***
