Postcondition: ***`list b` contains integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is an integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is broken. The variables `i` and `n` retain their initial values.***
