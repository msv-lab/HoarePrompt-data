Postcondition: ***`list b` contains integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is updated, `r` is adjusted based on the last iteration, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop. All variables maintain their initial values and the conditions of the descending order are preserved after the execution of the if else block.***
