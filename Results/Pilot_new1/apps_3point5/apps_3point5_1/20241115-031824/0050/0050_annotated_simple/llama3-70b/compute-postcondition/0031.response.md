Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `b` is not empty, `r` is positive and not less than the first element of `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
