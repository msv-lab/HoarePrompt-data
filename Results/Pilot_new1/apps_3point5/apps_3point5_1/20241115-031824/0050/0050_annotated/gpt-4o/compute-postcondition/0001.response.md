Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input**
