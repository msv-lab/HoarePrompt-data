Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` with `remaining_bourles`. The final output is printed as `total_bourles`.***
