Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the values entered through input after splitting them. The values are integers, so the list `b` contains integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing integers entered through input**
