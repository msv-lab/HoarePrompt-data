Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `r` is greater than or equal to the next element in list `b`, `shares` is updated based on the floor division result of `r` by the element at index `i` in list `s`. If `r` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in list `s`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division result of `r` by the element at index `i` in list `s` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by the element at index `i` in list `s`. If `r` is less than the element at index `i` in list `s`, the loop breaks. The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, and `shares` after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
