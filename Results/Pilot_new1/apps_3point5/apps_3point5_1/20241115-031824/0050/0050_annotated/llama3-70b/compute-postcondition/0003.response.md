Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in ascending order by calling the `sort()` method. The values in the list `b` are rearranged in ascending order. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers entered through input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers entered through input**
