Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged unless the if part is executed where `shares` is updated by adding the result of floor division operation between `r` and `s[i]`, and `r` is updated by taking the modulus of `r` and `s[i]`. If the else part is executed, the values of `m`, `r`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
