According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is greater than or equal to s[0] plus the product of `shares` and the first element of list `b` in descending order, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is greater than or equal to s[0] plus the product of `shares` and the first element of list `b` in descending order, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1**
