Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads the input values, sorts the lists of buying and selling prices, calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial bourles, updates the bourles based on the selling prices, and finally prints the updated value of bourles. The code handles scenarios where the bourles are not enough to buy any shares, where the shares bought are not enough to sell, and where the selling prices are higher than the buying prices. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
