Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop.***
