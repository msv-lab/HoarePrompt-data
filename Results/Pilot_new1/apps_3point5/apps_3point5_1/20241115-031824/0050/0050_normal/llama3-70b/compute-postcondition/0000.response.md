Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not provided, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000**
