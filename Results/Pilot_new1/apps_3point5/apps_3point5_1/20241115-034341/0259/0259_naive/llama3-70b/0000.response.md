Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in a list of tuples representing the bus routes. It then calculates the time for each bus route to arrive after Serval reaches the station and determines the bus route with the minimum waiting time. The program outputs the bus route that Serval will use. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly handles the calculation of waiting times for each bus route and selects the bus route with the minimum waiting time.
