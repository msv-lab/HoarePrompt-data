Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the input values and chooses the route with the minimum wait time for Serval. The program iterates through all bus routes and considers different scenarios to determine the wait time accurately. The output is the chosen bus route for Serval, which is in line with the problem requirements. The program handles all possible cases and provides the correct output based on the input values.
