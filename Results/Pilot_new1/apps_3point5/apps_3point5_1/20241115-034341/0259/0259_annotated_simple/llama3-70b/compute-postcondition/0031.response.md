According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 4 tuples, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 3 tuples. To execute the loop one more time, the `buses` list must contain at least 4 tuples. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 4 tuples, `min_time` and `ans` may have been updated, `i`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged**
