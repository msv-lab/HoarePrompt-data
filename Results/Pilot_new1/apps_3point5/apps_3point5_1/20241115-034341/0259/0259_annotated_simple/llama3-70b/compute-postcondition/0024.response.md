Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least two tuples, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` if `time` is less than `min_time`, `ans` is the index of the tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are positive integers from the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is i + 1**
