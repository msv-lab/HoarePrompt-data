Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 3 tuples. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new time value, and `ans` is incremented by 1. The variables `i`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged. The time is recalculated as (t - s) % d.***
