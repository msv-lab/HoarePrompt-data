Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` contains 'bus1' and additional tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are positive integers. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
