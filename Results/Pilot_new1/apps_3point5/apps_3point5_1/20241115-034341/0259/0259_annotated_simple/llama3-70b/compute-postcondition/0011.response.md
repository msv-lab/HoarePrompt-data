According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers, `_` is incremented by 1**
