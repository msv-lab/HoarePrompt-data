Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then reads the arrival time and interval for each bus route and stores them in a list of tuples.
3. The program then iterates through the list of tuples, calculates the time for each bus route based on Serval's arrival time, and determines the bus route with the minimum waiting time.
4. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use, which is the route with the minimum waiting time.
5. The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for the given examples.
6. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the program does not handle correctly.
