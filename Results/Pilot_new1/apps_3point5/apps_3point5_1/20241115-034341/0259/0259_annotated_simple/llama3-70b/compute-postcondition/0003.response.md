Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1', `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1', `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it**
