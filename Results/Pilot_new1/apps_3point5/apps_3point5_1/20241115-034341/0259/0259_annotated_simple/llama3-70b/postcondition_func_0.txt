The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and the schedules of the buses. It then calculates the minimum time difference for each bus schedule with the input time `t` and prints the index of the bus with the minimum time difference. If `n` is 0, or the list of buses is empty, or the input values are invalid, the function does not perform any calculations and prints -1.
