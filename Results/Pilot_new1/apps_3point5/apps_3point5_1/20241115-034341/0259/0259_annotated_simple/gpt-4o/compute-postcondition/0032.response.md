Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, `wait_time` are all variables in the program. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i` are updated based on the conditions in the if block. `n` remains greater than 1, `s_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][0]`, `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 after the execution of the if else block. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases where `(t - s_i) % d_i` does not equal 0.***
