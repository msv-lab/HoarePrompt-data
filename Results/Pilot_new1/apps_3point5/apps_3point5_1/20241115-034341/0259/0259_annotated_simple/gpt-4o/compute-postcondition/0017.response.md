According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.**
