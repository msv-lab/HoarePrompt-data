Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route respectively. 

The function iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time based on the conditions provided, and determines the route with the minimum wait time. It then returns the route number with the minimum wait time.

Edge cases or missing functionality:
- If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the function will return -1 as the chosen route.
- If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, the function will choose the first encountered route as the chosen route.
