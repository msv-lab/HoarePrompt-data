Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are based on user input. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)`**
