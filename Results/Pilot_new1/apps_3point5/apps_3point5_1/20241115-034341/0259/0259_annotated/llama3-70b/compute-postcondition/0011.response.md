According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `t` satisfies the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, and `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)`. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is less than `n+1`**
