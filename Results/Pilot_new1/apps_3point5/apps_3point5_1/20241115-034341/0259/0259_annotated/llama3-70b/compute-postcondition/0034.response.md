The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a list of integers representing the waiting time for each bus route based on the given constraints and relationships. The waiting time is calculated as the difference between the time when the next bus arrives and the current time, taking into account the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between two buses for each route. The function handles multiple bus routes and calculates the waiting time for each route accordingly.
