Functionality: **The function reads input for the number of buses and the current time, then iterates through each bus's schedule to find the bus with the minimum waiting time. It calculates the waiting time for each bus based on the current time and the scheduled arrival time, and finally prints the index of the bus with the minimum waiting time. If the list of buses is empty, it prints -1.**
