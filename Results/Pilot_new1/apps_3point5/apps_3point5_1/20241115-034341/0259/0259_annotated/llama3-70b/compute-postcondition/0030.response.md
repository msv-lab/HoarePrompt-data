Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2. If the calculated `time` for the new tuple is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that the program maintains the minimum time and updates the corresponding answer index accordingly.***
