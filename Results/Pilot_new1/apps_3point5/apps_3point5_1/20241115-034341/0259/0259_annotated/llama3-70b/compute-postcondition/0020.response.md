Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The program variables retain their initial values with the addition of `min_time` and `ans` being potentially updated based on the condition of `time` being less than `min_time`.***
