Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. The value of `s_i` is less than `t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i.***
