Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple at index `i` in the list `bus_routes`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will depend on the specific tuple at index `i`. The variables `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`**
