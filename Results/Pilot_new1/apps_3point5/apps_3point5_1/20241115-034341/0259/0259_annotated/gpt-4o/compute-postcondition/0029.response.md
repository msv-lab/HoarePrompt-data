Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is determined by the tuple at index `i`, and since `i` is less than `n`, the calculation is specific to each tuple in the list `bus_routes`. The output state will depend on the values of `s_i` and `t` for each tuple in the list.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `s_i` and `t` for each tuple in the list `bus_routes`**
