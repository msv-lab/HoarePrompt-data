Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times. After the loop executes, min_wait_time will be the minimum wait time calculated for all bus routes, chosen_route will be the route number with the minimum wait time. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and min_wait_time will remain positive infinity, chosen_route will remain -1.**
