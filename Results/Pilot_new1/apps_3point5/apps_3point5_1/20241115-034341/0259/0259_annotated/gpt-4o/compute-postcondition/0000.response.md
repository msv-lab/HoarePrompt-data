Example Answer:
The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. Since this is the initial state and no other variables are affected, the output state is:
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity**
