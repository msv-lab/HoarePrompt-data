According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is positive. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the adjusted state should be: 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
