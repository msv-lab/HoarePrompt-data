According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`**
