Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. The value of `s_i` is less than `t`. The difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`**
