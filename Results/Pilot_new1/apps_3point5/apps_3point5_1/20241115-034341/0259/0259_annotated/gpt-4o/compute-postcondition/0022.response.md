Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This covers all possible scenarios for the calculation of `wait_time` based on the given conditions.***
