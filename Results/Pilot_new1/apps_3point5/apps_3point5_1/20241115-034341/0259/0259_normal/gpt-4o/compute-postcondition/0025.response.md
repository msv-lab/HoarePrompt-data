Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown, so the value of `chosen_route` depends on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `chosen_route` is dependent on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `chosen_route` is dependent on the value of `i`**
