Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route. If the calculated `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to the new `wait_time` value, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. The updated `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions mentioned in the precondition. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. If neither of these conditions are met, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases based on the values of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i` for the bus route `i`.***
