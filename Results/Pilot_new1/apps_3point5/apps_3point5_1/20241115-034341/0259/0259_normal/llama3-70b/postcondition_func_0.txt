The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and the schedule of buses. It calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus based on the input schedule and prints the index of the bus with the minimum waiting time plus 1. If the input values are invalid (negative `n`, `t`, or empty `buses` list), the function does not execute the main logic and no output is provided.
