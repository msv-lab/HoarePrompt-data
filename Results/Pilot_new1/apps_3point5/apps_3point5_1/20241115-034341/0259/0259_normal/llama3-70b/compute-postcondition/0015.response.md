According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `ans` is -1. To ensure the loop executes, the `buses` list must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first element in the list.
State: **`min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first element in the list**
