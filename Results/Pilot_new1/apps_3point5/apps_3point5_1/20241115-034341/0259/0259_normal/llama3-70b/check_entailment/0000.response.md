Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
- It then reads the arrival time and interval for each bus route and stores them in a list of tuples.
- The code calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus based on the input schedule and prints the index of the bus with the minimum waiting time plus 1.
- The code correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output for each case.
- The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
