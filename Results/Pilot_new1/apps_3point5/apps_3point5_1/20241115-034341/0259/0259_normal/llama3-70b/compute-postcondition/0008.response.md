According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of 3 to 100. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split**
