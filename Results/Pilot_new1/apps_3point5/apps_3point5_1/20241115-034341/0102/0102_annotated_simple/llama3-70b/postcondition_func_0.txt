The function takes an integer input `s` between 0 and 99 and returns the string representation of that number in words. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the `teens` list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it constructs the word representation based on the `tens` and `ones` lists. The code accurately handles the conversion of numbers to words within the specified range.
