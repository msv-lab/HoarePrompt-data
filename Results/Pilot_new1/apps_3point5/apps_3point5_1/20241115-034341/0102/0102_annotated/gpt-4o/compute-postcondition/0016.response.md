Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list containing string elements representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list containing string elements representing tens from zero to ninety. The value of `n` is an integer between 10 and 99. If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the corresponding string element from the 'teens' list. If 10 <= n <= 99 and n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string element representing the tens place from the 'tens' list. Otherwise, the function returns a string combining the tens and ones place elements from the 'tens' and 'ones' lists respectively, to represent the number `n` in words. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including the edge cases when n is a multiple of 10 and when it is not, ensuring the accurate representation of the number in words.***
