Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing the English names of numbers from zero to nine, tens is a list containing the English names of tens from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 10, the program prints the English name of the number corresponding to s from the ones list. If s is between 10 and 19, the program prints the English name of the number corresponding to s from the teens list. If s is between 20 and 99, the program prints the English representation of s using the ones and tens lists, considering all possible cases and edge cases, including when s is a multiple of 10.***
