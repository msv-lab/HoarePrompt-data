Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values and finds the positions of the minimum and maximum values in the list.
- It then calculates the distances of each position from the ends of the list and determines the maximum distance among them.
- Finally, it prints the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for all given examples.
