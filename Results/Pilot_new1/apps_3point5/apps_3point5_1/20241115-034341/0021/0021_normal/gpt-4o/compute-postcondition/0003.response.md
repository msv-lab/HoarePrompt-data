Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n. Since `n` is the maximum value in list `a`, `max_pos` will hold the index of `n` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list a, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list a, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a**
