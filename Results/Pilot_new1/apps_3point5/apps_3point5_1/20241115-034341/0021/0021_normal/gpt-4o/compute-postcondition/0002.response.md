Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the value 1 in list `a`. The list `a` contains n distinct integers, and each integer is between 1 and n. Therefore, the index of 1 in list `a` will be the position of 1 in the list. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
