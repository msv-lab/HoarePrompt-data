Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, considering the positions of other elements in between. The function prints the maximum distance calculated. The function assumes `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. However, the function lacks explicit return values and does not handle cases where the input list does not contain 1 or `n`. **
