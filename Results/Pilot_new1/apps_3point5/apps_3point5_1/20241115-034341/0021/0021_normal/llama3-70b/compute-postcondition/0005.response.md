Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of n in list `a`, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance between indices of 1 and n in list `a`, `min_dist` is the minimum of the absolute difference between pos1 and posn minus 1 or n - 2**
