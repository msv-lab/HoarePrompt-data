Example Answer:
The maximum distance between the indices of 1 and n in list `a` is calculated by finding the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracting 1, and then taking the maximum with `n - 2`. The value of `pos1` and `posn` are already known, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the maximum distance is calculated and stored in `max_dist`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of n in list `a`, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance between indices of 1 and n in list `a`.**
