Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `min_dist` is the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`, and the code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`**
