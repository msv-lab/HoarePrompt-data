Example Answer:
The index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in list `a` is stored in `pos1`. The value of `n` is not affected, and `a` is a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
