Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in a list `a`. The initial value of `n` is an input integer, and after execution, `a` contains the list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
