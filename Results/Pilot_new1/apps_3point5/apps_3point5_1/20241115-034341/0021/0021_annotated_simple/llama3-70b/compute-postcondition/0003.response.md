Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a` using the `index()` method. The value of `n` is the input integer, and the value of `a` is a list of integers. If `n` is not found in list `a`, a `ValueError` will be raised. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`**
