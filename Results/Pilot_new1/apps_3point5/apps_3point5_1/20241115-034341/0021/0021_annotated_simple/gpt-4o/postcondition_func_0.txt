The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the minimum and maximum values in the list from the edges (0 and `n-1`). The function prints the maximum distance as the output. The function assumes `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
