Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking input, finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculating the distances between these elements and the ends of the array, and then finding the maximum distance possible. The logic of swapping the minimum and maximum elements to maximize the distance is implemented correctly. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
