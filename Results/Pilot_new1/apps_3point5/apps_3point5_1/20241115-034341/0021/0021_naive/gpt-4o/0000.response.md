Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding the positions of 1 and n in the array and calculating the distances from the beginning and end of the array. It then takes the maximum of these distances and prints it as the output. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
