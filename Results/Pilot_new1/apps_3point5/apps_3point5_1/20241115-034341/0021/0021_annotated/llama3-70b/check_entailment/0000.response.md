Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the input, finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements (1 and n), calculates the maximum and minimum distances between them, and then prints the maximum possible distance after one swap. The code handles the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, as well as cases where a swap is needed to maximize the distance. The annotations provide a clear summary of the code's functionality and do not suggest any cases where the code would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.
