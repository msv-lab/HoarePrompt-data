Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` subtracted by 1, and `n - 2`. Since `pos1` is 0 and `posn` is `n-1`, the absolute difference is `n-1`. Therefore, `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between `n-1 - 1` and `n - 2`, which simplifies to `max(n-2, n-2)`, resulting in `n-2`. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1, max_dist is n-2**
