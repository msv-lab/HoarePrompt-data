Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and a list a of n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, subtracting 1, and the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, subtracting 1. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the calculated maximum distance and n - 1 minus the minimum distance. The function assumes n is an integer between 2 and 100, and the list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.**
