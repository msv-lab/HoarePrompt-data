Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The initial values are `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. After execution, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`**
