Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not always follow the problem description. 

An example where the code does not work as expected is:
Input:
4
2 1 4 3

Expected Output:
3

Explanation: In this case, the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (4) are already at the maximum possible distance of 3. However, the code will output 2 instead.

The annotations did not provide this specific example, but upon analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code does not cover all potential cases as required.
