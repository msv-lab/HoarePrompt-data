Output State: **If n is divisible by x then the loop doesn't execute, n remains the same, k is an integer between 0 and 8, and x is a value depending on the value of k. If n is not divisible by x, n is a positive integer incremented by a value to make it divisible by x, k is an integer between 0 and 8, and x is updated to satisfy the condition n % x != 0**
