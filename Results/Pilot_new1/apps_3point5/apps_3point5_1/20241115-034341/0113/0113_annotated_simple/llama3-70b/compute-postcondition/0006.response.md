Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `n` will be the previous value of `n` + 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `x` is updated to satisfy the condition `n % x != 0`, which means that `x` will be the smallest number greater than 1 that does not divide `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 3, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is updated to satisfy the condition `n % x != 0`**
