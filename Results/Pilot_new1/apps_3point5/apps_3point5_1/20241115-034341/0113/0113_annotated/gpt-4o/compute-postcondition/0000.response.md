Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer, the value of `multiplier` will be `10` if `k` is `1`, `100` if `k` is `2`, and so on. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k**
