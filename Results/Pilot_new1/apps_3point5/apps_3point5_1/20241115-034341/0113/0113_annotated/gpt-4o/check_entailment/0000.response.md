Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the k-rounding of n as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the result of n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where `multiplier` is equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, which aligns with the definition of k-rounding. The program handles all potential cases where k can be from 0 to 8 and n is a positive integer up to 10^9. The annotations also describe the same calculation that the code performs, confirming that the code is correctly implementing the problem requirements. Overall, the code and annotations are consistent with the problem description, and there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected.
