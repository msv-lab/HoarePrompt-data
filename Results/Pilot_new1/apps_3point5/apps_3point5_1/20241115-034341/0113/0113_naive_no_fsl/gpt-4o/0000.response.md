Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n as described in the problem statement. It calculates the multiplier needed to add the required number of zeros to the end of n, then finds the least common multiple of n and the multiplier to get the k-rounding value. The program uses integer division to handle large numbers efficiently. The logic is correct and the program produces the expected output for all given examples.
