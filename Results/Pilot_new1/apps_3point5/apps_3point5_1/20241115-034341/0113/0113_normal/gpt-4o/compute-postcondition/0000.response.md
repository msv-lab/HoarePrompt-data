Example Answer:
`multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` can be any integer value from 0 to 8. The value of `k` determines the value of `multiplier`. Therefore, the Output State is: **`multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`.**
Output State: **`multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`**
