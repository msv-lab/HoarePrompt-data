Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The input values are positive integers, so `n` and `k` will hold positive integer values within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
