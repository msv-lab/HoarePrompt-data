Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the value of `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and then increments `n` until it is divisible by `x`. Finally, it prints the value of `n`. The function essentially calculates and outputs the result of 10^k * n.**
