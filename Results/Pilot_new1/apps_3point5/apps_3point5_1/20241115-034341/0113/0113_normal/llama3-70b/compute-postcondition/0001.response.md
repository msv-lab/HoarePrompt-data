Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The value of `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`**
