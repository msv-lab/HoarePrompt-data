Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. The variables `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is an integer with the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` is an integer, `i` is an integer.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is an integer with the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` is an integer, `i` is an integer**
