Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, and `i` is an integer. The square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, so the value of `max_divisor` is updated accordingly. 
Output State: **max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and gcd // i. i is an integer. The square of i is not equal to gcd**
