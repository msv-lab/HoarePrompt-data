Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and the value at index 3 of list `A`. The previous value of `gcd` and the value at index 3 of list `A` are not provided, so the output state is: N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 3.
Output State: **N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 3**
