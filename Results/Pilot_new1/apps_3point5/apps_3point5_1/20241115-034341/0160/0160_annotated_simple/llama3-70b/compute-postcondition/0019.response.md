According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)). At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` and `gcd` are integers, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer that ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)). 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be considered. Since `i` ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)), the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`, and the loop should execute again. 

State: **max_divisor and gcd are integers, gcd is greater than or equal to 1, i is an integer that ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
