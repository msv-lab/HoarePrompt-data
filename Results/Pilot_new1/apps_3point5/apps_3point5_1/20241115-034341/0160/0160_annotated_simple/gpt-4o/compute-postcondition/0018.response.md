Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` and calculates all the divisors of `x`. If `x` is a perfect square, the square root of `x` is added to the divisors set only once. The program then returns the set of divisors of `x` sorted in descending order. If `x` is not greater than 0, the function returns an empty set. **
