Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers.
2. The `func_2` function correctly calculates all the divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in descending order.
3. The program uses these two functions to determine the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the given sequence after the operations.
4. The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately and there are no edge cases identified where the program fails to produce the correct output.
