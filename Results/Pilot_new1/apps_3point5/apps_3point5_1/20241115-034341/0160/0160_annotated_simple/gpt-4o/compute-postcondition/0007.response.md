Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 2, after execution, the set `divisors` will contain 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer equal to 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer equal to 2**
