Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set that contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement. If x % i == 0, `divisors` will have `i` and x // i added to it. `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer equal to 1. The postcondition covers the case where x is divisible by i, updating the divisors set accordingly with both divisors and ensuring the initial conditions are maintained.***
