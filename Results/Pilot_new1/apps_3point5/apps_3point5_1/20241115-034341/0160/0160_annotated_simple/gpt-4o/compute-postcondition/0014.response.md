According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing updated divisors based on the conditions mentioned. `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing updated divisors, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4**
