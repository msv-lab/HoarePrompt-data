Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of N and K are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
