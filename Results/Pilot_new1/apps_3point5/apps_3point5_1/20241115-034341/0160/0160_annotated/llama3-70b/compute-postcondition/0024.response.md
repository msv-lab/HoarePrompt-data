According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `gcd` and `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. If `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
