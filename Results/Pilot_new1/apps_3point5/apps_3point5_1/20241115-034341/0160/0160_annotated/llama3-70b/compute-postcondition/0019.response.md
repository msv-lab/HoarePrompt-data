According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, `max_divisor` needs to be updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment for the next iteration.

State: **`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1**
