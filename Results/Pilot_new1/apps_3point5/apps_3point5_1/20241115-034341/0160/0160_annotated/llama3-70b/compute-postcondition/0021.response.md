Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `gcd` is a positive number and `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `max_divisor` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
