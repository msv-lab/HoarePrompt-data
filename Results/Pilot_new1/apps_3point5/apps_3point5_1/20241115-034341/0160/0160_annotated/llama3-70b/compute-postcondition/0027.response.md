Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. This ensures that `max_divisor` captures the largest divisor of `gcd` excluding the square root of `gcd`.***
