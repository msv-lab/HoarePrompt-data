Output State: **After the loop executes, `gcd` will be the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, `N` and `K` will retain their initial values. If `N` is less than 2, the loop will not execute and `gcd` will remain as the first element of list `A`. `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`.**
