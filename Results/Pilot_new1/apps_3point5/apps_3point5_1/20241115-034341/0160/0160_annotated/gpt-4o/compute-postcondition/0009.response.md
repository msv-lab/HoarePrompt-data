Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1 and additional divisors of x, x is a positive integer, i is 2, math module is imported. If x is divisible by 2, divisors set is updated to include i and x // i. The postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios for the given program fragment.***
