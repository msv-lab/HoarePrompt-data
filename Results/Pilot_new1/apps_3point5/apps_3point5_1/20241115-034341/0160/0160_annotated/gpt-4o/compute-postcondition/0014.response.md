According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1, 3, and additional divisors of x, x is a positive integer, i is 4, math module is imported. If x is divisible by 3, then 3 and x divided by 3 are added to divisors. This covers all cases where x is a multiple of 3 and ensures that the divisors set contains all relevant divisors of x.**
