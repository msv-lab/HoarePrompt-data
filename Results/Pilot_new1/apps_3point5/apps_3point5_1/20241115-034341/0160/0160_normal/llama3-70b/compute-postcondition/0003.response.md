According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, so it needs to be adjusted to N is at least 2, gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, and i is now 1.
State: **A is a list of N integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, i is 1**
