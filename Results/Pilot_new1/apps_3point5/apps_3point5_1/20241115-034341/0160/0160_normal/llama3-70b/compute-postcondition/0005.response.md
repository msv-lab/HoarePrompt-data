According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `K` is a non-negative integer, `gcd` is the updated greatest common divisor, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **A is a list of N integers, N is an integer, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor, and i is 2**
