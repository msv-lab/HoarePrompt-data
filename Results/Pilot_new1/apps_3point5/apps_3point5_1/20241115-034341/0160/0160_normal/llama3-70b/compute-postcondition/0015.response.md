Postcondition: ***gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, A is a list of N integers where N is at least 2, K is a non-negative integer, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) is at least 1, i is 1, max_divisor is assigned the value of gcd, the remainder of gcd divided by i is 0, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and i. The square of i is not equal to gcd***
