Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `N` and `K` from input, followed by a list `A` of `N` integers, which aligns with the problem description.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of all elements in `A` and then finds the maximum divisor of `gcd` up to the square root of `gcd`.
- The function prints the maximum divisor as the output, which matches the expected output in the problem description.
- The code handles the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the range of `N`, `A_i`, and `K`.
- The output hints also agree with the code, providing a clear explanation of how the code operates and what the output represents.
