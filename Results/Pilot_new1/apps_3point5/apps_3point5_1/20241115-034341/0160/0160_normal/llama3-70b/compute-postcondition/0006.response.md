Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated by finding the greatest common divisor between the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`. The previous value of `gcd` is unknown, but `i` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list of N integers, N is an integer, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor, and i is 2.
Output State: **A is a list of N integers, N is an integer, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor, and i is 2**
