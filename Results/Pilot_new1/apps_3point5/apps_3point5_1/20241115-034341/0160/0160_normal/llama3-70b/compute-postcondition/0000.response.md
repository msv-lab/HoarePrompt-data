Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values based on the input split. The values of N and K are constrained within the given ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list of N integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, and K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **A is a list of N integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, and K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
