Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x` where 2 <= x <= 500. It finds all the divisors of `x` and returns them in a sorted list in descending order. The function correctly iterates through the range from 1 to the square root of `x`, adding divisors to a set. However, the annotation does not mention handling cases where `x` is less than 1, in which case the function would return an empty list. Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the function handles the case where `x` is a perfect square, where the same divisor might be added twice.**
