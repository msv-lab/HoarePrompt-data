According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `x`, and `divisors` are in the specified ranges and conditions. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, the next value for `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: *N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is an integer such that x >= 1 and the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) has at least one element, divisors is a set containing all divisors found during the loop execution. If x is divisible by i, then divisors contains the newly added divisors i and x // i, i is incremented by 1.
