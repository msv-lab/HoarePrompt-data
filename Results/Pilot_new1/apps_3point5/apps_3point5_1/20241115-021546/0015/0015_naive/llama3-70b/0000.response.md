Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is 0, then the sequence will be a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ... and if a is equal to b, then b will appear in the sequence. So, the program correctly outputs "YES" in this case.
2. If c is not 0, then the sequence will be a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ... and if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then b will appear in the sequence. So, the program correctly outputs "YES" in this case as well.
3. If neither of the above conditions are met, then b will not appear in the sequence and the program correctly outputs "NO".
