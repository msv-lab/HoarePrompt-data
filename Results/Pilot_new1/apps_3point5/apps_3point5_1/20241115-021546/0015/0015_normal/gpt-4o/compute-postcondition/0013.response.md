Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.***
