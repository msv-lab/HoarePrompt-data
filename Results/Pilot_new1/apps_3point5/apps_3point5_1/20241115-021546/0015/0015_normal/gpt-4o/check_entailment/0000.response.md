Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The code correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks various conditions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as described in the problem statement. 
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES', which covers the case when Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO', which covers the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0.
- If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, it prints 'YES', which covers the case where Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence with the given difference between elements.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO', which covers the case where Vasya's favorite number does not appear in the sequence with the given difference between elements.

The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code covers the edge cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. Therefore, based on the code logic and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
