Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input.
- If `c` is 0, it correctly checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise prints 'NO'.
- If `c` is not 0, it correctly checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
- The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
