Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If none of the above conditions are met, 'NO' is printed.***
