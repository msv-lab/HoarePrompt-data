Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers and `c` is not equal to 0, ensuring that the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the divisibility and non-negativity conditions of (b - a) by `c`.***
