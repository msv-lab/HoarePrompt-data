The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, and based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it either prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input.
