Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program evaluates the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0). If the condition is true, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program covers all scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, ensuring that the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions.***
