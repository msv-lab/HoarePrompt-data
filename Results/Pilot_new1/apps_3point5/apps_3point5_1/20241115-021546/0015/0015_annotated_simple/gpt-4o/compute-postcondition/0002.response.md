Example Answer: 
The code prints 'YES' to the console. The values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the code, and they remain the same as the initial state where `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, and `b` is equal to `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `b` is equal to `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `b` is equal to `a`**
