Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, where `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c < 0) is true, 'NO' is printed. If ((b - a) % c != 0) is true, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all possible scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` meet the specified criteria and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.***
