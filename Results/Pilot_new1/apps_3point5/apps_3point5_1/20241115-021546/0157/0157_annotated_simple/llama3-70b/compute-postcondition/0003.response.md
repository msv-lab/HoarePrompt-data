Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is between 1 and 1000, the value of `b` is unknown, and the value of `c` is unknown. Therefore, `min_lemon` could be any value depending on the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` could be any value depending on the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c**.
