Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the ratio of 1:2:4 is maintained by finding the minimum of the available lemons, apples (divided by 2), and pears (divided by 4). The program then calculates the total by multiplying the minimum value by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. This logic covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
