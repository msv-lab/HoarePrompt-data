Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is a positive integer, the value of `b` is an integer, and the value of `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. Therefore, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and one-fourth of `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
