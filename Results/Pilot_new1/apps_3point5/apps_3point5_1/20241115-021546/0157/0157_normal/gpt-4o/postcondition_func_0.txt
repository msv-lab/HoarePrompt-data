The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. After that, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, as it relies on user input.
