Example Answer:
The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The values of `b` and `c` are input integers. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be the minimum of `a`, half of `b`, and one-fourth of `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
