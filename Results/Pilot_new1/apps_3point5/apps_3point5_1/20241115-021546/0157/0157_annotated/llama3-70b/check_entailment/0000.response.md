Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the ratios of a, b, and c, and then prints the total number of lemons that can be obtained by adding the minimum number of lemons required for each ingredient. The code also handles the case where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote, in which case it correctly outputs 0. The annotations provide a clear summary of what the code does and the assumptions it makes, which align with the problem description. Since there are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected, the correctness is deemed to be True.
