Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` and `c` are input integers, the value of `min_lemon` will depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The output state is: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
