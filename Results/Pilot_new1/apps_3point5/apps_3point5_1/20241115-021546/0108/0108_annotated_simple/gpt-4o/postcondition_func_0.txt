The function reads a string `s` from the user input and compares it with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. It prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if `s` contains all the characters of the target string in order. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function handles cases where `s` is empty, `target` is empty, or when the characters in `s` do not match the characters in `target`.
