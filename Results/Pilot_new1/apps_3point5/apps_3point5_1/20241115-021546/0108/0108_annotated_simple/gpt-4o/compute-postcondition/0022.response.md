Postcondition: ***If `s` is empty or `target` is empty, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `s` is not empty and `target` is not empty, then `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than the length of `target`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `i` is increased by 1. If `j` equals the length of `target`, the code snippet prints `target`. Otherwise, it prints -1. This ensures that the program handles all cases where `s` and `target` are empty, `s` and `target` are not empty, and the condition for matching elements in `s` and `target` is met or not.***
