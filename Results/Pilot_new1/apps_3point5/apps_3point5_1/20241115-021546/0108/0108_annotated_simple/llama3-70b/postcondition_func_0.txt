The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character and the next character in alphabetical order to the result string `res`. If the length of `res` reaches 26 characters (representing all letters of the alphabet), it prints `res`. If `s` does not contain all alphabet characters, it prints -1. The function does not return any specific value.
