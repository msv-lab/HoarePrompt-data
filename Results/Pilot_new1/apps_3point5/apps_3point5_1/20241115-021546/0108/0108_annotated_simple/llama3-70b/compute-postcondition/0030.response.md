Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once. The variable `res` contains the added character `char`. After execution, the updated state is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`**
