Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The value of `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once, `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once, `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`**
