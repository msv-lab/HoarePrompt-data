According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be the character that was replaced in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once, `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`**
