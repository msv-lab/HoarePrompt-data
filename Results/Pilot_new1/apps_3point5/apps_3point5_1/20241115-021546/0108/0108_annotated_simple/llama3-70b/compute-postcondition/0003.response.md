According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet` string. Therefore, the loop will always execute as the `alphabet` string is fixed. Before the loop starts, the `res` is an empty string, and `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. Since the loop will iterate over each character in `alphabet`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to set `char` to the first character in the `alphabet` string.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
