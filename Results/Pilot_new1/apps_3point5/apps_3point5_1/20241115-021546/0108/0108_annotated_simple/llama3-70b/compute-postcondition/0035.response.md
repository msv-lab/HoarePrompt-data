Output State: **If 'char' is present in 's' at least once, 's' is updated with 'char' replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; 'char' is the character that was replaced in 's'; 'res' contains the added character 'char'. If 'char' is not present in 's' at all, the loop does not execute and 's', 'char', and 'res' remain unchanged.**
