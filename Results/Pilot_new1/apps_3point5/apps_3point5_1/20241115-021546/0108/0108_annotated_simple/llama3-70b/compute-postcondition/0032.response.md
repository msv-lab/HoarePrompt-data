Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, so the value of `char` is added to `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`**
