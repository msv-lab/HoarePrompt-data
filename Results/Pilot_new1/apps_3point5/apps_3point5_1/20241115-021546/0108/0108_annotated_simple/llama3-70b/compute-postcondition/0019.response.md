Example Answer: 
The `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. Since `char` is present in `s`, it will be replaced with the next character. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`.
Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`**
