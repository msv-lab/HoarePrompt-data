Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the English alphabet characters and for each character, it checks if it is present in the input string. If it is present, it appends that character to the result string and replaces it in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. If the character is not present, it moves to the next character in the alphabet. After iterating through all characters, if the length of the result string is 26 (length of the English alphabet), it prints the result string, otherwise, it prints -1. This logic ensures that the output string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the described problem.
