Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in a string `s` and iterates through the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`. If it is, it replaces that character with the next character in alphabetical order and continues this process until the entire alphabet is covered or until the character is not present in the input string. If at the end, the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (the length of the English alphabet), it prints the resulting string, otherwise it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that the resulting string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. It handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by checking the length of the resulting string. The logic of replacing characters with the next character in alphabetical order is correctly implemented. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
