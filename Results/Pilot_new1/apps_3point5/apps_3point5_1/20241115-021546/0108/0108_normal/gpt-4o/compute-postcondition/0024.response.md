Functionality: ** The function reads a string `s` from the user and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. If all characters in `s` are found in order in `target`, it prints the target string. If `s` contains characters not in `target` or is longer than `target`, it prints -1. The function operates on a string `s` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. **
