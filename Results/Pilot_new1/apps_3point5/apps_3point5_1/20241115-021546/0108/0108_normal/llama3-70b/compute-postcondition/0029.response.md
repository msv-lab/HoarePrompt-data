Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`, which contains all small English letters in order. The value of `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`, and `char` is in `s`. Therefore, after execution, the updated `res` string will contain all small English letters in order along with the newly added `char`.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added `char`**
