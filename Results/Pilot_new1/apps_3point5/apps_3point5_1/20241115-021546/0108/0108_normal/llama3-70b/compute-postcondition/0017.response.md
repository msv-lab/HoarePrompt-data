According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order, and `char` is the next or last small English letter in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be in the string `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order, `char` is the next or last small English letter in the alphabet**
