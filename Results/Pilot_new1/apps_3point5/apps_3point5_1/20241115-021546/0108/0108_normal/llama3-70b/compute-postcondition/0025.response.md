According to the code, the loop can execute until the end of the alphabet. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the last small English letter in the alphabet. If the loop terminates early, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point, `char` is the next small letter after the last one in `res`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to the next small English letter after the last one in `res`.
State: **If the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`.
