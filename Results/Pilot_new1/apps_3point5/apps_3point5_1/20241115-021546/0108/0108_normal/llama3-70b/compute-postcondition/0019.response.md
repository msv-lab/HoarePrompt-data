Example Answer:
The `char` in `res` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, and only the first occurrence is replaced. The previous state of `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of `char`. After execution, `char` is replaced with the character that comes after it, and the rest of the string remains the same.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of `char` where `char` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence**
