According to the code, the loop will execute until all small English letters are covered in `res`. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, and `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`. To execute one more time, `char` should be appended to `res` and become the last small English letter in `res`.
State: **If the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`, `res` should be adjusted to include `char` as the last letter.**
