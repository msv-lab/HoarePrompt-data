Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The previous state of `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order. After the replacement, the new `res` will contain all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence**
