Example Answer:
The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. Since no operation is performed on the string `s`, the state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string**
