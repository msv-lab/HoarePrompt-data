According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `char` variable should be adjusted to be the last character in the ASCII sequence of small English letters or the character that comes after the current `char` in the sequence. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence, `char` is the last character in the ASCII sequence of small English letters or the character that comes after the current `char` in the sequence**
