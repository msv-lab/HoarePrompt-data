According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all small English letters in order and `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res` and `char` is in `s`**
