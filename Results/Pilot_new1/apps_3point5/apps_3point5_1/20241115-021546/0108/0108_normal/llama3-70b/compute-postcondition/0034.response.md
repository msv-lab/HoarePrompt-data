According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence. For the loop to execute one more time, the newly added character in `res` should be replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence**
