Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Therefore, `char` is replaced with the character obtained by incrementing its ASCII value by 1. The output state will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order, `char` is the next or last small English letter in the alphabet**
