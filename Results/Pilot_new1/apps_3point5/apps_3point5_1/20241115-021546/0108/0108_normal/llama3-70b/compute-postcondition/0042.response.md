Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all small English letters in order, `res` will contain all small English letters in order, `char` will be the last small English letter in the alphabet, and the value of `res` is printed. If `s` does not contain all small English letters in order, the loop will terminate early, `res` will contain all small English letters up to the point where the loop terminated, and `char` will be the last small English letter that was successfully processed before the loop terminated. In both cases, the length of `res` is either 26 or less, and the corresponding message is printed.***
