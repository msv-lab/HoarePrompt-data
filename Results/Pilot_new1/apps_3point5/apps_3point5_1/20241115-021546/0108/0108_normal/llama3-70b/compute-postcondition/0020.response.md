According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of `char` where `char` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `char` that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence should be added to `res`.
State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence**
