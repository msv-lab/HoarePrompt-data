Example Answer:
The new character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, and the newly added character is replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence**
