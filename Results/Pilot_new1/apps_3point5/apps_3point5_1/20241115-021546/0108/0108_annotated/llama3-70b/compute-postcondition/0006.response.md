According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is the updated string after adding the current character. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the current `char` is in `s`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character, and the current `char` is in `s`**
