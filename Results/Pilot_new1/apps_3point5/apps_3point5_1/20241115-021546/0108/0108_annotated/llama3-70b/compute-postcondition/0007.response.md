Example Answer: 
`res` is updated by adding the current character `char`, so the value of `char` is added to the end of `res`. The updated `res` now includes the current `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character, and the current `char` is in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character, and the current `char` is in `s`**
