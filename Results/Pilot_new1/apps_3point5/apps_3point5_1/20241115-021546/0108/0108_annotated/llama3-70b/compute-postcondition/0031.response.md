According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables 'char' and 's'. If 'char' is in 's', the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, so 'char' must be in 's' for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' is added to 'res'.**
