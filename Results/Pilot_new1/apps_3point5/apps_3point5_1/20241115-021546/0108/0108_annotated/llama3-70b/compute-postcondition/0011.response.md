Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`. The variable `alphabet` is not affected. The variable `res` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character**
