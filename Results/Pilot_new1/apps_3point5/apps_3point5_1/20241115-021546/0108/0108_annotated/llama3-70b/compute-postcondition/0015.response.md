Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. The `char` variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. The `res` variable contains all characters iterated over in `s` so far. Therefore, the Output State is: s contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', res is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in s.
Output State: **s contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', res is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in s**
