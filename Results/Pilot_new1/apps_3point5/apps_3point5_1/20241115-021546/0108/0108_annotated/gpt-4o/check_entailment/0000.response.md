Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads a string `s` and compares it character by character with the target string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. If `s` contains all the characters of `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` in order, it prints `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles the scenario where it is impossible to obtain `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` as a subsequence from the given string `s`. The annotations also accurately describe the logic of the code and the conditions under which it will print either `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` or -1. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all cases.
