Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and compares it character by character with the predefined string `target` which consists of lowercase English letters. If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, it prints `target`. If there is no match or if the loop ends before `j` reaches the length of `target`, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and has no return value.**
