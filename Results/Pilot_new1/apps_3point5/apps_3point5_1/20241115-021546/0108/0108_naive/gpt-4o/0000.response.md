Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target alphabet string to check if the input string can be transformed into a subsequence of the target alphabet. It increments the index of the target alphabet string only when a match is found in the input string. If the program reaches the end of the target alphabet string, it means the input string can be transformed into the target alphabet subsequence and it prints the target alphabet string. Otherwise, it prints -1 indicating that it is impossible to transform the input string into the target alphabet subsequence. The program covers all potential cases and works as described in the problem statement.
