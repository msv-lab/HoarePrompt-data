Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the cubes provided. However, the function does not handle the case where the number cannot be formed using the cubes, resulting in an infinite loop in the `func_1` function. 
- For example, if the cubes provided are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1], and [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the function will keep incrementing `x` without ever reaching a point where it can't form the next number, leading to an incorrect output. 
- The output hints do not provide an example where the code fails, but based on the code logic, it is clear that the code does not handle the case where the number cannot be formed using the given cubes.
