Example Answer:
The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that cube `i` has been marked as used. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is initialized as `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.
Output State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is initialized as `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
