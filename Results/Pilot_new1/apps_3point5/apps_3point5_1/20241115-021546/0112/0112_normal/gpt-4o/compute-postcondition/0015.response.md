According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, at least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, `found` is True, and the loop is broken. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `i` is less than `n+1`, `found` is True, and the loop is not broken.**
