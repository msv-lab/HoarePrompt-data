Example Answer:
`found` is initialized as `False`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: All cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is initialized as `False`.
Output State: **All cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is initialized as `False`**
