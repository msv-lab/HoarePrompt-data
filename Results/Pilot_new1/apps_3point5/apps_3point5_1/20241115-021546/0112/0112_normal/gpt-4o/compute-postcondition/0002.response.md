According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, all cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list.
State: **All cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
