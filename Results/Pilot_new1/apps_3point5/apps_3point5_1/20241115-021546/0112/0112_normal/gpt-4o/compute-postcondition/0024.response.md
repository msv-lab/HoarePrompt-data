Postcondition: ***At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True. If `n` is greater than 0 and the loop or if statement is broken out after the if condition is met, then the program returns False. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False.***
