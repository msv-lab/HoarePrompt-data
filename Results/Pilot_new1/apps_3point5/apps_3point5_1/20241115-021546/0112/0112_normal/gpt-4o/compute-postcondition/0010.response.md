According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, at least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `i` is less than `n`**
