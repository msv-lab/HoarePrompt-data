According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more digits in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, at least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, and `found` is True. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 2 digits, and the `digit` should be the second digit in the list.

State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list, `found` is True**
