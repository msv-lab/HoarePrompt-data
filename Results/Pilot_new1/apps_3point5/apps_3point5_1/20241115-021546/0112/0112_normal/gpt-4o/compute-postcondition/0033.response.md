Functionality: The function `can_form_number` takes a positive integer `num` representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers representing the digits on each face of the cube. The function iterates through the digits of `num`, checks if each digit can be formed by any of the cube faces, and marks the corresponding cube as used. If a digit cannot be formed by any cube face, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed by the cube faces, the function returns True. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.
