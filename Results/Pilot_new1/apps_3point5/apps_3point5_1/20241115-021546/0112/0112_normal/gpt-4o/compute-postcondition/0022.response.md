Postcondition: ***At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`. The loop or if statement is broken out of after the if condition is met. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False.***
