Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a single number, and prints the resulting maximum number. If `n` is 0, no cubes are processed, and the function does not produce any output.**
