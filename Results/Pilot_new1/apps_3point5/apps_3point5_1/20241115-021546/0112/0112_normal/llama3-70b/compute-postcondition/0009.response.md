According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of cubes in the list. If there are at least (n+3) cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of (n+2) lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube and any additional digits added from the cubes after updating. 

To execute the loop one more time, the number of cubes in the list should be at least (n+3). Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of (n+3) lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube and any additional digits added from the cubes after updating**
