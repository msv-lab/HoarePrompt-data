The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a list of 6 integers, representing a cube. The cube will have a total of n faces, where n is an integer between 1 and 3. Each face of the cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a list of integers representing a cube with n faces, where each face is represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9.
