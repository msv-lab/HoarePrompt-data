Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the first cube of the list and adds each digit as a string to the set `digits`. Since the value of `cube` is the first cube in the list, the set `digits` will be updated with the individual digits of that cube. The set `digits` will now contain the individual digits of the first cube.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least one cube, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
