Example Answer: 
The code snippet creates a list of lists called `cubes` by taking input for `n` number of times. Each input is split into integers and added to the list. Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, the number of inputs and lists in `cubes` will vary accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists based on the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists based on the input values**
