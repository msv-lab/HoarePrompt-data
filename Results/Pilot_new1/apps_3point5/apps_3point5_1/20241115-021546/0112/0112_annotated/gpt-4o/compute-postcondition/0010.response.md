According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` after the break statement. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. So, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where the cube at index i is marked as True if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is True after the execution of the if statement, `i` is incremented by 1**
