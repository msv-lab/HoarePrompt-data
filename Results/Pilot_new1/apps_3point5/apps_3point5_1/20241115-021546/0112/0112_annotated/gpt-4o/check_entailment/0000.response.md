Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the cubes, but it does not take into account the restriction that digit 6 cannot be formed from digit 9 and vice versa. This means that the code does not handle this specific edge case mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
