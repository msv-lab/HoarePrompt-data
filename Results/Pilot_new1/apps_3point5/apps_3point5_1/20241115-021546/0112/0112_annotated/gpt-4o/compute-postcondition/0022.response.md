Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0 and there exists at least one cube where digit is present. After the loop executes, used_cubes will have True values at indices where the condition is met, found will be True, and the loop will terminate. If there is no cube where digit is present or n is 0, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values.***
