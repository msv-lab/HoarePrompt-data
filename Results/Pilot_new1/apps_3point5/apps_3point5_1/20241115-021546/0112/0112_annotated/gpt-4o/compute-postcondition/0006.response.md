Example Answer: 
`used_cubes[i]` is set to True, indicating that the cube at index i has been used. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the cube at index i marked as True, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the cube at index i marked as True, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is False**
