Example Answer: 
Each cube in cube_faces is represented by a list of 6 integers. The list used_cubes is initialized with n elements, each set to False. Therefore, after execution, each cube in cube_faces is not used.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube; used_cubes is a list of n elements, each set to False**
