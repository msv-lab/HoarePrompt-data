Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string. Since the value of `num` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values in the list `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube**
