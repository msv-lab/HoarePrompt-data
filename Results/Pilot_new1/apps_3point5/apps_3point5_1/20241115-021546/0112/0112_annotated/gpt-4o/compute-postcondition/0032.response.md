The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, and `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each number on a face is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). 

After executing the function body, the program will check if there exists at least one cube where a specific digit is present. If this condition is met, the function will return True. If there is no cube where the digit is present or n is 0, the function will return False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if there is at least one cube where a specific digit is present and return True in that case. If no cube contains the digit or if n is 0, the function will return False.
