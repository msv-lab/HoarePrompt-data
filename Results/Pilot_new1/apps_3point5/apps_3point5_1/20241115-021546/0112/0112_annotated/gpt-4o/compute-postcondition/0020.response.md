According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where the cube at index i is marked as True if not used_cubes[i], `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 2 again, as the loop will execute one more time.
- If not `used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` needs to be set to True, and `found` needs to be set to True.
- All other variables retain their initial values.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where the cube at index i is marked as True if not used_cubes[i], `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 4**
