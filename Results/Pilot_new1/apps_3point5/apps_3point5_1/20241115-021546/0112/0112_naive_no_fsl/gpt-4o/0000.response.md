Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of cubes and the digits on each face of the cubes.
2. The program correctly checks if Masha can form a number from 1 to x using the given cubes by iterating through each digit and checking if it can be formed using the available cube faces.
3. The program incrementally checks the maximum number x that Masha can form and returns the correct output.
4. The program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible numbers that Masha can form, ensuring that the maximum number x is calculated accurately.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided, and it works correctly for all potential cases.
