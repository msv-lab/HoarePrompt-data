Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, and each element is initialized to `False`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with an unknown length.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with an unknown length**
