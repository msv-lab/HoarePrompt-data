Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting each character to an element in a list. The value of `num` is unknown, so the output state is: `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`**
