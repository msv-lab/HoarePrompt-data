According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, the `digits` list has at least one digit, so it is already in a valid state. However, to ensure the loop executes, `digit` needs to be the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list needs to have at least one element which is `False`, and `found` needs to remain False.
State: **`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `False`, `found` is False, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
