Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` with the string representation of each digit in the cubes list. Since the cubes list contains integers read from the input, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representation of each digit in the input cubes. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` contains 1 to 2 lists of integers read from the input, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 2 lists of integers read from the input; `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes**
