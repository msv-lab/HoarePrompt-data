Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input; `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes. If '0' is in `digits`, then '0' is removed from the set `digits`. If '0' is not in `digits`, `digits` remains unchanged. `max_num` is assigned the integer value of the sorted `digits` set joined together in reverse order. The program prints the `max_num` value.**
