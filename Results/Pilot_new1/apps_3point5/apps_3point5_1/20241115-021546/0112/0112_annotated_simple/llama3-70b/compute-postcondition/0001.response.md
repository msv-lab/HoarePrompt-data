Example Answer:
The code snippet reads `n` lists of integers from the input and stores them in the list `cubes`. Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, the number of lists read and stored in `cubes` will be between 1 and 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input**
