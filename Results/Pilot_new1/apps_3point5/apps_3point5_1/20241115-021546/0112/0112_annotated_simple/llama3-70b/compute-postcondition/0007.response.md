According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If there is at least one list of integers in `cubes`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 2 lists of integers read from the input, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 lists of integers.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` contains 2 lists of integers read from the input, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes**
