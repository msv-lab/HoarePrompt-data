Example Answer:
Each digit in each cube is converted to a string and added to the `digits` set. Since `cubes` contains 2 lists of integers, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes, after execution, the `digits` set will contain all the unique string representations of digits from the cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` contains 2 lists of integers read from the input, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes**
