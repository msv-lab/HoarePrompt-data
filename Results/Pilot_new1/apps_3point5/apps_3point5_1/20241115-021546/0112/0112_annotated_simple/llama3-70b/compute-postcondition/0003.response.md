According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop executes. Since n is an input integer between 1 and 3, and cubes contains 1 to 3 lists of integers, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one list in cubes. Before the loop starts, digits being an empty set does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input; `digits` is an empty set**
