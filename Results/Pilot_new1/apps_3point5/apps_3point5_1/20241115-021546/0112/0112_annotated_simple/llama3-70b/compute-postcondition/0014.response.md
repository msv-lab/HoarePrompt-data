Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input; `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes. If '0' is in `digits`, then the loop executes and the program enters the if condition. After executing `digits.remove('0')`, the '0' digit is removed from the set `digits`. If '0' is not in `digits`, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains unchanged. `max_num` is assigned the integer value of the sorted `digits` set joined together in reverse order.**
