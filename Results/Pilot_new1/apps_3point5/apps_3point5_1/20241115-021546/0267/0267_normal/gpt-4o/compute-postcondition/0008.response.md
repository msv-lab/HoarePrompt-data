According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num` and the range [l, r]. If num is less than or equal to r, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, total_sum, l, r, num are integers. After the execution of the if statement, total_sum is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. So for the loop to be executed one more time, num needs to be the next integer after the last value it had in the previous iteration within the range [l, r] based on the conditions of func_1(num, k). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **total_sum, l, r, num are integers. total_sum is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, where num is the next integer after the last value it had in the previous iteration within the range [l, r] based on the conditions of func_1(num, k)**
