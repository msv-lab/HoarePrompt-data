According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r` and the conditions of `func_1(num, k)`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows: `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next integer after the last value of `num` within the range [l, r] based on the conditions of `func_1(num, k)` needs to be determined. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` will be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there will be no change in the values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` need to be adjusted based on the conditions of `func_1(num, k)` and the next integer within the range [l, r].

State: **Adjust the values of total_sum, l, r, and num based on the conditions of func_1(num, k) to determine the next integer within the range [l, r] that satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.**
