Postcondition: ***total_sum, l, r, num are integers. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true, total_sum is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, where num is the next integer after the last value it had in the previous iteration within the range [l, r] based on the conditions of func_1(num, k). If func_1(num, k) evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of total_sum, l, r, num.***
