According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 3**
