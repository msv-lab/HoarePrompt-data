Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits by calling the `count` function. The `count` function efficiently computes the count of such numbers based on the constraints provided in the problem description. The code handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, such as ensuring that `l` and `r` are within the specified range, and that `k` is between 1 and 10. Additionally, the code correctly applies the modulo operation with `MOD` to the final result before returning it. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
