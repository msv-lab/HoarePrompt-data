Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `dp`, and `i` are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 2**
