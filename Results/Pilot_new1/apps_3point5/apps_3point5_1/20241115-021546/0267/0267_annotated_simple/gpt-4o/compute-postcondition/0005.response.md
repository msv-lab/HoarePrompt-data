According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is the starting point of the range, and `r` is the ending point of the range. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after the current `num`, and this should be within the range of `l` to `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` remains the starting point of the range, `r` remains the ending point of the range, and `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num` within the range of `l` to `r`.**
