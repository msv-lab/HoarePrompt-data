Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k` are integers. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `l` is greater than `r`), then `total_sum` remains 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true for any `num` within the range of `l` to `r`, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` remains the starting point of the range, `r` remains the ending point of the range, and `num` is updated accordingly.**
