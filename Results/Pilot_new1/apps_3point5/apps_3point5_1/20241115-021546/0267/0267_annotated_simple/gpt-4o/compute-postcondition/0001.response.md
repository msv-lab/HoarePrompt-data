According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by l and r. If the range is valid (r is greater than or equal to l), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, total_sum is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to l is the starting point of the range, r is the ending point of the range, and num is equal to l.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is the starting point of the range, `r` is the ending point of the range, `num` is equal to `l`**
