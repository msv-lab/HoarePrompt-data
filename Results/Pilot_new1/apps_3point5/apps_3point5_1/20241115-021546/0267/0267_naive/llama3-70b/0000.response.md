Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `count` function efficiently calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range. The main function then calculates the sum of these counts from $l$ to $r$ and returns the result modulo $998244353$. The logic is sound and the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
