The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer; `k`, a positive integer; and `dp`, a dictionary to store computed values. 

Case 1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0 without altering the state of `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

Case 2: If (n, k) is present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, the function does not modify the state of `n`, `k`, or `dp`. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary dp.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store computed values. The function either returns 0 if `k` is 0 or returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary dp without altering the state of the program variables.
