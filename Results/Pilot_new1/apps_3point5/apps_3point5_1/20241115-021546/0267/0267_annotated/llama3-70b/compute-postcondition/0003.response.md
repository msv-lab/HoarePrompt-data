Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. In all other cases, the program variables remain unchanged, and the function does not alter the state of n, k, or dp. The key (n, k) exists in the dp dictionary***
