According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, so these values do not need to be adjusted. The condition `k` is equal to 0 is not met, so the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is 1. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 1**
