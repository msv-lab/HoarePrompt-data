According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is a positive integer. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`**
