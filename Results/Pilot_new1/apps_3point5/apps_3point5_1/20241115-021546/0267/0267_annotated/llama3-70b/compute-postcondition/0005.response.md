Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, the function does not modify the state of n, k, or dp. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0.***
