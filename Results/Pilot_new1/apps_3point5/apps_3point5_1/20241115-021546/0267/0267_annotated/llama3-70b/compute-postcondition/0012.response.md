According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is a positive integer. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]**
