Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through a range of numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For each number, it calls `func_1(num, k)` and if it returns true, it updates the `total_sum` by adding the number `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The function then returns the final value of `total_sum` after the loop execution. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0.**
