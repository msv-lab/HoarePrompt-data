Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k` are integers. The loop calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` inclusive, where each number `num` is checked with `func_1(num, k)`. If the function returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `num` is set to the new value of `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` does not return true, no changes occur to the variables. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0.**
