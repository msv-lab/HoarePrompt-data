Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. `func_1` correctly checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`, as described in the problem statement. This function is used in `func_2` to determine if a number should be included in the sum.

2. `func_2` iterates through a range of numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive, and for each number, it checks if the number satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits using `func_1`. If the condition is met, the number is added to the `total_sum` modulo `MOD`. The final `total_sum` is returned as the output.

The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, as specified in the problem description. The code handles all potential cases and follows the problem requirements.
