Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `num` is set to the new value of `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` does not return true, no changes occur to the variables.***
