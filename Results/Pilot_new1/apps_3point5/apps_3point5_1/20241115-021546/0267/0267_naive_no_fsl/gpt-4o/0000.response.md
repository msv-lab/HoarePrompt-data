Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$.
2. The program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to check if each number in the range $l$ to $r$ contains at most $k$ different digits and calculate the total sum accordingly.
3. The program iterates through each number in the range $l$ to $r$ and checks if it satisfies the condition of having at most $k$ different digits using `func_1`.
4. The program calculates the total sum of numbers that satisfy the condition and returns the result modulo $998244353$.
5. The output is then printed as the final result.
6. The program logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
