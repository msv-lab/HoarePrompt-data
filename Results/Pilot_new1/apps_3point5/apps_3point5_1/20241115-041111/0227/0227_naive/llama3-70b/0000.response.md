Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It first sorts the input sequence in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted sequence to check if each element is double the previous element. If an element is not double the previous element, it increments the count of variables needed. The program then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
