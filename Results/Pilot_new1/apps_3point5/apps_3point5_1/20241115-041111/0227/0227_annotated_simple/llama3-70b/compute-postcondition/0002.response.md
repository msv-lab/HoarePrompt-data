Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values in list `a` are rearranged in sorted order. The value of `n` does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
