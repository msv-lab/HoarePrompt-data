Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer. If a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i - 1], then m is increased by 1. The variable i is less than n and incremented by 1 after the execution of the program fragment. The postcondition covers the scenario where the condition in the if statement is true, leading to the increment of m, while also ensuring the variables maintain their initial conditions and relationships.***
