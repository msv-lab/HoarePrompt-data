Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, and `x` is an element of list `a`. If the condition is met, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False. The condition (not can_form) is True***
