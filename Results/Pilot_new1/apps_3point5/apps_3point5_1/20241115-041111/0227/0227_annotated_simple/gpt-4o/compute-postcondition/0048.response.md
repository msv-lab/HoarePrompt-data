According to the code, the loop can execute if the assigned list contains at least one element. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`assigned` contains the new element `a[i+1]`, `m` is adjusted based on the condition, `i` is incremented by 1, `can_form` is set to True/False based on the condition, `x` represents the current element in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to False, `x` is the first element in `assigned`**
