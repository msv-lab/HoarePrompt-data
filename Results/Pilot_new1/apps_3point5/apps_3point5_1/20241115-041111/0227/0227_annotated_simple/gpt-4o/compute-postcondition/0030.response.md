Output State: **`assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`, `m` is adjusted based on the condition, `i` is incremented by 1, `can_form` is set to True, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. The difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
