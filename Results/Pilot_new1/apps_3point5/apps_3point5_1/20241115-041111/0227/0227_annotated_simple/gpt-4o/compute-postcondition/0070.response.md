The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and then return the value of `m` after execution.
