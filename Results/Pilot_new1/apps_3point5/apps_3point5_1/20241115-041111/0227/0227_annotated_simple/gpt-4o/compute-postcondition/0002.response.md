Example Answer:
`assigned` is an empty set, and `a` is a list. The code adds the first element of list `a` to the set `assigned`. If `a` is not empty, then the first element is added to `assigned`. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`.
Output State: **`assigned` contains the first element of list `a`**
