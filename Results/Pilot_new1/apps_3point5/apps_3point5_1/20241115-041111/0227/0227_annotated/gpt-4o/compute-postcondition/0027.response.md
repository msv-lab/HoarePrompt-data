According to the code, the loop will execute for each element `x` in the `assigned` list. Therefore, the `assigned` list must not be empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` must exist in the `assigned` list. Since the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` does not exist in the `assigned` list, it implies that `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`. The `can_form` variable being False does not affect the loop execution. The increase in `m` by 1 does not have any impact on the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `assigned` is not empty, `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a`.

State: **`assigned` is not empty, `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a`**
