Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is set to `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a` and the next element in `assigned` is considered, `can_form` is True.
Output State: **`assigned` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a` and the next element in `assigned` is considered, `can_form` is True**
