Postcondition: ***The element at index `i + 2` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` is not empty. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is true, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. This ensures that the element at index `i + 2` in list `a` is included in the set `assigned`, `can_form` remains True, `m` is further incremented by 1, and `assigned` continues to be non-empty.***
