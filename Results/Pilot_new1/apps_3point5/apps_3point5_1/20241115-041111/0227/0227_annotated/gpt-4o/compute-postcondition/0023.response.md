Postcondition: ***If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. After the execution of the if statement, if `can_form` was False, then `m` is increased by 1.***
