Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is a boolean. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
