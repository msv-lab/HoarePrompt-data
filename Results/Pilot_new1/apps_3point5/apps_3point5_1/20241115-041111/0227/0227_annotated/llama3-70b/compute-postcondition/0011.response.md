According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being either 2 or 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers in ascending order, m is either 1 or 2, i is 3**
