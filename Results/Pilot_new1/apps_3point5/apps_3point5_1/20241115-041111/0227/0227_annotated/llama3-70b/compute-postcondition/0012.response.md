Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `m` is either 1 or 2. After execution, the new value of `m` will be either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers in ascending order, m is either 2 or 3, i is 3.
Output State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers in ascending order, m is either 2 or 3, i is 3**
