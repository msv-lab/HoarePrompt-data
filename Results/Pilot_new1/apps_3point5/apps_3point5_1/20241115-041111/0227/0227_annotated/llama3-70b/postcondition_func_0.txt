The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through the list to count how many elements are not twice the previous element. The function then prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1. The function does not return any specific output beyond printing.
