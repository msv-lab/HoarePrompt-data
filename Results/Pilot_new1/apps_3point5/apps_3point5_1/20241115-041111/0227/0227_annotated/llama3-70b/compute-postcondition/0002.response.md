Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `a` are distinct positive integers, and there are `n` elements in the list. After sorting, the list `a` is now in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order**
