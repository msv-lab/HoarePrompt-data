According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. The loop will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
