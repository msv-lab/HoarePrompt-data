Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable that remains False or becomes True based on the condition `a[i] - x in assigned`. `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `assigned` has at least one element. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
