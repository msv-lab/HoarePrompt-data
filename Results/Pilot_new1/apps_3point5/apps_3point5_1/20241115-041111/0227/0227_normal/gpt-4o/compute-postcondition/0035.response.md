Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements from list `a`, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop is broken.***
