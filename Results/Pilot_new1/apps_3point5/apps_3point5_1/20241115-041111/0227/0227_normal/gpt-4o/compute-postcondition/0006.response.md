According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `assigned` is not empty. Since `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, it implies that `a` is not an empty list. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `assigned` should not be empty and `x` should be equal to the first element of list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is equal to the first element of list `a`**
