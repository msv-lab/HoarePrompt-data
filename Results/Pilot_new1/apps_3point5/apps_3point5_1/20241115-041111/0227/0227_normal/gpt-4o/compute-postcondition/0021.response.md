Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least one element from list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False. If `assigned` does not contain at least two elements from list `a`, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.***
