Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1. This condition covers the scenario where the element at index `i` in the list `a` is not double the value of the element at index `i - 1`.***
