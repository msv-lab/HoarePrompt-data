Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and iterates through it to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element. If all elements in `a` are twice the value of the previous element, it sets `m` to 1. The function prints the final count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
