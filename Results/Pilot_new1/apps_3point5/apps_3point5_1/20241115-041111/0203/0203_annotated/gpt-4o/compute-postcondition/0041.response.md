Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, votes is not empty. d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D' excluding the first one that was popped and updated with d_index + n. r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will have the updated indices of employees who voted 'D' excluding the first one, and r_queue will remain the same as before. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue will append the value of r_index + n. Both d_queue and r_queue may have updated indices based on the conditions met during the loop execution***
