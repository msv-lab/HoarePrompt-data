Output State: If n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty, d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D' except for the first one that was popped, r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue appends d_index + n. Otherwise, r_queue appends r_index + n. `r_index` is assigned the index popped from `r_queue`. After the execution of the code, r_queue appends the value of r_index + n.
