Output State: 
- If `n` is greater than 0 and `votes` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. 
- If the loop executes, for each character in `votes`, if the character is 'D', the index `i` will be appended to `d_queue`. If the character is not 'D', the index `i` will be appended to `r_queue`.
- After the loop executes, `d_queue` will contain the indices of employees who voted 'D', and `r_queue` will contain the indices of employees who did not vote 'D'.
- If `n` is 0 or `votes` is empty, the loop will not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty.

Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty, d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D', r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty.**
