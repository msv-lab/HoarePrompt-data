Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the voting procedure described in the problem statement. It creates two queues, `d_queue` for employees who voted 'D' and `r_queue` for employees who did not vote 'D'. The program then simulates the voting process by updating the indices in the queues based on the conditions provided in the problem description. Finally, it prints 'D' if the `d_queue` is not empty, indicating a majority for 'D', and 'R' if the `d_queue` is empty, indicating a majority for 'R'. 

The annotations provided in the code give a clear explanation of the state of the program after each step, helping to understand how the queues are updated and how the voting process is simulated. By following the code and the annotations, it can be verified that the program behaves as expected and provides the correct outcome for the vote based on the given input.
