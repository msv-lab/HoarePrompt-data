The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output the remaining fraction of employees after eliminating one person each round. The elimination process follows the rule that if the first person in the line is a 'D', then the next 'D' person in line will be eliminated, and vice versa for 'R'. This process continues until there is only one party remaining. The function should return the party ('D' or 'R') of the last person standing.
