Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It keeps track of the indices of the employees belonging to each fraction and then iterates through the queues while denying the right to vote to the corresponding employee. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining queues at the end of the simulation. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
