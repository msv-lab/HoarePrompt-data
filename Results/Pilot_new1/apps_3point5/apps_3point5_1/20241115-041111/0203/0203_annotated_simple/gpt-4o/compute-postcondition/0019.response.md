Output State: **If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length at least 1. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value of `i` and `r_queue` is empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value of `i` and `d_queue` is empty. After the if-else block executes, either `d_queue` contains the value of `i` and `r_queue` is empty, or `r_queue` contains the value of `i` and `d_queue` is empty based on the value of `v`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.**
