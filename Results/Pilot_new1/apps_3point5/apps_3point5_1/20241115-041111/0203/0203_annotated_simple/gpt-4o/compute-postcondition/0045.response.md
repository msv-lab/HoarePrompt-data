Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will continuously pop elements from both queues, compare their values, and append new elements based on the comparison. If at any point either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, an error will occur. The loop control variables `d_index` and `r_index` will hold the values of the popped elements. If `d_queue` is not empty, the program prints 'D'. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` and `r_index` are not defined, and the program prints 'R'.***
