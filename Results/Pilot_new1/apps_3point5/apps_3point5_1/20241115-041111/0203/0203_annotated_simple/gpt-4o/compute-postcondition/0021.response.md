Example Answer:
If `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue` and `r_queue` remains empty. If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs as there is no element to pop from `d_queue`. The code pops the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`.
Output State: **If `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue` and `r_queue` is empty. If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs. `r_index` is assigned the popped element from `r_queue`.**
