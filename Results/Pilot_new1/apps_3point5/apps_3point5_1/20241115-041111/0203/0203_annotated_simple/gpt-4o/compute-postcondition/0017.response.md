Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length at least 2. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the values of `i + 1` and `r_queue` is empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the values of `i + 1` and `d_queue` is empty. After the if-else block executes, either `d_queue` contains the values of `i + 1` and `r_queue` is empty, or `r_queue` contains the values of `i + 1` and `d_queue` is empty based on the value of `v`. Furthermore, in the else part, `r_queue` contains the appended value of `i`.***
