According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `d_queue` should not be empty.
2. `r_queue` should not be empty.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, `r_queue` either has the new element `d_index + n` appended to it (if `d_index` is less than `r_index`) or contains the value of `r_index + n` (if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`). If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs. `r_index` is assigned the popped element from `r_queue`.**
