Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is increased by 1, so after execution, `remocrats` is incremented by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is incremented by 2**
