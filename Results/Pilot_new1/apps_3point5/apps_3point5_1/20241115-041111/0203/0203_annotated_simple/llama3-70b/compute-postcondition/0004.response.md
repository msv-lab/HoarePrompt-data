According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. Since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. So, for the loop to be executed, the fractions list must have at least 1 fraction.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, fractions list has at least 1 fraction**
