Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `r_queue`. The other variables `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
