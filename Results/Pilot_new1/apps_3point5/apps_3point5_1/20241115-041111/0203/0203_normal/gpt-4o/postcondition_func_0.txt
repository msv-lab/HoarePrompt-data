The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` from input. It then processes the votes to determine the winner between 'D' and 'R' based on certain rules. The function creates separate queues for 'D' and 'R' characters, updates their indices according to the given rules, and prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty after processing, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function operates within the constraints where n is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and votes is a string of length n consisting of only 'D' and 'R' characters.
