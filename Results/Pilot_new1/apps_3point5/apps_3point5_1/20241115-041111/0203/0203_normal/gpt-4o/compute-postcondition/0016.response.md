Example Answer:
The code appends the index `i` to the `r_queue`. The previous state of the variables is as described above. After execution, the `r_queue` will contain the appended index `i+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `r_queue` contains the index `i+1` and `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `r_queue` contains the index `i+1` and `d_queue` is an empty list**
