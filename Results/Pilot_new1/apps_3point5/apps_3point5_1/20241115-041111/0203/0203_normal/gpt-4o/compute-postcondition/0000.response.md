Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must be between 1 and 200,000. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
