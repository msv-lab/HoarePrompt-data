Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters, r_queue will be updated after popping the front element, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. Additionally, d_index is less than r_index***
