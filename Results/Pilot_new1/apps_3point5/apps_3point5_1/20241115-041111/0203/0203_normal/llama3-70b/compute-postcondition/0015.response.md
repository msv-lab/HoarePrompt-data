Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The initial state does not provide specific values for `depublicans` or `remocrats`, so after execution, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a string of length n with at least 2 characters remaining. If the first character of fractions is 'D', then depublicans is increased by 1. Otherwise, remocrats is incremented by 1.
