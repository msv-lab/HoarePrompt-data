According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. If the string `fractions` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, depublicans is 0 and remocrats is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the string `fractions` must have at least 1 character, and the `fraction` is the first character in the string.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a string of length n with at least 1 character, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0, fraction is the first character in the string**
