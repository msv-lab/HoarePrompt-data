Example Answer:
`b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` is the integer value obtained from the split operation of the input and `m` is assigned the value from the input split operation. Therefore, the value of `b_floor` is determined by the formula. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`**
