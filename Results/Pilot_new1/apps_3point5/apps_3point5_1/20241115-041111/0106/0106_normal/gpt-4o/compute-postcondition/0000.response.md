Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `apartment` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `block`. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.**
