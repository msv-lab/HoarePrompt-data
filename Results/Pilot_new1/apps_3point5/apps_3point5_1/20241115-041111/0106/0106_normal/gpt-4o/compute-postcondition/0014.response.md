Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. It calculates the total time required to move from apartment `a` to apartment `b` considering different scenarios such as the location of the apartments, the floor of apartment `a`, walking distances, and time to reach the target floor. The function accurately calculates the total time based on the provided parameters and returns this value.**
