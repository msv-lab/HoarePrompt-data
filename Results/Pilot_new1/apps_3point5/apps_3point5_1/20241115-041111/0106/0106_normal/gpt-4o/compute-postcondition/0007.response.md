Output State: **`block_a, floor_a, block_b, floor_b` are assigned the locations of apartments a and b. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is set to 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the absolute difference between `floor_a` and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15.**
