The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The preconditions for the input parameters are that `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. 

The function returns the value of 'block' calculated based on a formula using the input parameters, and the value of 'floor'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an `apartment` parameter based on certain preconditions, calculate the 'block' value using a formula, and return the 'block' value along with the 'floor' value.
