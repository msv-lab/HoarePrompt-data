Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. This covers all possible scenarios where `a_floor` can be greater, equal to, or less than `b_floor`, ensuring the correct calculation of `min_floor_time` based on the given conditions.***
