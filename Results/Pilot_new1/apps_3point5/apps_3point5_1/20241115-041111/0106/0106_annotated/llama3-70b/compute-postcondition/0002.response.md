Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `a` and `m` are known based on the input split by spaces. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`**
