Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input provided. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers**
