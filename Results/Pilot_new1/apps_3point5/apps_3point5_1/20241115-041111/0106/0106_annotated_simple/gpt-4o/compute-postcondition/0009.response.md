Example Answer:
The variable `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are positive integers, so `min_walk_time` will hold the minimum value between them. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, k, a, b, block_a, floor_a, block_b, floor_b, time_to_exit, direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time.
Output State: **n, m, k, a, b, block_a, floor_a, block_b, floor_b, time_to_exit, direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time are positive integers satisfying the given conditions; min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time**
