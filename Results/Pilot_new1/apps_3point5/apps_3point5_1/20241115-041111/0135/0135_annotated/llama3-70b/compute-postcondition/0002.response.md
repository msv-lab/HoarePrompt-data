According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers based on user input which means they can have any value. The set `seen` being empty does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` should be integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers based on user input, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
