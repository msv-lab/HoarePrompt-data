Output State: **If k is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the remainder of n divided by i for each i from 1 to k. If a previously calculated remainder is found in seen, 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the remainder is added to seen.**
