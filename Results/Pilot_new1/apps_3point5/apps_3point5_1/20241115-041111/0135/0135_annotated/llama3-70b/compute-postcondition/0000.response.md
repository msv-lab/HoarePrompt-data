Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts inputs separated by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined based on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers based on user input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers based on user input**
