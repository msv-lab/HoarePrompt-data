Functionality: **The function reads two integers n and k from input, then iterates from 1 to k calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If a previously calculated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not actually calculate or return the value of n raised to the power of k as indicated in the annotations.**
