The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ i ≤ k. If k is greater than or equal to n, the program returns 'No'. If k is less than 1 or n is 0, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop checks if the remainder of n divided by i is already in seen_remainders. If it is, the program returns 'No'. If not, the loop adds the current remainder to seen_remainders and continues to the next iteration. Finally, the function returns 'Yes'. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine whether there are any repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k, and return 'No' if there are, or 'Yes' if there are no repeated remainders.
