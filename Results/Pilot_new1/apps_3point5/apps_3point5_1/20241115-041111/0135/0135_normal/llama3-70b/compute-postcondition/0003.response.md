Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. The value of `remainder` will be the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. The `seen` set is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i**
