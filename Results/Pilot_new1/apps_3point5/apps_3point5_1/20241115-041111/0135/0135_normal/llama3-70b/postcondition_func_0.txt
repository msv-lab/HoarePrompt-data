The function reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.
