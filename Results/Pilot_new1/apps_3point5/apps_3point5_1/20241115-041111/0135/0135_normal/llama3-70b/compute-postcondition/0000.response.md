Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `k` can be any positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
