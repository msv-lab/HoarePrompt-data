According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 0. Since k is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, seen_remainders is an empty set**
