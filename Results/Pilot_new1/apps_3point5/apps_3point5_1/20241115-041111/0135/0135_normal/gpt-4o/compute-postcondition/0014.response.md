Output State: `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1. If the remainder of n % i is already in the set seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the if else block. If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. If k is less than n, then `n` and `k` remain unchanged after the loop executes.
