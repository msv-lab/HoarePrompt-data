According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is within the range (1 to k). At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`**
