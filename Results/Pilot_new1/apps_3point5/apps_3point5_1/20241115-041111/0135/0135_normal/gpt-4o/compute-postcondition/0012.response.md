Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`. The value of `n` and `i` are not specified, but `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`**
