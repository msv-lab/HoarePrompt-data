Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far. If a remainder is already in the set, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The program follows the problem description for every potential case as it ensures that all remainders are unique before printing "Yes".
