According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, and `i` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 3, and remainder is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 4, remainder is either 0 or 1**
