Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is assigned as the result of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and i = 3, the possible values of `remainder` can be 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 3, remainder is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 3, remainder is either 0 or 1**
