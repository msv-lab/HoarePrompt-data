Output State: 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute and the function returns 'No'.
- If k is less than n, the loop iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop continues until k is reached.
- After the loop executes, n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = k, remainder is either 0 or 1.
