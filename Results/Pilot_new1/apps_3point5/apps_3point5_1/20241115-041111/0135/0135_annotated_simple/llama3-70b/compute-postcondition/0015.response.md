According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 1 which is 0, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2. Since the loop can execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is incremented by 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2**
