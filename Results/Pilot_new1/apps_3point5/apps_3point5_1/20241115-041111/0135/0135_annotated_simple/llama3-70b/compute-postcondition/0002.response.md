According to the code, the loop will execute k times where k is an integer between 1 and 10^18. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, and `seen` is an empty set. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1 and go up to k, so the state should be modified as follows:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
