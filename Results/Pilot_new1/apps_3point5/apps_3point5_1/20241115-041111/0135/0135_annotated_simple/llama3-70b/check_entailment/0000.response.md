Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if all the remainders of n divided by each i from 1 to k are distinct. If any remainder is found to be a duplicate, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines whether the remainders are distinct or not.
