Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 1 which is 0. If the value of `remainder` is in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues with the initial state intact.***
