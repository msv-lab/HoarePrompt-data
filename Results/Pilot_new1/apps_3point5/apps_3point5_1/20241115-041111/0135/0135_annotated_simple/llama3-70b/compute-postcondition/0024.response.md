The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the result of a mathematical operation involving the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The specific mathematical operation to be performed is not specified in the description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform a mathematical operation on the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are within the specified constraints.
