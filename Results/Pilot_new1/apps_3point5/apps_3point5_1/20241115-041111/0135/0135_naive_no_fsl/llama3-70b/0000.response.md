Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and exits the loop and prints "No" if a duplicate remainder is found. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
