Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct. It iterates through each i from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if that remainder is already seen in the set of seen remainders. If it encounters a duplicate remainder, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
