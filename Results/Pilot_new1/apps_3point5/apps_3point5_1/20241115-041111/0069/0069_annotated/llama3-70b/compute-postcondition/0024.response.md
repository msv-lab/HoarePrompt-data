Postcondition: ***T + 1 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is not equal to 0, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
