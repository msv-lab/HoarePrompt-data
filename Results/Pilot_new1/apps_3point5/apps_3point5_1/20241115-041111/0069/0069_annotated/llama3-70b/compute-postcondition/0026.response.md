Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: T + 2 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1.
Output State: **T + 2 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1**
