According to the code, the loop will execute T times, where T is a positive integer. At the end of the last iteration, T + 1 is a positive integer. The loop will continue executing as long as the current iteration is less than T. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, T needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **T + 2 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1**
