Example Answer:
The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `s` are based on the values at the respective indices in the `data` list. After the increment, the new values of `n`, `x`, and `s` will be assigned based on the new index value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list**
