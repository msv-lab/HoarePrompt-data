Example Answer: 
The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, so after execution, `index` will be increased by 3. Since `s` is assigned the value at index + 2 in the list `data`, the value of `s` will also change accordingly based on the updated value of `index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3**
