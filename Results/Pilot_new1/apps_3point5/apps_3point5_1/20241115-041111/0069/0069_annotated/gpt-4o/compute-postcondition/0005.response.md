According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `data` is a list containing the split input values, `T` is an integer extracted from the first element of `data`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `T` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, `T` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
