Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has at least two elements, `count` is incremented by 2 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. Otherwise, `count` is incremented by 1.***
