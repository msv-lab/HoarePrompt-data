Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), then `count` is increased by 1. The list `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in the list. After the execution of the if statement, if the condition is met, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
