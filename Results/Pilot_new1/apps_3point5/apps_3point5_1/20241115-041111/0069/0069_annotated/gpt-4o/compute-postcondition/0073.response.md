Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`count` is an integer increased by 1, `prefix_balances` has more elements, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances**.
