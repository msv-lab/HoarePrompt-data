Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once, updating the `prefix_balances` list based on the condition `1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute. Additionally, when the `balance` is 0, the program will enter the if condition. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, -1 is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
