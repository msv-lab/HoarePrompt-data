According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, `T` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index 1, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index 2, `s` is a string extracted from `data` at index 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's in `s` minus counting '1's in `s`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1.
