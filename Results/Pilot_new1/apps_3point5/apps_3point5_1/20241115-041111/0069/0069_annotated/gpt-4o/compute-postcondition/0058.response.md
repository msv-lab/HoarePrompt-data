Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, the `prefix_balances` list will be updated based on the condition `1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute. Additionally, when the `balance` is 0, the program will enter the if condition. `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list***
