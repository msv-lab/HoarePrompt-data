Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The code does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the balance is not zero.

An example where the code fails is for the input:
```
1
5 2
10101
```
According to the problem description, the correct output should be 0, as there are no prefixes of the infinite string with a balance of 2. However, the code will output 1 for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the expected output for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations did not influence this conclusion as they did not cover this specific case.
