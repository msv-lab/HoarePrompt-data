Example Answer:
`prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list**
