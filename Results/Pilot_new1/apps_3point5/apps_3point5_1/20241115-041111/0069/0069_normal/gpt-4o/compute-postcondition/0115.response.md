Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 3*n + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by `3*n + 3`, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The `prefix_balances` list is updated based on the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` with the new values calculated for each index `i`. If `balance` is equal to 0, then the results list appends -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise, it appends 0. In the else part, the results list appends the count of elements that satisfy the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` for each element `b` in `prefix_balances`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, ensuring the correct updating of the results list based on the conditions met during the execution of the if-else block.***
