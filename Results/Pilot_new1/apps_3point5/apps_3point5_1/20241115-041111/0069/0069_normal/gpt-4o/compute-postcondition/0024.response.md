Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`, `balance` is 0, and `results` will have 0 appended. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` will remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s, `balance` is 0, and `results` will have 0 appended. The element `x` is not in `prefix_balances`.**
