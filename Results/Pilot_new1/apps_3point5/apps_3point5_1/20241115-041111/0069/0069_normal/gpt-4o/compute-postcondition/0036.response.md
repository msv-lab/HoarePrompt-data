Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not provided, so the new value of `count` is the previous value plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has even more elements, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has even more elements, `count` is incremented by 1**
