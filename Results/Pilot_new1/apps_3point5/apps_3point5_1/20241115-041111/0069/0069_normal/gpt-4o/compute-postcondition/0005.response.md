According to the code, the loop will execute `T` number of times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. Since the loop uses `_` as the loop variable, the loop body does not actually depend on the loop variable. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `data` is a list containing the input values, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
State: **`data` is a list containing the input values, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
