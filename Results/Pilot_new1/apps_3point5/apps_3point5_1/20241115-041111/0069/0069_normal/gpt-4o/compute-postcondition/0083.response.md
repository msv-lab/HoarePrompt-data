Example Answer:
The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, where `index` is now increased by 3. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3**
