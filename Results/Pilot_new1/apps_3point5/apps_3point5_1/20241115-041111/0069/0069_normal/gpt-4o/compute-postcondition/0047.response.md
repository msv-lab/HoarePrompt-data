Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3. Then, the variable `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`. 
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`**
