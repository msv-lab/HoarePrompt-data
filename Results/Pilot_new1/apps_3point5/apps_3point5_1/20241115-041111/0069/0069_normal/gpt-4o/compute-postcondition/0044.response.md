Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`. The impact of this assignment depends on the values of `data` and `index`. Since the initial state of `data` and `index` is not provided, the output state cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `data` and `index`**
