Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is updated based on the formula provided, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases where the program fragment is executed successfully.***
