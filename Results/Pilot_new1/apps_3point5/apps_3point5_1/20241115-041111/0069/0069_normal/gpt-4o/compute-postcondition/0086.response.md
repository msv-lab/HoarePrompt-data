According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the values of `s`, `index`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states:
1. `s` should be assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`.
2. `index` should be increased by 3.
3. `balance` should be calculated.
4. `prefix_balances` should be a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.

State: **`s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
