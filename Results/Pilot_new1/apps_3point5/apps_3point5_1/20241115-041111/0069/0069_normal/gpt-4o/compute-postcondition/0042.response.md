According to the code, the loop will execute at least once for each value in the range of `T`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`.
- If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s.
- `balance` is not equal to 0.
- `x` is in `prefix_balances`, and based on that, either -1 or 0 is appended to `results`.
- The variable `count` has been incremented based on certain conditions for each element in `prefix_balances`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` should be updated based on the provided formula for the next index.
- If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` should remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s.
- `balance` should remain not equal to 0.
- `x` being in `prefix_balances` should be checked again to determine whether -1 or 0 should be appended to `results`.
- The variable `count` should be updated based on the conditions for each element in the updated `prefix_balances`.

State: **Adjust `prefix_balances` based on the formula for the next index, keep `balance` not equal to 0, reevaluate `x` in `prefix_balances` for appending to `results`, update `count` based on conditions for each element in `prefix_balances`**
