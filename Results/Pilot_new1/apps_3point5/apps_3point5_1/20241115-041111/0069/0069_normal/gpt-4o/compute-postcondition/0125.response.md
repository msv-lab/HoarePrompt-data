Output State: **If n is greater than 0, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index n. If n is 0 or lower, prefix_balances will remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s. The variable balance will be calculated accordingly. The loop will print the results after each iteration.**
