Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` remains non-zero, `prefix_balances` still consists of zeros with a length greater than `n + 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied. The postcondition ensures that all initial conditions are retained, and `count` is updated accordingly if the specified condition is met.***
