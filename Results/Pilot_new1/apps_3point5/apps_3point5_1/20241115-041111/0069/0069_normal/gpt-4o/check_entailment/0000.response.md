Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly calculates the balance of the prefixes and checks certain conditions involving `x`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` to determine the number of prefixes with a balance equal to `x`. However, the code fails to handle the case where there is an infinite number of such prefixes. The code incorrectly returns `0` instead of `-1` for cases where there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
