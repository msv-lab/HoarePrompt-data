Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
