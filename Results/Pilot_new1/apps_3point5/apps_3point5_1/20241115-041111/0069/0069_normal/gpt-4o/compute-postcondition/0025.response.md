Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`, and `balance` is 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s, and `balance` is 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. This ensures that `results` contains the appropriate value based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances` and the initial conditions of `n` and `s`.***
