Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input. The balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the balance is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, if ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0), the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). The postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions and handling all edge cases.***
