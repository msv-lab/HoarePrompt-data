Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input**
