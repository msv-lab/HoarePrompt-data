According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is greater than 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input. The balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
