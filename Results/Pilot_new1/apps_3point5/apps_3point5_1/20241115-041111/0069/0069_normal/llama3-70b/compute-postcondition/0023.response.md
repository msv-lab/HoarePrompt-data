Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, n and x are assigned values based on input, s contains the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is calculated as the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
