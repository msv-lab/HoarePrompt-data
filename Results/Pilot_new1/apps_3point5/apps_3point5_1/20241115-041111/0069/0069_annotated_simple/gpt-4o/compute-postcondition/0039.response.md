Output State: **count is an integer, prefix_balances is a list with at least one element, b is an element in the list, x is an integer. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then count is increased by 1. If prefix_balances is an empty list, the loop does not execute and count remains 0.**
