Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a given balance $x$. It handles all test cases provided in the problem description, including cases where there are an infinite number of prefixes. The logic for updating the prefix balances and counting the prefixes with the desired balance is implemented correctly. The program also correctly handles edge cases such as when the balance is zero and when the loop does not execute.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the expected output for the given inputs.
