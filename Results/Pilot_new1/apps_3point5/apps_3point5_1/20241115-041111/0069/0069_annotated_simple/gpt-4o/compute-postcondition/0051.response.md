According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` needs to be incremented by 1 since the loop is iterating up to `n + 1`.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `prefix_balances[i]` needs to be updated based on the calculation provided in the loop statement.
State: **`n` is an integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
