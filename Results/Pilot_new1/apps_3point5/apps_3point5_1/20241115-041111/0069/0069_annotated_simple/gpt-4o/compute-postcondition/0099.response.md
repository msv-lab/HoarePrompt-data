Postcondition: ***Output State: If n is at least 1, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, balance is 0, x is either in or not in prefix_balances, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying conditions, results list contains the appended value of count or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances. If x is in prefix_balances, results list appends -1; otherwise, it appends 0. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. The balance is 0.***
