Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1 and balance is equal to 0, the loop calculates the prefix sum of the balance changes in string s and stores them in prefix_balances. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with length 1. If x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to results. If x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended to results.***
