Postcondition: ***Output State: If n is at least 1, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, balance is 0, x is either in or not in prefix_balances, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying conditions, results list contains the appended value of count or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances. If x is in prefix_balances, results list appends -1; otherwise, it appends 0. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. The balance is 0. In the if part, if balance is 0, then based on whether x is in prefix_balances, -1 or 0 is appended to the results list. In the else part, count is the number of times the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied in the loop. The results list contains the appended value of count. T is greater than 1, n is assigned the value of int(data[index]), x is assigned the value of int(data[index + 1]), s is assigned the value of data[index + 2, index is increased by 3, and prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the given formula. The loop increments count each time the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is met. All possible edge cases, including cases where the loop does not execute, are handled to ensure the correctness of the program's execution.***
