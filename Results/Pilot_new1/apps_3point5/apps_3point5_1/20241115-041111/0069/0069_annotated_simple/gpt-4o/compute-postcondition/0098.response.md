Output State: If n is at least 1, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, balance is 0, x is not in prefix_balances, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying conditions, results list contains the appended value of count, T is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the given formula. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. The balance is 0. `results` list contains the appended value of 0.
