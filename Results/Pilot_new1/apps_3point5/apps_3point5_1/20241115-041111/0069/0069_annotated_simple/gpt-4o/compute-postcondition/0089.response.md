Output State: If n is at least 1, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 2, balance is 0, x is in prefix_balances or not, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying conditions, results list contains the appended value of count, T is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `prefix_balances[i+1]` is updated based on the given formula, `i` is 1 less than `n`. `prefix_balances[i]` is updated according to the formula provided.
