Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied. If `prefix_balances` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `balance` is 0, the loop will not execute as well.**
