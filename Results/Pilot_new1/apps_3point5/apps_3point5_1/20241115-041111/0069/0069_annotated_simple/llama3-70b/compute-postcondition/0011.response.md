Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1. The balance is not equal to x, and the condition ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0) is false***
