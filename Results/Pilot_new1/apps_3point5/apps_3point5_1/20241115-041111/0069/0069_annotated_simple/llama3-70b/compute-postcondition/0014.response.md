Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n, x are input integers, s is an input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then the program prints n + 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) to handle all possible scenarios including edge cases.***
