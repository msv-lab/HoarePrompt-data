Example Answer:
The input string is stored in variable `s`. The previous values of `T`, `n`, and `x` are positive integers. Therefore, the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string**
