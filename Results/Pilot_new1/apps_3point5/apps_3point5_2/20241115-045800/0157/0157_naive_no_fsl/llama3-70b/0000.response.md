Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Then it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the minimum by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. This logic covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
