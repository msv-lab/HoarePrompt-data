Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` can be any positive integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
