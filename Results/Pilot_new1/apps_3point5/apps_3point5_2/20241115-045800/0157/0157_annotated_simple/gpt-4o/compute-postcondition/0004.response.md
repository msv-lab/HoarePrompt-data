Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the smallest integer among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4. The value of `max_lemons` depends on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, so the value of `total_fruits` will also vary accordingly.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the smallest integer among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, `total_fruits` is the result of the calculation based on the input values**
