Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, it will print 'YES', which is correct.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0, it means the sequence will have the same number repeated, and in that case, it will print 'NO', which is correct.
3. If the favorite number b can be reached from the first element a by adding multiples of the difference c, and the number of steps to reach b is non-negative, it will print 'YES', which is correct.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it will print 'NO', which is also correct. 

Therefore, the program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for each of them.
