Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If b is equal to a, then the favorite number b appears in the sequence at the first position, so the program correctly outputs "YES".
2. If c is equal to 0, then the sequence will have all elements equal to a, and since b is equal to a, the favorite number b appears in the sequence, so the program correctly outputs "YES".
3. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is greater than or equal to 0, then b appears in the sequence, so the program outputs "YES".
4. If none of the above conditions are met, then the program outputs "NO" as expected. 

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, hence it is correct.
