Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect the initial state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. `c` is not equal to 0. The result of `(b - a) / c` is an integer and non-negative.**
