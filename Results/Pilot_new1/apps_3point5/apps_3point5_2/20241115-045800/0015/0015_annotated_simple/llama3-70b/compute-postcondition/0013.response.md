Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, then if `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, and the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed. The result of (b - a) / c is an integer and non-negative when the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.***
