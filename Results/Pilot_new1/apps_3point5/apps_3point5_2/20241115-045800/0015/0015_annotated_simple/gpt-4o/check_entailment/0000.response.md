Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. It checks if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence `s` based on the conditions provided. It accounts for cases where `b` is equal to the first element `a`, where the difference `c` between neighboring elements is 0, and where the division of `b - a` by `c` results in a non-negative integer or the remainder of the division is 0. The program prints "YES" if `b` appears in the sequence `s` and "NO" otherwise. The logic and conditions in the program cover all potential cases, making it correct.
