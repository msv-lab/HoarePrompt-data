Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
