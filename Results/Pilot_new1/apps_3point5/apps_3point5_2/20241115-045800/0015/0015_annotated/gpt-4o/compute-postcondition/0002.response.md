Example Answer:
The code prints 'YES' to the console. The values of `a` and `b` are equal, and they are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input string. The values of `a` and `b` are not changed by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input string, and the code prints 'YES'.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input string, and the code prints 'YES'**
