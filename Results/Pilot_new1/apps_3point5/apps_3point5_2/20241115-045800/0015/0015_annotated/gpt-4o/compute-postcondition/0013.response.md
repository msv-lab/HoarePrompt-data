Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
