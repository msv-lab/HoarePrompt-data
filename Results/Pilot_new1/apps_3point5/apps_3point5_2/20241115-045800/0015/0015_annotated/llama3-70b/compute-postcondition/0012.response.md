Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input split. The value of `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where the division of (b - a) by c results in an integer and the result is non-negative.***
