Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. This postcondition covers all potential scenarios and edge cases of the program execution, ensuring a comprehensive summary of the possible outcomes.***
