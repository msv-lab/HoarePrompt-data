Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, which matches the problem description.
- If `c` is 0, it correctly checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. This aligns with the problem description where Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative. This logic also matches the problem description where the sequence has a difference of `c` between neighboring elements and checks if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence.
