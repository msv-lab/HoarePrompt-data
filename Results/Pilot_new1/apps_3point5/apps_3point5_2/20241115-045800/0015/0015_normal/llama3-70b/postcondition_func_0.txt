The function reads three integers a, b, and c from the user input. If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. If c is not 0, it checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This function covers scenarios where c is 0, a equals b, and the condition for divisibility and non-negativity in the second case.
