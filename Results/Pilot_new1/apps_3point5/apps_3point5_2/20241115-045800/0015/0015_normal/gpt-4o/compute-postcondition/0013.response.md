Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, covering all possible scenarios with the input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
