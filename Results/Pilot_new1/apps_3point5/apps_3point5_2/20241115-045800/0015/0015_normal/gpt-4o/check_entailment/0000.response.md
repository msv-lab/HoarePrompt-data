Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
- It then checks the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine the output message as described in the problem statement.
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES', which is correct as the favorite number is the first element of the sequence.
- If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO', which is correct as the sequence cannot be formed with a difference of 0.
- If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not 0, and the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, it prints 'YES', which is correct for cases where `b` can be reached from `a` with the given difference `c`.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO', which is also correct for cases where `b` cannot be reached from `a` with the given difference `c`.
