Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of cubes and the faces of each cube. It then iterates through all possible numbers from 1 to x, where x is the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. The program checks if Masha can form each number by checking if the digits of the number can be found on the faces of the cubes. If a digit cannot be found on any cube, the program returns False, indicating that the number cannot be formed. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the number can be formed. The program then returns the maximum number x that can be formed. 

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, as it correctly determines the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. The program considers all possible cases and iterates through all numbers from 1 to x, ensuring that it covers all scenarios where Masha can or cannot form a number.
