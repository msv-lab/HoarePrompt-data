Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the cube and adds its string representation to the set `digits`. The previous state of `digits` contains the string representations of the digits in the first cube. After running the code, the string representations of the digits in the next cube are added to `digits`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least two cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube and the string representations of the digits in the next cube in the cubes list are added to `digits`**
