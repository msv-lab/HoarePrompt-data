According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the cubes list is already defined, so the only adjustment needed is to set cube as the first cube in the cubes list.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first cube in the cubes list**
