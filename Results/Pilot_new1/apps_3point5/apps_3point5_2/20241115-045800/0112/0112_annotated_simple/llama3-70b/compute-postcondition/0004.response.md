Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube and converts it to a string, then adds it to the `digits` set. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is an empty set, and `cube` is the first cube in the cubes list. After running the code, the `digits` set will contain the string representations of the digits in the first cube.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the cubes list**
