Example Answer:
The code creates a list of lists named `cubes` where each inner list contains integers obtained by splitting the input. Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, the number of inner lists in `cubes` will be between 1 and 3. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting**
