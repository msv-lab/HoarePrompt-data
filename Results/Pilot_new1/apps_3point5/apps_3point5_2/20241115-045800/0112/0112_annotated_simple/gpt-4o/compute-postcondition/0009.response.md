Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If the `i`-th cube has not been used and the current digit is in the `i`-th cube faces, then the `i`-th cube is marked as used, `found` becomes True, and the loop breaks. This ensures that after the execution, the state of the program variables satisfies the described conditions.***
