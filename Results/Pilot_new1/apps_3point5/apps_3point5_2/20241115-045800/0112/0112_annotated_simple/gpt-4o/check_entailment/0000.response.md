Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `can_form_number`, to solve the given problem.
2. `func_1` iterates over numbers starting from 1 and increments `x` until `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns false, which means it finds the largest number that Masha can form using the given cubes.
3. `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes. It iterates through each digit of the number and checks if it can be formed by any of the cube faces. If a digit cannot be formed, it returns false, otherwise true.
4. The functions work correctly as per the problem description for all potential cases and examples provided.
5. The program handles the constraints of the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
