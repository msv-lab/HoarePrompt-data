According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to False, and `found` is False. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to False, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
