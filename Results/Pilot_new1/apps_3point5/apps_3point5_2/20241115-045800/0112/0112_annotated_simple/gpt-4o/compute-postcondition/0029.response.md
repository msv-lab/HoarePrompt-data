According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more digits in the list to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state, and `found` is False. Since the next digit in the list is considered, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that the next digit in the list should be considered as the current digit.
State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state, `found` is False, next digit in the list is considered**
