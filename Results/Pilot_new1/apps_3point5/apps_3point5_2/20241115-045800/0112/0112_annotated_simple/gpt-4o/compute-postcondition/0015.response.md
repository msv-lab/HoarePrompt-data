According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- If the condition for marking the `i`-th cube as used and setting `found` to True is not met, then no changes need to be made to `used_cubes` or `found`.
- If the condition is met, then the `i`-th element in `used_cubes` needs to be set to True.
- `found` needs to be set to True if the condition is met.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1**
