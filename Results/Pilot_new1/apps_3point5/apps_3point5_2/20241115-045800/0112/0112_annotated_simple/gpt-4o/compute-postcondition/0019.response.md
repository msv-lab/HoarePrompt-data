Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. If the `i`-th cube has not been used and the digit is in the `i`-th cube's faces, then the `i`-th cube is marked as used, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. The state of the program variables is updated accordingly after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
