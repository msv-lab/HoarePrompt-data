Example Answer:
The list `used_cubes` is initialized with n elements, each set to `False`. The variables `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, digits is a list containing the individual digits of the number num, used_cubes is a list of n elements initialized to False.
Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, digits is a list containing the individual digits of the number num, used_cubes is a list of n elements initialized to False**
