Output State: **If num is a positive integer and there are at least n cubes with faces represented in cube_faces, the loop will iterate through each digit in the number num and check if it can be formed by any of the cubes' faces. If a digit cannot be formed by any cube, the loop will return False. If all digits can be formed by at least one cube face, the loop will complete without any changes to the initial state. If n is 0 or cube_faces is empty, the loop will not execute.**
