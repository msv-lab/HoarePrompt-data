Example Answer:
The code snippet reads n lists of integers from input and stores them in the variable cubes. Each list represents the digits on the faces of a cube. Since n is between 1 and 3, the program will read between 1 and 3 cubes. The values of the cubes are not specified, so the output state is: n is an input integer, cubes contain the digits of the faces of 1 to 3 cubes.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain the digits of the faces of 1 to 3 cubes**
