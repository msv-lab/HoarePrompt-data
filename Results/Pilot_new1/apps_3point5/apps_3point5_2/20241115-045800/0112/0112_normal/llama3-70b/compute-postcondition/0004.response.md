Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the cube and converts it to a string, adding it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is the first cube in the list, and it contains at least 1 cube, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representation of each digit in the cube. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cube**
