Example Answer:
The code snippet iterates over each cube in the list of cubes and converts each digit in the cube to a string before adding it to the set `digits`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the cubes, we can only determine that the set `digits` will be updated with the string representation of digits found in the cubes. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes**
