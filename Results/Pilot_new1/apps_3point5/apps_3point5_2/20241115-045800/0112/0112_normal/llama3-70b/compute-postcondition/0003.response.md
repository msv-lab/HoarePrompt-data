According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list contains at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. Initially, the digits set is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being iterated is the first cube in the list.
State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 1 cube, digits is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
