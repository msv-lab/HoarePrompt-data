According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list contains more cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes contain at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must contain at least 2 cubes.
State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cube**
