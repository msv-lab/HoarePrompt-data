Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` in the code calculates the value of `x` based on the value of `n` within the range [1, 3], but the logic is incorrect. The function should iterate over the cubes to check if Masha can form all numbers from 1 to `x` using her cubes, but it does not do so correctly. The `can_form_number` function also has issues with the logic of checking if a number can be formed using the available cube faces. 

For example, if we consider the input:
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

The expected output is 98, but the code may not be able to correctly determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. The code has issues with properly checking if all numbers from 1 to x can be formed using the cube faces provided. Hence, the code is incorrect.
