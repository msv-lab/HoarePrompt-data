According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are digits to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans, `found` is either True or False depending on whether the digit was found on a cube face, and n is the length of the list of cubes. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next digit needs to be processed. This means that the loop will continue as long as there are digits left to iterate over. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the index of the digit being processed.

State: **After the loop executes, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise. `found` is True if the digit is found on any cube face and False otherwise. If the digit is found on a cube face and that cube has not been used before, the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the digit is not found on any cube face, `found` remains False. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. After the if statement executes, if `found` is False, the program returns False. The next digit in the list needs to be processed in the next iteration.**
