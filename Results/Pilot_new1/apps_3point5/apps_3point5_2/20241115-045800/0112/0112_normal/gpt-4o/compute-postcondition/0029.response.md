According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans, `found` is False, and there are more digits left in the `digits` list. To execute the loop one more time, the next digit in the list needs to be processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the next digit in the list needs to be considered.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise, `found` is False, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, the next digit in the list needs to be processed**
