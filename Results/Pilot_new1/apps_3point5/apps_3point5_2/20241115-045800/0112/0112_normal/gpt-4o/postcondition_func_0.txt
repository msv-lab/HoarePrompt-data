The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and cubes, and calculates the value of x based on the value of n within the range [1, 3]. If n is 1, x is 1. If n is 2, x is 2. If n is 3, x is 4. If n is not within the range [1, 3], x remains 0. The function iterates over the cubes to create a set of cube faces but this set is not used in the final return value.
