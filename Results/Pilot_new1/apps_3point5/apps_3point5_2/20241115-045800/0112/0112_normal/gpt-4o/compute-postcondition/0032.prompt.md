You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n ≤ 3). cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). num is a positive integer.**
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: Output State: 
After the loop executes, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise. `found` is True if the digit is found on any cube face and False otherwise. If the digit is found on a cube face and that cube has not been used before, the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the digit is not found on any cube face, `found` remains False. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. After the if statement executes, if `found` is False, the program returns False. If there are more digits left in the `digits` list after the loop executes, `found` remains False.

Case_2: The program returns True

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
