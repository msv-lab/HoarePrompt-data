According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if i is equal to the index of the cube where the digit is found, `found` is True if the digit is found on a cube face and False otherwise.

To execute one more iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` should be greater than the current value of `n` to ensure the loop can execute again.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if i is equal to the index of the cube where the digit is found, `found` is True if the digit is found on a cube face and False otherwise, `n` is greater than the previous value of n**
