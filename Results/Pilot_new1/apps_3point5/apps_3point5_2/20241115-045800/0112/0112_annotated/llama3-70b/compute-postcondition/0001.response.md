Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains integers obtained by splitting the input. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, the input will be taken `n` times to populate the `cubes` list. The values of `n` and `cubes` will be determined by the input provided. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input**
