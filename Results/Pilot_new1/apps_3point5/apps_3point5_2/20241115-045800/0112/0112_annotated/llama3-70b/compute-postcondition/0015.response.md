Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `max_num`. Since there are no operations or changes to any variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`cubes` is a list with at least one sublist or empty, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits, '0' is removed if not in `digits`, `max_num` is an integer**
