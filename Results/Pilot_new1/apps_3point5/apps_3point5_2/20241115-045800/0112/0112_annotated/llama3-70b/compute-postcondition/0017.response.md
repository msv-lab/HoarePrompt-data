Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts the digits from each cube, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them to form a number, and prints the maximum number that can be formed from the digits of all cubes combined.**
