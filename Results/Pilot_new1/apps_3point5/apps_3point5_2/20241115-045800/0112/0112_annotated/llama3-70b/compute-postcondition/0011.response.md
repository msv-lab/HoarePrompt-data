Postcondition: ***The loop updates the set `digits` with string representations of the digits in each sublist of `cubes`. If `cubes` is a list with at least one sublist, the loop will execute at least once. If `cubes` is empty, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. Additionally, '0' is in the set `digits`.***
