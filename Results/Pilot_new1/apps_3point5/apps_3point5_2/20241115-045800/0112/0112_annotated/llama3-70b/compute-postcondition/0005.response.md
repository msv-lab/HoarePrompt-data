According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3'}. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 sublists and `cube` should be the second sublist in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 2 sublists, `cube` is the second sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3'}**
