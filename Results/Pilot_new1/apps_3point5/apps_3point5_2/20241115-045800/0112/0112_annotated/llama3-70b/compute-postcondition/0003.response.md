According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. At the start, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, so it does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 1 sublist, and `cube` is the first sublist in the list of cubes.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in the list**
