Example Answer:
Each digit in the second sublist `cube` is converted to a string and added to the set `digits` using the `update` method. The initial state shows that `digits` contains {'1', '2', '3'}. After the code execution, the set `digits` will be updated with the digits from the second sublist `cube`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 2 sublists, `cube` is the second sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3', 'digit1', 'digit2', ...}**
