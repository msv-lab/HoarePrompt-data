Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated to include the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list. Since `cube` is the third sublist in the `cubes` list, the `digits` set will now contain the string representation of each digit in the third sublist. The initial state remains the same for `n`, `cubes`, and `cube`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 3 sublists, `cube` is the third sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3', 'digit1', 'digit2', ...} updated with string representations of digits in the third sublist**
