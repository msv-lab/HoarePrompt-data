The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, and `cubes`, a list of lists where each inner list represents the numbers on each face of a cube. The function calculates the smallest number `x` that can be formed using the unique numbers on the faces of the cubes. If `n` is at least 1, `x` is determined as the smallest number that can be formed. If `n` is 0, `x` remains 0. If `n` is greater than 3, the loop stops when `x` reaches 4.
