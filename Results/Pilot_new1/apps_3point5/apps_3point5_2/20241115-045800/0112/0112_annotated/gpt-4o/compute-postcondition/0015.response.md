According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop was terminated if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
