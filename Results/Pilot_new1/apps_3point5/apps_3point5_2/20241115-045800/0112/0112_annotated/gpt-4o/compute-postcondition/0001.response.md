Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, where each element is initialized to `False`. The value of `n` is unknown as it is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `digits` is a list containing the digits of the unknown number `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing the digits of the unknown number `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`**
