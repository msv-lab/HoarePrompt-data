Postcondition: ***If `digits` contains at least one digit and there exists an index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then after the loop executes and `found` is False, the `i-th` element of `used_cubes` will be set to True, `found` will be True, and the loop will be terminated. The value of `i` will be the index where the condition was met. If no such index exists, `found` will remain False, and all other variables will remain unchanged. If `digits` is empty or none of the conditions are met, the loop will not execute, and `found` will remain False, `used_cubes` will remain unchanged, and `i` will not be updated.***
