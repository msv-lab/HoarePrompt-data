According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `digits` contains at least one digit. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is terminated. If the conditions are not met, there is no change in the variables.

To execute the loop one more time, the `i` should be less than `n` and the conditions for setting `used_cubes[i]` to True, `found` to True, and incrementing `i` should not be met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]` for the current `i`, `found` is False, `i` is less than `n`**
