Since the loop iterates over each digit in the `digits` list, the loop can execute if there is at least one digit in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one digit. Additionally, the loop does not depend on the `used_cubes` list, so it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`**
