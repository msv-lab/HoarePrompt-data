Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The updated number of occurrences of the next `char` is also added to `res`. The next `char` after the current one is in the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end**
