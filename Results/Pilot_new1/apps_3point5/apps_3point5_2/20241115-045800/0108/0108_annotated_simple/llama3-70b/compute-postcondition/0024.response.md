Output State: **If `char` is present in `s`, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet in each iteration until `char` is no longer present in `s`. `alphabet` remains unchanged. `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of `char` after each iteration. If `char` is not present in `s` initially, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain the same as the initial state.**
