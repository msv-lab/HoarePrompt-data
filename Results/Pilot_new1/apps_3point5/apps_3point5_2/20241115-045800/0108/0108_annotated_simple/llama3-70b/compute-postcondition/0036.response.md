According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in string `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is present in `s`, then `res` contains the first character in the alphabet string followed by the updated number of occurrences of the next char. If `char` is not present in `s`, the loop doesn't execute and the value of `res` remains the same.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet string after the current `char` needs to be considered. If `char` is present in `s`, then the state that needs to be adjusted is to update `char` to the next character in the alphabet string and reset the number of occurrences. If `char` is not present in `s`, then no states need to be adjusted.

State: **If char is present in s, res contains the next character in the alphabet string followed by the updated number of occurrences. If char is not present in s, the loop doesn't execute and the value of res remains the same.**
