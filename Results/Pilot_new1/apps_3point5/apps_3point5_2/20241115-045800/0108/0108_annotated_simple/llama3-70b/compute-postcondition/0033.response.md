Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The updated string is stored in `s`. The previous value of `res` is not mentioned, so the output state is: `res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end**
