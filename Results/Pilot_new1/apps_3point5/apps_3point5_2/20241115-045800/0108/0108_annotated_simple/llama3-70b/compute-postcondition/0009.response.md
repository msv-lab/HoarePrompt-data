According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the new `s` string must still contain the character `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by `char`**
