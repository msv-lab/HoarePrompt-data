Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character next to it in the alphabet. The value of `char` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by `char`**
