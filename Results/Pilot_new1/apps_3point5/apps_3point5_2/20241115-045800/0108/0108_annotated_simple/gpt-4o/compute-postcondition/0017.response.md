Output State: **If `target_len` is 0, then `i` is incremented until it reaches the length of `s`, `j` remains 0. If `target_len` is greater than 0 and all characters in `s` match `target`, then `i` is incremented until it reaches the length of `s`, `j` is incremented until it reaches `target_len`. If there is a mismatch between characters in `s` and `target`, then `i` is incremented until it reaches the length of `s`, `j` remains at the index of the first mismatched character in `target`.**
