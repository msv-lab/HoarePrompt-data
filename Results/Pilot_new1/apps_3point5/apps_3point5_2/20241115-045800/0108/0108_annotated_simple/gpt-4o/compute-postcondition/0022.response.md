Postcondition: ***`target_len` is an integer. If `j` equals `target_len`, the program prints the value of `target`. If `j` is less than `target_len`, indicating a mismatch between characters in `s` and `target, the program prints -1. In both cases, `i` is incremented until it reaches the length of `s`. If `target_len` is 0, `j` remains 0 throughout the execution. If `target_len` is greater than 0 and all characters in `s` match `target`, `j` is incremented until it reaches `target_len`. If there is a mismatch between characters in `s` and `target`, `j` remains at the index of the first mismatched character in `target`.***
