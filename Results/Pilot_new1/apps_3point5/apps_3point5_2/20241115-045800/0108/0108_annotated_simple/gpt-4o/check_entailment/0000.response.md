Correctness: **True**

The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to check if the characters in `s` can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. If the characters can form the subsequence, it prints the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program seems to be correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
