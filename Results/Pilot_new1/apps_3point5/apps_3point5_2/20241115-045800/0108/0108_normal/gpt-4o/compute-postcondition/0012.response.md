According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` matches `target[j] and i is less than len(s) and j is less than target_len`**
