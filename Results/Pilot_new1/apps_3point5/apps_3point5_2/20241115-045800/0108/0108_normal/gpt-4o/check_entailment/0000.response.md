Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an input string `s` and compares it to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. It then prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if `s` contains all the characters in order, otherwise it prints -1. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the case where the input string `s` can be transformed into 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' by replacing characters with their next alphabetical character. The code also accounts for the case where it is impossible to transform `s` into 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and prints -1 in that scenario. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code is working as expected.
