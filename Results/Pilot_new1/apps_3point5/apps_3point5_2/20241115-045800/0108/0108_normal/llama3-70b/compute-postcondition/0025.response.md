According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the alphabet. At the end of the last iteration, if 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by the character after the last character in 's', 'char' will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in 's'. If 's' does not contain the character 'a', 'res' will remain empty, 'char' will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in 's'. So for the loop to execute one more time, the character 's' must contain the character 'a' at least once.
State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once**
