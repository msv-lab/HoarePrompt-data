Example Answer:
'res' is appended with the value of 'char', which is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'. Since 'b' is in 's', the next character after 'b' is in 's', and 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b', the new value of 'res' will be the previous value of 'res' concatenated with the next character after 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b', 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b', and 'char' has been appended to 'res'.
Output State: **'s' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b' and 'char', 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b' and 'char' has been appended to 'res'**
