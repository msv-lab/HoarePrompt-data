According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b' and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b' and 'char' has been appended to 'res'. For the loop to execute one more time, 's' needs to contain the character after 'b' and 'char' needs to be the next character in the alphabet after that. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'s' contains the character after 'b', 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b' and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the character after 'b' and 'char' has been appended to 'res'**
