The function `func` reads an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. It builds a new string `res` by replacing characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If `s` contains all alphabet characters, it prints the alphabet in order. If not, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.
