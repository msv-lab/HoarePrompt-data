Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a', 'char', and any subsequent characters that come after 'char' in the ASCII sequence. 'char' is in 's', 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. If 's' no longer contains 'char' or 'char' is not in 's' the loop ends.**
