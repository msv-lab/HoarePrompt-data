Example Answer:
The character 'char' in the string 's' is replaced with the next character in the alphabet after 'char'. If 's' contains the character 'a', then 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' will be updated to the next character in the alphabet after the original 'char'. If 's' does not contain 'a', then the string 's' remains unchanged and 'char' is updated to the next character in the alphabet after the original 'char'. 
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the current 'char'.**
