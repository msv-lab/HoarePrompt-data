Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Since `char` is the first character in the alphabet, the replacement will be the second character in the alphabet. If `char` is 'a', then the replacement will be 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
