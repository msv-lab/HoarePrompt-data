Example Answer: 
If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the character 'a', and 'char' is in 's', then 'char' is added to 'res'. The value of 'res' changes to include the character 'a' from 'char'. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', and 'char' is in 's'.
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', and 'char' is in 's'**
