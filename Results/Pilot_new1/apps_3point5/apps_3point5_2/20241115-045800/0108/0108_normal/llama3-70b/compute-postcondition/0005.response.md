Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character 'char' in the string 's' with the next character in the alphabet. Since 'char' is the first character in the alphabet, it will be replaced by 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the character 'a', `char` is the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the character 'a', `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
