Example Answer:
If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, then 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the current 'char'. The code appends the value of 'char' to 'res'. 
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the current 'char'.**
