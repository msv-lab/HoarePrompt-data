Example Answer:
'res' is appended with the value of 'char', so the value of 'res' depends on the value of 'char'. The value of 'char' is in 's', and 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', 'char' is in 's', and 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', 'char' is in 's', and 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence**
