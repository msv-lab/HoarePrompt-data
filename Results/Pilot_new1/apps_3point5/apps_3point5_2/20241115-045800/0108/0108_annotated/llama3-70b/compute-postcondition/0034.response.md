According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the next character after the updated last character in `s` should be added to `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the current first character, `res` will contain the characters in the updated `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`, and `alphabet` contains the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`**
