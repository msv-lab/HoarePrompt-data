Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The value of `char` is the first character in the alphabet, so `res` will now contain that character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet**
