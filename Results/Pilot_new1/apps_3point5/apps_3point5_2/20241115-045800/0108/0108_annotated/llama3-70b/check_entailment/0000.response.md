Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a string `s` as input and iterates over the alphabet, incrementing each character in `s` by one until it forms the English alphabet. If the resulting string has a length of 26, it prints the modified string; otherwise, it prints -1. The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, as it ensures that the final string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the program, and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not handled by the code.
