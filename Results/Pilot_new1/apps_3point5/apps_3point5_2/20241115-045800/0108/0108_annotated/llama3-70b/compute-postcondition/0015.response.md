Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, and `char` is also not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next character in the alphabet**
