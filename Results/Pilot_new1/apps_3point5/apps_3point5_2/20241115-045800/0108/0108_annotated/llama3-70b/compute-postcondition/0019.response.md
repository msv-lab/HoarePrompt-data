Example Answer:
`s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation. The variable `char` is updated to hold the next character in the alphabet after the original value of `char`. 
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next two characters in the alphabet, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`**
