Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The initial state of `res` contains the first character in the alphabet. Therefore, after execution, the string `res` will have the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`. 
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`**
