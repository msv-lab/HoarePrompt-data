According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet and `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the first character of `s` should be such that the previous character in the alphabet is equal to `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`**
