Output State: **If `s` contains at least one character, after the loop finishes `res` will contain the characters in `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time, `s` will be an empty string, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`, and `alphabet` contains the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`. If `s` is an empty string initially, the values of all variables will remain unchanged**
