Output State: **If `s` contains at least one character, `res` will contain the characters in `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time. The loop will continue until there are no more occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `s` is empty or `char` is not found in `s`, the loop will not execute. After the loop finishes, `s` will be modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` will contain the characters in `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time, and `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`.**
