According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, the new first character in `s` must be the next character in the alphabet after the previous first character. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet**
