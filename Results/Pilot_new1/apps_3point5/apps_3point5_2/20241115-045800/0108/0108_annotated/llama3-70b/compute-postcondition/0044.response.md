Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` from the user and iterates over the alphabet incrementing each character in `s` by one. If the length of the resulting string is 26, it prints the modified string; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty, it directly prints -1. The function operates on a string `s` containing lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5.**
