Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to the end of `res`, so the new value of `res` will contain the next two characters in the alphabet followed by `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next two characters in the alphabet followed by `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in the updated `s`.
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next two characters in the alphabet followed by `char`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in the updated `s`**
