Example Answer:
The variable `target_len` is assigned the length of the string `target`. The value of `target` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `target_len` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)**
