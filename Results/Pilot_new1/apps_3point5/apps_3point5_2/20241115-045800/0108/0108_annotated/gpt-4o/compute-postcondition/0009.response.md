Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than `target_len` and `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than `target_len` and `j` is incremented by 1**
