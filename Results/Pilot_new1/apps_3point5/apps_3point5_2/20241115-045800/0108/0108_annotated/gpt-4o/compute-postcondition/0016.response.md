According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 and `j` may have been incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than the length of `s` and has been incremented by 1, `j` is less than `target_len` and may have been incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**.
