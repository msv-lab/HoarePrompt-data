Postcondition: ***If the loop executes fully, `s` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`. If the loop does not execute at all, `s` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. In either case, if `j` is equal to `target_len`, the program prints `target`, otherwise it prints -1.***
