According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 1 or 0 depending on the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `s`, and `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than `target_len`**
