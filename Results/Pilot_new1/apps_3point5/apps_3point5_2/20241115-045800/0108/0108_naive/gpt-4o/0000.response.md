Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates over the input string and the target alphabet string to check if the input string can be converted to contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. It increments the index of the target alphabet string only when a match is found in the input string. If the index reaches the length of the target string, it means the input string can be converted to contain the English alphabet as a subsequence, and it prints the target alphabet string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases.
