Example Answer:
`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its previous value and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `num`, and `MOD` are not provided, so the output state is: `total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r` are integers.
Output State: **`total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r` are integers**
