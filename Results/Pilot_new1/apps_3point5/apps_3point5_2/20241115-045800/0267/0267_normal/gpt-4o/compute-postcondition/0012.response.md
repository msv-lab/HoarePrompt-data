Output State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is the starting value, `r` is the ending value. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0.**
