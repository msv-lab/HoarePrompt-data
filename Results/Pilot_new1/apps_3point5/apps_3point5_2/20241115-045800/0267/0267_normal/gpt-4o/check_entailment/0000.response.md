Based on the code and the problem description, the program seems to be correct.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`, as described in the output description.

The function `func_2` iterates through the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive, and for each number in that range, it checks if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits by calling `func_1`. If the condition is met, it adds the number to the `total_sum` and takes the modulo of `MOD`. The final result is then returned. The code seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is: **True**.
