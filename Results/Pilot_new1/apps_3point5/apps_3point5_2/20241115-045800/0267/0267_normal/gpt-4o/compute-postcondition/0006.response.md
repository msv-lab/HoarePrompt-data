Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the current value of `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, so the output state is: `total_sum` is updated based on the calculation `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the calculation `(total_sum + num) % MOD`**
