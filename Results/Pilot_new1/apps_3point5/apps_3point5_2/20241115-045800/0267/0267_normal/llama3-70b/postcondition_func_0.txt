The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. However, the functionality described in the annotations is incomplete as it does not specify what the count function does or how it handles edge cases such as missing values in the dictionary dp.
