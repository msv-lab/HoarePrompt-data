According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously computed values, `(n, k)` is not a key in `dp`, and the program returns 0 as the output. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously computed values, `(n, k)` is not a key in `dp`, and the program returns 0 as the output, `i` is 1**
