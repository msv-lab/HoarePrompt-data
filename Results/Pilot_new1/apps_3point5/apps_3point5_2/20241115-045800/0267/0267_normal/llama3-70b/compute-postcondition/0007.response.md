Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store previously computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, the program returns the corresponding value stored in dp. Otherwise, n is less than 10 to the power of k, and the program returns 0 as the output.**
