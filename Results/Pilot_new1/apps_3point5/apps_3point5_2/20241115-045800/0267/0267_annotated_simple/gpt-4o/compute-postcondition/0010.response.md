Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true. Here, `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. The overall state after the if statement executes covers the case where `total_sum` is updated based on the condition and the values of `num` and `l`.***
