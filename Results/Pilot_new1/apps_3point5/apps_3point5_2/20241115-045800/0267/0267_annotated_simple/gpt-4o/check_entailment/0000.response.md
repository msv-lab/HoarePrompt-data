Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function correctly determines if a given number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
2. The `func_2` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It iterates through the range [l, r] and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition specified in `func_1`. The sum is calculated modulo `MOD`.
3. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
4. The logic of the program is sound and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not produce the expected output.
