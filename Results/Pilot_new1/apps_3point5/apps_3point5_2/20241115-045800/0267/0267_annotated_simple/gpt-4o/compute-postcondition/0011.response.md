According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, where `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `num` is equal to `(l + 2) + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.**
