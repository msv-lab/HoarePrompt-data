The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] for which func_1(num, k) returns true, modulo MOD. If l > r, the total_sum remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, calculate the sum of numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition of func_1(num, k) returning true, and return the sum modulo MOD. If l > r, the total_sum remains 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts integers l, r, and k. It calculates the sum of numbers in the range [l, r] for which func_1(num, k) returns true, modulo MOD. If l > r, total_sum remains 0.**
