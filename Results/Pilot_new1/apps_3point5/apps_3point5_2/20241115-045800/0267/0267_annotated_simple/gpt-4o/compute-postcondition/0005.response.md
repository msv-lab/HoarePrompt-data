According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. After the execution of the if statement, `total_sum` is updated to the new value calculated by `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` should be `l+1`, and `total_sum` should be updated accordingly.
State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
