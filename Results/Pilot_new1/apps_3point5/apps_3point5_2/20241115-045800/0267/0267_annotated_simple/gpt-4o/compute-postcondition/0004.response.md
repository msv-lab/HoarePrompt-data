Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. After the execution of the if statement, `total_sum` is updated to the new value calculated by `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. All initial conditions are retained and the program state is consistent with the defined constraints.***
