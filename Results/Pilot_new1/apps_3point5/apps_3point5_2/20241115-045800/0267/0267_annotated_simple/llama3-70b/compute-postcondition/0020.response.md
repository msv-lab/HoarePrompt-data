Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated to 9 plus the sum of a series of calculations involving 9s and powers of 10 based on the values of n and k. The final value of dp[n, k] is obtained by performing a modulo operation with MOD. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
