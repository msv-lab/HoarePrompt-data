Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines two functions, `func_1` and `count`, to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The program uses dynamic programming to store and reuse previously calculated values, which helps in optimizing the computation. The logic within the functions seems to correctly implement the problem description by considering different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`. Additionally, the program calculates the result modulo `998244353` as required. Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles the given problem description effectively.
