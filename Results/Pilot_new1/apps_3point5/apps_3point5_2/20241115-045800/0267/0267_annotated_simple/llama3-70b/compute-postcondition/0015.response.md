Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `i` do not affect the calculation directly. After the execution, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression provided.
Output State: **The updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression provided**
