Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, then the program returns the value stored at that key. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] will be updated based on the provided formula in the else block. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] will be updated according to the formula involving a loop and modulo operation. If k is 1 or less, dp[n, k] will remain 9. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
