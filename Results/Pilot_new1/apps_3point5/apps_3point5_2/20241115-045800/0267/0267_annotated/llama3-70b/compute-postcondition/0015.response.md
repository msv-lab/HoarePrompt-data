Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by adding the result of the expression on the right-hand side. The value of i is 3, so 10 ** (i - 1) is 100, and 10 ** (k - i) is 10 ** (k - 3). Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with updated dp[n, k], i is 3.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with updated dp[n, k], i is 3**
