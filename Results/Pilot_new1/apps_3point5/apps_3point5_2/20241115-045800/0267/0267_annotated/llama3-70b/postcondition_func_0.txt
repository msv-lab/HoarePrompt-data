The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k, and returns the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. However, the actual implementation of the count function, the constraints that l, r, and k need to satisfy, and the value of MOD are not provided in the annotated code. It is assumed that the count function correctly calculates the count based on the parameters passed to it.
