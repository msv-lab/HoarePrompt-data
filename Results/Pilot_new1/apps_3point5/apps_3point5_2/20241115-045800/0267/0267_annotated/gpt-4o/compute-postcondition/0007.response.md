Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The postcondition covers all cases where `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`, ensuring that the final value of `total_sum` adheres to the constraints and updates based on the current state and function evaluation.***
