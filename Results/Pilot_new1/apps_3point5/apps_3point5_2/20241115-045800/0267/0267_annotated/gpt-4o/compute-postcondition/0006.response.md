Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated to be `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`. The new value of `total_sum` will depend on the previous value of `total_sum` and `num`, and the result will be constrained within the range of MOD. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is an updated integer based on the previous state and constraints.
Output State: **`total_sum` is an updated integer based on the previous state and constraints**
