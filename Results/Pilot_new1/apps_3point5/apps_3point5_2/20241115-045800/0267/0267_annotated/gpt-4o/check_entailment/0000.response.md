Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions. 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if the number of unique digits in a given integer `n` is less than or equal to a specified value `k`.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits by iterating over the range and using `func_1` to filter the numbers.

Both functions align with the problem description provided. Function 1 correctly determines the count of unique digits in a number, and Function 2 correctly calculates the sum of numbers meeting the specified criteria. The examples provided in the problem description are also covered by the code logic. Therefore, the code is correct.
