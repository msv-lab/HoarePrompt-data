Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines the modulo value as 998244353.
2. The function func_1(n, k) correctly checks if the number n has at most k different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to k.
3. The function func_2(l, r, k) correctly iterates through the range from l to r (inclusive), checks if each number has at most k different digits using func_1, and calculates the total sum modulo MOD.
4. The input is correctly read and passed to the func_2 function for processing.
5. The output is correctly printed.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
