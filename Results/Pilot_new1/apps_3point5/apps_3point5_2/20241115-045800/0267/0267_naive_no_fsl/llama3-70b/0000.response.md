Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function uses a nested function `count` to calculate the count of numbers that satisfy the condition. The main function then calculates the sum by subtracting the count for $l-1$ from the count for $r$ and takes the result modulo $998244353$.

The implementation of the `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in the given range. The formula used in the `count` function is based on the observation that for each position in the number, we can choose from 1 to 9 digits (excluding 0) such that the number has at most $k$ different digits.

The program reads input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result, which is the sum of numbers satisfying the condition. The logic and calculations in the program align with the problem description, and the provided examples also produce the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
