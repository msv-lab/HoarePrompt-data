Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of even length between 2 and 1000, `n` is an even integer. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This covers all cases where the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, leading to `is_spalindrome` being set to False.***
