According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of even length between 2 and 1000, and `n` is an even integer. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value, which is the current value of `i` plus 1, and `is_spalindrome` should still be True.
State: **`s` is a string of even length between 2 and 1000, `n` is an even integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `is_spalindrome` is True**
