The function `func` reads a string `s` from input, calculates its length `n`, and checks if `s` is a palindrome. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK', otherwise it prints 'NIE'. The function does not accept any parameters. The code operates on a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. The function handles both even and odd length strings for palindrome checking.
