Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of string `s` using the `len()` function. As `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` will be an integer representing the length of the string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`**
