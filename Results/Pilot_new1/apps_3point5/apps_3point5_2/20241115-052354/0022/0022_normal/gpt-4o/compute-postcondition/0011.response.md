According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 2, i is 3**
