Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters. It calculates the length of the string `s` and iterates through half of the string comparing characters at symmetric positions to determine if the string is a palindrome. If the characters at symmetric positions are not equal, the function returns False. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute. **
