Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to check if the given string `s` is symmetric about its middle. It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character in the second half. If there is a mismatch, it returns False, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True.

The implementation correctly follows the problem description by checking for symmetry about the middle of the string. The logic used in the function is accurate and covers all potential cases where the string may or may not be an "s-palindrome". The program also reads the input string, calls the function, and prints the output "TAK" or "NIE" accordingly. 

Since the program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and the logic is correct, the correctness of the program is evaluated as True.
