Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This condition covers the scenario where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` are not equal, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome.***
