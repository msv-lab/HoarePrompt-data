According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited.
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`.**
