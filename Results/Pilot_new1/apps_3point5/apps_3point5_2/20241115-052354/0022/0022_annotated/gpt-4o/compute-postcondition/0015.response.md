Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It compares characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the middle. If any pair of characters at corresponding indices is not equal, the function returns False. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns True. If the length of string `s` is odd, the loop won't execute due to integer division, and the function will return True.**
