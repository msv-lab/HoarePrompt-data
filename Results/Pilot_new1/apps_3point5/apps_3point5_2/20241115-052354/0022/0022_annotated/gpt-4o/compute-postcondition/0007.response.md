Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This covers all cases where the characters at the specified indices do not match, ensuring the function returns False in those scenarios.***
