Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly checks if a string is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing each character with its corresponding character in the second half. If at any point a mismatch is found, the program returns False, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True.

The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
