Output State: **If the characters at symmetric positions in the string do not match, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If the characters at all symmetric positions match, then `s` is a palindrome, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
