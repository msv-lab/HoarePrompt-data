Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is terminated. This covers all cases where the characters at symmetric positions in the string do not match, resulting in `is_spalindrome` being set to False and the loop or if statement being exited.***
