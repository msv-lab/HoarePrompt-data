Postcondition: ***`s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. In all other cases, the program continues without any changes to the initial state of variables.***
