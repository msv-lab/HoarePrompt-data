Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the length of `s`, which can be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`**
