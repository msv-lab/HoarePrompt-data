Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If there exists at least one index `i` such that `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return False.***
