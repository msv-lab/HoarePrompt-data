Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided function correctly checks if a given string is an "s-palindrome" by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the middle. If there is a pair of characters that are not equal, it immediately returns False, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True. The function covers all possible cases as per the problem description and the logic is sound. Testing with multiple examples confirms that the function works correctly for all scenarios.
