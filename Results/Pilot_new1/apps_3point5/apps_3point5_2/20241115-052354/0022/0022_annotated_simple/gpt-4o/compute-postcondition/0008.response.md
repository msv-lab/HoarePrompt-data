According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n // 2` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i`.

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. Since `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i`, the condition `s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]` is not met. Therefore, the next iteration will be executed successfully with the adjusted value of `i`.

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i`]**
