According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute one more time, the loop needs to continue, so `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`. Since the loop compares characters from the start and end of the string, the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` need to be equal for the loop to continue. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n // 2` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`**
