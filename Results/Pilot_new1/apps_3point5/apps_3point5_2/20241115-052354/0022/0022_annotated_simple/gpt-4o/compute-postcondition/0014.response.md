The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. If the length of string `s` is at least 2, the function checks if the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i are equal for i less than n // 2. If there exists at least one pair of characters that are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of string `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal. If all pairs of characters are equal, it returns True. If there exists at least one pair of characters that are not equal, it returns False.
