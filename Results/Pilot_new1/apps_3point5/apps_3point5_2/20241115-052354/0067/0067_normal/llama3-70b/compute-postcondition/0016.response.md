Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100 and x is not greater than y + z. If x < y, the program prints '-'. If x == y and z == 0, the program prints '0'. If x == y and z != 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'. In all cases, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.***
