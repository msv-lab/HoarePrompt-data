Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input, and based on their values, it outputs different messages. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z equals 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'. The function does not handle the cases mentioned in the annotations about equality of numbers or their relationships, and instead, it only focuses on the specific conditions mentioned above.**
