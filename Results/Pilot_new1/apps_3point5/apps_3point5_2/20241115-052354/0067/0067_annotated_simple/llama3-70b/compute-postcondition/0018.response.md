The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates without any input parameters. The function returns the sum of three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. The sum is calculated by adding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` together. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the sum of three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.
