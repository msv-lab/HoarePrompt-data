Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `x`, `y`, and `z` will take integer inputs separated by spaces. Since the values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state will be the updated values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after input.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100 based on user input**
