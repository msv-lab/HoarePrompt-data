Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100 based on user input. min_upvotes is assigned the value of x. max_upvotes is assigned the value of x + z. min_downvotes is assigned the value of y. max_downvotes is assigned the value of y + z. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, the program prints '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. The program always prints either '-', '+', or '?', covering all possible scenarios based on the input values of x, y, and z.***
