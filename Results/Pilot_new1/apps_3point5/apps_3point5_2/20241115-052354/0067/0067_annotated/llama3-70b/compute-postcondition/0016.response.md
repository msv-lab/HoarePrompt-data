Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100 and x is not greater than y + z. If x is less than y, the program prints '-'. If x is equal to y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'.***
