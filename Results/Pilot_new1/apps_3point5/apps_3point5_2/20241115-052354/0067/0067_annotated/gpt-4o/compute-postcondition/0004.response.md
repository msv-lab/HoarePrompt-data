Example Answer:
max_downvotes is assigned the value of y + z. The values of y and z are unknown, so the output state is: min_upvotes is assigned the value of x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is assigned the value of y, max_downvotes is y + z.
Output State: **min_upvotes is assigned the value of x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is assigned the value of y, max_downvotes is y + z**
