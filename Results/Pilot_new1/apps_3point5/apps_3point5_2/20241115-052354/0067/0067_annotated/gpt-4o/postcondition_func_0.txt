The function `func` reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. If neither condition is met, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
