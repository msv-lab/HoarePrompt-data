Example Answer: 
The character `c` is added to the end of the string `n`. Since `n` is initially an empty string, after execution, `n` will be the character `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c`, and the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c`, and the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`**
