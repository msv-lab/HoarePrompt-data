According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of the characters. If there are more permutations left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`. To execute the loop one more time, the `candidate` should still be a valid number with respect to `is_valid_number`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`**
