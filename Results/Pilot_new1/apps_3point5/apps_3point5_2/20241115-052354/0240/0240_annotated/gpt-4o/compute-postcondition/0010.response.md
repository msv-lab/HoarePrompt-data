Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The value of `perm` is unknown, but it is assumed to be a valid number according to `is_valid_number`. Therefore, the output state is: `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`**
