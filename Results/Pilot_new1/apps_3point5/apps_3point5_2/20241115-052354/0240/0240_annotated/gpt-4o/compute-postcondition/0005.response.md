According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the validity of the `candidate` string resulting from joining `perm` and passing it to `is_valid_number` function with `sub`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then `candidate` is yielded. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `candidate` is a string resulting from joining `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, the next `candidate` string should be generated from the next `perm` and it should be a valid number according to `is_valid_number`. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `candidate` string to be a valid number according to `is_valid_number`.

State: **`candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`**
