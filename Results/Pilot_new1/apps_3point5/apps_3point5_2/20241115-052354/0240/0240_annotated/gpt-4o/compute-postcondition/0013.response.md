According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more permutations left to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation needs to be generated.
State: **`candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number` and the next permutation needs to be generated**
