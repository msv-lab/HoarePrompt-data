Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to find all the characters that are present in `t`. It then appends `t` to the end of the filtered characters to form the smallest possible integer `n`. The program seems to be handling the problem description correctly by finding the smallest possible integer `n` based on the provided substring `t`. The logic appears to be sound and there are no obvious cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
