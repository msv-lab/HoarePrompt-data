Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` contains `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. The next character in `s` is considered for the next iteration of the loop.***
