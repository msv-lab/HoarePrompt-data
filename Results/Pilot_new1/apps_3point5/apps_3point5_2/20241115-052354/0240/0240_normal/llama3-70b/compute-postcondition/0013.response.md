Output State: `s` is a string representing the remaining part of the large integer after processing the current character, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set` concatenated in the order they appear. If `t_set` is empty, `n` remains an empty string. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string.
