Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the joined permutation of the characters in `perm`. The variables `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in `perm`**
