According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `permutations`. The loop will execute if `chars` is not an empty string. Since `sub` is not used inside the loop, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `chars` should not be an empty string.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n**
