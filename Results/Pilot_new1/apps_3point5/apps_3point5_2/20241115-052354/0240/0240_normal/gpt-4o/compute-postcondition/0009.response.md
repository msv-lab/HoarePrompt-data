According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the characters in the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation should be generated. Therefore, the state of the program variables should be adjusted such that the next permutation is considered.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.**
