According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. To execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. This means adjusting the state to reflect the next permutation of `chars` and ensuring that `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string with the next permutation, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub`**
