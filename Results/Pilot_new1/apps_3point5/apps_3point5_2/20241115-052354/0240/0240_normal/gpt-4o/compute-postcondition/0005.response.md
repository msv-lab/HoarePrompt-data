According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more permutations of the characters in `chars` to generate. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in `perm`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next permutation of characters in `chars` needs to be generated.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`**
