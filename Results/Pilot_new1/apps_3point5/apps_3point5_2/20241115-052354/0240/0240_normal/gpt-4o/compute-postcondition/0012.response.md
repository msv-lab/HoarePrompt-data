Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`, then the program yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Ensure all edge cases including valid and invalid scenarios are considered.***
