Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
