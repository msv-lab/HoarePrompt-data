Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`**
