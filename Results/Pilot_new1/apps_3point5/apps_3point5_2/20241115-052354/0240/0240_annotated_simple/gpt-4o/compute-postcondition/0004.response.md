Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
