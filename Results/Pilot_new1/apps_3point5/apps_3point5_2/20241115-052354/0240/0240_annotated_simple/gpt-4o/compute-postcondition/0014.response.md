Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables.**
