Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines three functions to handle the logic of finding the smallest possible initial integer n based on the received string and the remembered substring.
2. The functions utilize Counter objects to efficiently handle character counts and permutations to generate possible numbers.
3. The program iterates through all possible permutations of the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring and checks if the generated number is valid based on the remembered substring and length.
4. The program then returns the smallest valid number found.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles the scenario where Vasya could pass multiple valid initial integers to Kate. 
6. Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality.
