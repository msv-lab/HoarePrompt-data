Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a sequence of digits, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of `chars`. It generates all possible permutations of `chars`, constructs numbers from these permutations, and yields those numbers that are valid according to the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true for a candidate number, it is yielded by the function. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the function does not yield any numbers.**
