Output State: **If `t` is an empty string, the loop will not execute and `n` will remain an empty string. If `t` is not empty and there are common characters between `s` and `t`, then `n` will contain all those common characters. `s` and `t` remain unchanged, and `t_set` is a set created from `t`.**
