Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m. `current_counts` is updated with the incremented value. `left` is 0 and `right` is n. If all the counts of lightsabers in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts` for each color, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
