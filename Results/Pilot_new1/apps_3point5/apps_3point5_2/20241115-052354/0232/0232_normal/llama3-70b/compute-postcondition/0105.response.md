Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1. The values in `window_counts` remain equal to their corresponding values in `counts` after sorting. `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `j` was not equal to `n-1` in the previous iteration, it is incremented by 1. If `j` was equal to `n-1`, then `n` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
