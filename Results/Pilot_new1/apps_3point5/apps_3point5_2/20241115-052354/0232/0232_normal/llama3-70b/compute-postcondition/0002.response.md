Example Answer:
The list `counts` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The initial state `colors` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input values, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input values, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values**
