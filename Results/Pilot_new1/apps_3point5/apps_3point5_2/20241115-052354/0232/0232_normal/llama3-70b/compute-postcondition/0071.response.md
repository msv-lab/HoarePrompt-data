Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, `found` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
