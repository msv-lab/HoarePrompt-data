Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True. If `color` was not in `window_counts` initially, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. The program breaks out of the loop after the if condition is met.***
