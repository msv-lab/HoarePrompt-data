Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, and `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the increment operation. If the color is not already present in `color_counts`, then it is added to the dictionary with a value of 0. This ensures that all colors in the input list are accounted for in the dictionary.***
