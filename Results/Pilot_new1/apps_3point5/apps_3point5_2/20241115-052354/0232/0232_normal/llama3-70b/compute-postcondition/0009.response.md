According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `colors` list. If the list has at least 2 colors, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 color. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 colors.
State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, `color_counts` is a dictionary**
