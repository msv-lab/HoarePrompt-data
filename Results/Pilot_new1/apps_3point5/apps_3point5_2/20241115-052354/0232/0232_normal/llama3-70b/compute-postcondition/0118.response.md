Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `n`, `colors` is a non-empty list with elements, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, and `found` is True, then the loop breaks. After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color encountered in the loop has an incremented count. `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute.***
