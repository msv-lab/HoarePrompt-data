Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The dictionary `window_counts` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 if `color` was in `window_counts`, otherwise `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1; `found` is True.
Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 if `color` was in `window_counts`, otherwise `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1; `found` is True**
