Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value corresponding to `color` is incremented by 1. All values in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `counts` after sorting. `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
