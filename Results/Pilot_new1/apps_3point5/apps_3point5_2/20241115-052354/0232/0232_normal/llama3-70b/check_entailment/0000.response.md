Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for the number of colors, color counts, and color occurrences.
- It calculates the maximum number of adjacent cells in a grid that can be painted with the same color based on the given constraints.
- The code iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved within that interval.
- If such an interval is found, it sets the 'found' flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if a valid interval is found, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given constraints.
