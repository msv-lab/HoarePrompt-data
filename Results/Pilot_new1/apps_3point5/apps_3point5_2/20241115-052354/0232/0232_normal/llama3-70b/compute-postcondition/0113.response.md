Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 if `color` was in `window_counts`, otherwise `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True and the loop is terminated.***
