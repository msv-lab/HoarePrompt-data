According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` may not have the same values as `desired_counts`, `left` is at a value where at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, the `right` variable needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`current_counts` may not have the same values as `desired_counts`, `left` is at a value where at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, `right` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0**
