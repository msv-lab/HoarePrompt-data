Output State: **If all colors in `current_counts` have the same values as the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, `current_counts` remains a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is at a value where at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `current_counts` remains a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.**
