Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and all colors in `current_counts` have values greater than or equal to the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`. If all colors in `current_counts` have the same values as the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
