According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition that all colors in `current_counts` have values greater than or equal to the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`. At the end of the last iteration, all colors in `current_counts` have values greater than or equal to the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time. No states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and all colors in `current_counts` have values greater than or equal to the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`**
