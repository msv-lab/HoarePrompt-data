Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The input is expected to be two positive integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `m` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers. The list of colors contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The list of desired counts of lightsabers of each color contains m integers such that the sum of all counts is between 1 and n, inclusive.**
