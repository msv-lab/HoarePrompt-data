Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, processes the colors and their counts, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. If such an interval is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if `found` is True, indicating that an interval with the prescribed color counts exists, and "NO" otherwise. The implementation follows the problem description and logic correctly.
