Postcondition: ***found is a boolean representing whether all counts in window_counts match the target counts in counts. n is greater than or equal to i+1, m is a positive integer, counts contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, colors is a non-empty list of colors, color_counts contains the counts of each color, i is 1, window_counts is updated with the necessary information. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0. The program will exit the loop if all counts in window_counts match the target counts in counts. If n is less than or equal to i, the loop does not execute and found remains True. If found is True, the loop is exited.***
