Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `color_counts[color]` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors with more colors left to iterate over. If the color is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is updated to 0 for that specific color, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.
