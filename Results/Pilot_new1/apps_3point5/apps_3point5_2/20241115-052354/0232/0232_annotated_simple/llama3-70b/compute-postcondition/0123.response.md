Functionality: **The function reads input data regarding the distribution of lightsabers among Jedi Knights based on desired colors. It then iterates through the colors to determine if each Jedi Knight receives the correct number of lightsabers. If the distribution is successful, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ensures each Jedi Knight receives at least one lightsaber of the desired color.**
