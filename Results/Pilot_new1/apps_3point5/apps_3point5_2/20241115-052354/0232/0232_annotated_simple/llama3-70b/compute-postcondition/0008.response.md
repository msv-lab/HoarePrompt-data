Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `color_counts[color]` depends on the color provided. If the color is not in `color_counts`, it is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, and `color_counts[color]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, and `color_counts[color]` is updated accordingly**
