Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values and then iterates through the list of colors to find a contiguous interval where the desired counts of lightsabers of each color match the given counts. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the current counts of each color and adjusts the window accordingly. The program returns 'YES' if it finds an interval that satisfies the conditions, otherwise it returns 'NO'. 
The logic of the program seems correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
