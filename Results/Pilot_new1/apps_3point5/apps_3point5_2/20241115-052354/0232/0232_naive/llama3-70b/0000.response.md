Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in appropriate variables. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the counts of lightsabers in that interval match the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if a matching interval is found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic of the program is correct and it covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
