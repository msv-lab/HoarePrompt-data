Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values, calculates the color counts of the Jedi Knights, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if the desired color counts exist within that interval. If the counts match, it sets the flag `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if `found` is True, otherwise it prints "NO". The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all possible cases to determine if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists.
