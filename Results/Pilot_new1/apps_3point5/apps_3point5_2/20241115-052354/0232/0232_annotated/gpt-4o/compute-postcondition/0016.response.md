According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is the index where the loop stops, `n` is greater than 0. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n-1`.
State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0**
