Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_counts` is a defaultdict with initial values of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. After execution, the count of the color at index `right` is increased by 1 in `current_counts`. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
