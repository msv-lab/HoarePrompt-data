Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is the index where the loop stops, `n` is greater than 0. If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. If the loop does not execute at all, the function does not return 'YES`.**
