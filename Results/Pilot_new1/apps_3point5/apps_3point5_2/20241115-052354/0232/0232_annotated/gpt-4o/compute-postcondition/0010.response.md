Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and at least one color in `current_counts` has a count less than the desired count for that color. If all colors in `current_counts` have counts equal to their corresponding desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
