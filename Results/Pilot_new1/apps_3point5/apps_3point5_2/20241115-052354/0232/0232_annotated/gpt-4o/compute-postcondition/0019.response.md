Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the dictionary `current_counts` is incremented by 1. The loop stops at index `left`, and `right` is less than `n`. The value of `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0**
