According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is within the range of `n`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. In this case, `n` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to start. So, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with initial values of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
