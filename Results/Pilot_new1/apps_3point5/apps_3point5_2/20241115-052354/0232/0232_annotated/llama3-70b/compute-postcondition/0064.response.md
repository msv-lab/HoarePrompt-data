Postcondition: ***After the execution of the code, the values of `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` set to 0. `found` is True, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. Additionally, the value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The counts of all colors in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts specified in `counts`.***
