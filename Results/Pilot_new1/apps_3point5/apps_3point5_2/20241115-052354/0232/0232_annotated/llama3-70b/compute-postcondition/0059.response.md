Postcondition: ***`colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` set to 0. `found` is False, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
