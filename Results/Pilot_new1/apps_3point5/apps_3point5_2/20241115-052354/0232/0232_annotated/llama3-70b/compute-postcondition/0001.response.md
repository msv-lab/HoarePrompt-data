Example Answer: 
The list `colors` is assigned the values entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in the list `colors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values**
