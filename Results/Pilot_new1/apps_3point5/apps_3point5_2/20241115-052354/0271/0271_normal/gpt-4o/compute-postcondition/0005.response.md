Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n` plus `10 - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which can be 6, 7, 8, or 9. The value of `result` will be dependent on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which can be 6, 7, 8, or 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`**
