Example Answer:
If the value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If the value of `remainder` is 6, 7, 8, or 9, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer and the value of `remainder` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Based on the value of `remainder`, the value of `result` is calculated accordingly. After executing the code, the output state will be based on the calculated value of `result`.
Output State: **Based on the calculated value of `result`**
