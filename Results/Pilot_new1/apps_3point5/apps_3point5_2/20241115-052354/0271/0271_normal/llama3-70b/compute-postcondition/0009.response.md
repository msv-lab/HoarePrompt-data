Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, the program behaves based on the remainder of n divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n without the units place. If the remainder is greater than 5, the program prints n rounded up to the nearest tens place.***
