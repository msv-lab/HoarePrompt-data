Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is not divisible by 10. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then the value of n without the ones place digit is printed. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, then a multiple of 10 is printed, ensuring that all possible cases are handled within the given constraints.***
