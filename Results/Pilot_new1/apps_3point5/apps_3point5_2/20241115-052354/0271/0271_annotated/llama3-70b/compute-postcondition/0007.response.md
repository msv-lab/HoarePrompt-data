Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is larger than 5, the sum will always be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, and the result is always a multiple of 10.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5, and the result is always a multiple of 10**
