Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the function prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, the function prints either n - (n % 10) if the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, or n + (10 - n % 10) if the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5. This covers all possible scenarios for the value of n within the specified constraints.***
