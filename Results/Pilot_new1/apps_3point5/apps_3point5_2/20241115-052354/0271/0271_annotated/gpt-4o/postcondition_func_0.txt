The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on that remainder, adjusts the value of `result`. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`). The function then prints the final value of `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
