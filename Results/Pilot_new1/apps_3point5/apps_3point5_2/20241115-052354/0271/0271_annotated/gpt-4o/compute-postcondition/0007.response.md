Example Answer:
If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is between 6 and 9, then `result` is calculated as the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`). The value of `result` depends on the values of `n` and `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, and the value of `result` is based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, and the value of `result` is based on the conditions mentioned**
