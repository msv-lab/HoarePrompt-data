According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be one more than its current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d`**
