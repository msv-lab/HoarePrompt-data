Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` will contain tuples `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d` for each iteration. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `buses` will remain an empty list. `ans` is -1**
