Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers, so they will be within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5**
