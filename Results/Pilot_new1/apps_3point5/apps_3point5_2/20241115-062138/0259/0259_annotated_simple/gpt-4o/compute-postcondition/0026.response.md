Postcondition: ***Output State: `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time, `i` is the next route index, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of routes, `s_i` and `d_i` are integers assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i + 1]`. If `s_i` >= `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`.***
