Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time. `i` is an integer indicating the current route index. `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of routes. `s_i` and `d_i` are integers assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to be the minimum of the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to be the route index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum `wait_time`. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct updating of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the conditions specified.***
