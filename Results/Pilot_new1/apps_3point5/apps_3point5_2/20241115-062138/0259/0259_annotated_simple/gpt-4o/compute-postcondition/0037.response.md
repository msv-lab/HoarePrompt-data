According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `i`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` remain the same. However, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` may need to be updated based on the condition specified in the postcondition. If `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` should be updated to the new value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` should be updated to `i + 1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `i`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` remain the same**
