The function func_1 accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the current time t. The chosen_route variable keeps track of the route with the minimum wait time. At the end, the function returns the integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the function returns -1 indicating no route chosen.
