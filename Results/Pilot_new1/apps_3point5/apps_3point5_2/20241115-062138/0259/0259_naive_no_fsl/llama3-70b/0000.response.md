Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station, then iterates through each bus route to calculate the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus of each route. It then determines which bus route Serval will use based on the minimum time difference calculated. The program outputs the correct bus route that Serval will take. 

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and handles them correctly. Therefore, the code is correct.
