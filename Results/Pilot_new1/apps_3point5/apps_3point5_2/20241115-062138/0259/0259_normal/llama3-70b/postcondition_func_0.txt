The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and schedules of buses. It then calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus based on the input schedules and prints the index of the bus with the minimum waiting time. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop for reading bus schedules does not execute. The function does not have any return value.
