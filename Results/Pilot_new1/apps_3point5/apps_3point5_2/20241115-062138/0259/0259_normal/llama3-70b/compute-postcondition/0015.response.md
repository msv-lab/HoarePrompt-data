According to the code, the loop will execute if `buses` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least one tuple. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0, and the tuple `(s, d)` will be the first tuple in the `buses` list. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
