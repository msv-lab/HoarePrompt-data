Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The variables `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]**
