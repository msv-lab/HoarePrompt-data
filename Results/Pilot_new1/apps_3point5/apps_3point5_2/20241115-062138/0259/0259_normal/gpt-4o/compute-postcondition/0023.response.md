Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i+1]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The postcondition accounts for all scenarios where `wait_time` can be either 0 or computed based on the provided formula.***
