Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all scenarios regarding the values of `min_wait_time`, `n`, and the resulting `wait_time`, ensuring proper handling of edge cases and calculations involving these variables.***
