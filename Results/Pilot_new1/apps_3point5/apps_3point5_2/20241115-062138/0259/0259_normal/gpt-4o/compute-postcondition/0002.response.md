According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and `min_wait_time` should be set to a finite positive value, and `chosen_route` should be set to a valid route value.
State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0**
