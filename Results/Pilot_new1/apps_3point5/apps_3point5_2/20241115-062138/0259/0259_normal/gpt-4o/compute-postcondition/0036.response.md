Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This postcondition ensures that the values of `min_wait_time`, `n`, `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment, covering all scenarios and edge cases related to these variables.***
