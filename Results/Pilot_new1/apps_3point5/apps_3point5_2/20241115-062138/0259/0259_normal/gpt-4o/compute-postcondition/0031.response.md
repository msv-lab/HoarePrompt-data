Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are not provided in the initial state, so the calculation cannot be performed. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
