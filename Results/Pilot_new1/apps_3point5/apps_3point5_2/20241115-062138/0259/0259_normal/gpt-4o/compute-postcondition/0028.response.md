Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `bus_routes` are not provided in the initial state, so the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
