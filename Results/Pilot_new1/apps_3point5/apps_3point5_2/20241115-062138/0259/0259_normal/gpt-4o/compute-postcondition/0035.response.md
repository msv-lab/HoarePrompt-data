Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is a variable. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen_route`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`**
