Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time, `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of bus_routes[i]. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all scenarios where the waiting time is either 0 or calculated based on the given formula.***
