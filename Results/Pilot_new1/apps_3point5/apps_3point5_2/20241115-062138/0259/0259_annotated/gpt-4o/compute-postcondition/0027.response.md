According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes. The variables `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained, where `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of bus_routes[i]. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. `min_wait_time` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes.
2. `chosen_route` should be updated to `i + 1`.
3. `s_i` and `d_i` should be updated based on the next bus route values.
4. If the next `s_i` value is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` should be calculated accordingly.
5. The values of `n` and `i` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1**
