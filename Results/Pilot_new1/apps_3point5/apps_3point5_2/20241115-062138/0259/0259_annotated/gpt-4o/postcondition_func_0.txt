The function func_1 accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes list to calculate the minimum waiting time for each route based on the start time and time interval. It then returns the route number with the minimum waiting time. If n is 0 or negative, the function does not execute the loop and returns -1 as the chosen route.
