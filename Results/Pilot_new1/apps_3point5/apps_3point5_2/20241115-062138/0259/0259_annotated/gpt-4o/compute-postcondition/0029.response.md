Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, and `i` remain the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
