Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is the difference between `s_i` and `t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), `wait_time` is 0. If `s_i` is less than `t` and ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
