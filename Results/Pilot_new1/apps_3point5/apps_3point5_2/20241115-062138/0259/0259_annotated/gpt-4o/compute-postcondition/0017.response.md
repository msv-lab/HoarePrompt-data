According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` may have been updated based on the conditions provided. The initial values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the updated `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` values, along with the current values of `s_i` and `d_i`.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes. `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time. The initial values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained.**
