Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly calculates the minimum waiting time for each bus route and returns the route number with the minimum waiting time. The annotations also align with the problem description, providing additional clarity on how the code operates. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are covered by the code, ensuring that the correct output is generated in those cases. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
