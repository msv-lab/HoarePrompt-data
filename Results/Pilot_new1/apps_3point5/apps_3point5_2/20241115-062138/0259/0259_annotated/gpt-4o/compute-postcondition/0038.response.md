Output State: 
- `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes. 
- `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time. 
- If `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1. 
- The initial values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained. 
- If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t. 
- If `s_i` is less than `t` and ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), `wait_time` is 0. 
- If `s_i` is less than `t` and ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. 
- If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, while `chosen_route` remains -1.
