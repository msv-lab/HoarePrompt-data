According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `n` is the previous value of `n + 1`**
