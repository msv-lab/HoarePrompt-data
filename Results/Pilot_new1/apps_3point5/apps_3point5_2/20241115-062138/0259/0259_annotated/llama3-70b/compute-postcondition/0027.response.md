Example Answer: 
The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `t`, `s`, and `d` are positive integers. The previous values of `t`, `s`, and `d` are known, so the value of `time` can be calculated based on those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is increased by 1, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is increased by 1, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`**
