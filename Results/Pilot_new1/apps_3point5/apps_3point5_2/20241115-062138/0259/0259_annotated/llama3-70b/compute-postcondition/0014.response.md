Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` added in each iteration, `s` is an integer assigned the first input value in each iteration, `d` is an integer assigned the second input value in each iteration. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity. `ans` is -1.**
