Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. Since `n` and `t` are positive integers, the values are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified range**
