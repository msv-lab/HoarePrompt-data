Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers. `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. `i` is the index of the last tuple. `s`, `d`, `time` are calculated values based on the given conditions. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. All variables retain their initial conditions, and the overall state of the program after the if else block is executed is determined by the comparison of the calculated `time` with `min_time`, ensuring the proper updating of `min_time` and `ans`.***
