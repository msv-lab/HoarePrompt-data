Postcondition: ***ones, teens, tens are lists containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and ten to ninety respectively. n is an integer not in the range of 11 to 19. If n is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, the program returns the string representation of the tens digit of n if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, it returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens digit and the ones digit of n separated by a hyphen. The postcondition covers all cases within the specified range of n and ensures the correct representation of the number in words.***
