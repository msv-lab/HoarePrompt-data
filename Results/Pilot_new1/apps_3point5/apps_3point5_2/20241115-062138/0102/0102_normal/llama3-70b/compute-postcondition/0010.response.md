Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the number represented by the input integer `s` using the `ones` and `tens` lists. It calculates the tens place by dividing `s` by 10 and uses that index to get the corresponding string from the `tens` list. It then checks if the ones place is not zero, and if so, appends a hyphen followed by the string from the `ones` list corresponding to the ones place. Given that `s` is an input integer where 20 <= s <= 99, the output will be the number represented by `s` in words.
Output State: **output the number represented by the input integer `s` in words**
