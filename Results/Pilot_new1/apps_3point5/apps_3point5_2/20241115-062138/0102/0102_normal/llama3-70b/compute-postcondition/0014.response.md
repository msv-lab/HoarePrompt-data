Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes an integer input `s` in the range 0 to 99 and converts it to its word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the list `ones`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation from the list `teens`. For `s` between 20 and 99, it prints the word representation considering the tens and ones places. The function covers all cases within the specified range and correctly handles boundary values and edge cases.**
