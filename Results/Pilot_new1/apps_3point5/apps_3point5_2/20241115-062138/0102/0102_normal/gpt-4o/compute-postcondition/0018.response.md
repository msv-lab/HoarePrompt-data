The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n` and has the following constraints: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The function utilizes the lists ones, teens, and tens to represent numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and ten to ninety, respectively. 

After executing the function body, if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the program returns the string representation of n from the ones list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the program returns the string representation of n from the teens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 == 0, the program returns the string representing the tens digit of n from the tens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 != 0, the program concatenates the string representation of the tens digit of n from the tens list with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones digit of n from the ones list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and conditions, and return the appropriate string representation based on the rules defined for the given input values of s and n.
