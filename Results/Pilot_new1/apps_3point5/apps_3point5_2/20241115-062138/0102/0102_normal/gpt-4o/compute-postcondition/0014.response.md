Postcondition: ***s is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to ninety; n is an integer such that n is not between 11 and 19, and 10 ≤ n ≤ 99. If n % 10 == 0, the program returns the string representing the tens digit of n from the list 'tens'. If n % 10 != 0, the program concatenates the string representation of the tens digit of n from the list 'tens' with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones digit of n from the list 'ones'. This covers all possible scenarios for the given input values of s and n.***
