The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function also utilizes two lists: `ones`, containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine, and `tens`, containing string representations of tens from an empty string to ninety. 

After executing the function body, if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the `ones` list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number from the 'teens' list at index n - 10. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer `n`. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in words by combining the tens and ones place representations.

The program accurately handles all edge cases and correctly converts the given integer `n` to its corresponding word representation. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and correctly converts it to its corresponding word representation using the `ones` and `tens` lists.**
