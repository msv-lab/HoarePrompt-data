Example Answer:
The list `teens` is initialized with string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen. The initial state of `n` and `ones` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine**
