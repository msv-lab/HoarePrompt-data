Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer, the value of `x` will be 10 raised to the power of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 10 to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 10 to the power of `k`**
