The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of n multiplied by (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where multiplier is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the result of n multiplied by (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)).
