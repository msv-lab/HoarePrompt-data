Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, the possible values of `x` can range from 1 to 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100000000**
