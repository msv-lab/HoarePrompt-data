Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by 1. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is increased by 1, `(n % x)` is equal to 0, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 1, `(n % x)` is equal to 0, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
