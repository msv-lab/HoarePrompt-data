Output State: **If x is not a factor of n, the loop will execute until it finds the next multiple of x. Once the loop finishes, n will be the next multiple of x greater than the initial n, k will remain the same, x will remain the same. If x is already a factor of n, the loop will not execute and n, k, x will remain the same.**
