Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` can range from 0 to 8, the value of `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
