Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n as per the given formula. The formula is derived from the problem description and the logic used in the program is sound. The program uses the math.gcd() function to calculate the greatest common divisor which ensures that the result is the minimum positive integer x that satisfies the conditions. The program works correctly for all the provided examples and is expected to work for all potential cases as well.
