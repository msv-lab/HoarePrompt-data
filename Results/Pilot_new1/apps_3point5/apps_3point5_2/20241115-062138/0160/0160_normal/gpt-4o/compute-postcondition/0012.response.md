Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`, which contains factors of `x` with the new factor `i` added. Since `i` is one more than the previous value, the set `divisors` now includes the factor `x // i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` with the new factor `i` added, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is one more than the previous value.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` with the new factor `i` added, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is one more than the previous value**
