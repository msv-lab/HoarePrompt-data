Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, after adding `i`, `divisors` will now include `i` as one of the factors of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` including `i`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1, satisfying the conditions for the next iteration of the loop**
