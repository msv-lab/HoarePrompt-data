According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `divisors` being an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
