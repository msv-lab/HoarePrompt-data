Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1. The set `divisors` includes both the factors `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. The postcondition covers all possible cases when the if statement executes, ensuring that the set `divisors` is correctly updated with the factors of `x`.***
