Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. If gcd % i == 0, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. If i * i is not equal to gcd, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
