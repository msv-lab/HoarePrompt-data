Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the maximum of the previous value of `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by the incremented value of `i`. `gcd` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
