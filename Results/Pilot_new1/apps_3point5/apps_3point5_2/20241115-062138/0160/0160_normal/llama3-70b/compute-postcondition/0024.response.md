According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `i` less than or equal to the square root of `gcd` should still hold true. 

State: **`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1**
