According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 1 and 500. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is between 1 and 500, K is between 0 and 10^9, and `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the value of `A` at index `i+1`, i is adjusted to i+1**
