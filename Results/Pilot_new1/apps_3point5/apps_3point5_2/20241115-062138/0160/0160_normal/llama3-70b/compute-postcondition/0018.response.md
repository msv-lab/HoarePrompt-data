Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `max_divisor` and `gcd`.***
