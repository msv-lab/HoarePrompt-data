Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
