Output State: **If `gcd` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the factors of `gcd`. The loop will execute at least once if `gcd` is a perfect square, otherwise, it will not execute. After the loop execution, `max_divisor` will contain the largest factor of `gcd`, `gcd` will remain the same, and `K` can be any value between 0 and 10^9.**
