According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x` and `x // 1`, with `i` added to it and `x // i` added as divisors if `x` is divisible by `i`. The set `divisors` will be updated accordingly based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous `i`.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x` and `x // 1`, with `i` added to it and `x // i` added as divisors if `x` is divisible by `i`, where `i` is the next integer after the previous `i`**
