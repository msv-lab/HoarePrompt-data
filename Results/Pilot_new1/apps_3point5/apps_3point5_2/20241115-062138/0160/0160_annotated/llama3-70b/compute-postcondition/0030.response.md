Output State: **If N is less than 2, the loop does not execute and gcd remains the same as the initial value, max_divisor is assigned the value of gcd. If gcd is greater than or equal to 3, after the loop executes, max_divisor will be updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where max_divisor is divisible by i. If i squared is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i.**
