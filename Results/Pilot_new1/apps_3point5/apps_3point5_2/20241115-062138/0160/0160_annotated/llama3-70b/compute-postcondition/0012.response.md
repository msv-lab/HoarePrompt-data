According to the code, the loop will execute if `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `N` is assigned a value obtained from input, `K` is assigned a value obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 1, and `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`.
State: **`N` is assigned a value obtained from input, `K` is assigned a value obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**
