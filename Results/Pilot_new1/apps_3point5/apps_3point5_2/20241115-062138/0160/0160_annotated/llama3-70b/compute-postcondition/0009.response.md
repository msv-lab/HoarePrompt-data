According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the updated gcd value, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the updated gcd value, `i` is 4**
