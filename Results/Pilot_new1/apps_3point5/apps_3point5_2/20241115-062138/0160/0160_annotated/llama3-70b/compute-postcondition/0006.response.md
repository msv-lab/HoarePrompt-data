Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated by taking the gcd of the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index `2` in list `A`. The value of `i` is 2, so the element at index `2` in list `A` is accessed. The updated `gcd` value is stored back in the `gcd` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the updated gcd value, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the updated gcd value, `i` is 2**
