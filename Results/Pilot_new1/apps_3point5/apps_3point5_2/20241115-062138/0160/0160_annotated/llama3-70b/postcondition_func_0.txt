The function `func` reads input values for `N` and `K`, then reads a list of integers `A`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in `A` and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. The function then prints the maximum divisor. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
