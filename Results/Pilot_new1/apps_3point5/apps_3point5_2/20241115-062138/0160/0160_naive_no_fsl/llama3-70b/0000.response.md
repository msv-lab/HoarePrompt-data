Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases where the maximum possible positive integer needs to be computed.
