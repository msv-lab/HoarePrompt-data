According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A_i` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `x` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1. If `x % i == 0`, `divisors` is a set containing divisors of `x` with the newly added divisors `i` and `x // i`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Additionally, if `x` is a perfect square and `i` divides `x`, then the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1. If x % (i+1) == 0, divisors is a set containing divisors of x with the newly added divisors i+1 and x // (i+1)**
