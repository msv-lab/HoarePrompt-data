Example Answer:
The newly added divisor to the set `divisors` is `x // i`. Since `i` is not given in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact value of the new divisor. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is a set containing divisors of x with the newly added divisors i+1 and x // (i+1).
