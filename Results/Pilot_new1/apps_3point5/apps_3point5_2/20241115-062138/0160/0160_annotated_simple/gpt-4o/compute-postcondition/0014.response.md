According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A_i` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `x` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the next integer after the previous square root value. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current value. No other states need adjustment.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the previous square root value**
