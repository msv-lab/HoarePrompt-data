Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the set `divisors` is updated by adding the new value of `i`. The previous values of `N`, `K`, `A_i`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the previous square root value, and divisors are updated accordingly based on the new value of i.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the previous square root value, and divisors are updated accordingly based on the new value of i**
