Example Answer:
The set `divisors` has the value of `i` added to it. The value of `i` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact content of the set `divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is a set containing divisors of x with the newly added divisors i+1 and x // (i+1).
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is a set containing divisors of x with the newly added divisors i+1 and x // (i+1)**
