Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the previous square root value. If x is divisible by i, then both i and x // i are added to the set of divisors. This process covers all possible scenarios for the given input variables.***
