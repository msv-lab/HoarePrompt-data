Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and the `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`.***
