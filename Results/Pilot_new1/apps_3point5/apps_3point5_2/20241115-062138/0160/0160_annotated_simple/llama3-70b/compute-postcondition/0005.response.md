According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500. To execute one more time, `N` needs to be adjusted to N+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A**
