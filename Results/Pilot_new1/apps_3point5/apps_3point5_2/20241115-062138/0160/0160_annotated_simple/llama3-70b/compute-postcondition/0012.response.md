According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the square root of `gcd` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, so `max_divisor` must be a positive integer as well. Additionally, `i` should start from 1.
State: **`max_divisor` is a positive integer, `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
