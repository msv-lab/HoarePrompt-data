Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd % i == 0`, then `max_divisor` is set to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i != gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`.***
