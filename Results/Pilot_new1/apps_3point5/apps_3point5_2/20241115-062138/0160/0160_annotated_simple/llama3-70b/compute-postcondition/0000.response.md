Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values by mapping integers from input split by space. The values of N and K are constrained as mentioned in the precondition. Therefore, the output state is N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9**
