Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated by taking the greatest common divisor between the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`. The value of `gcd` is updated iteratively for each element in list `A`. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A**
