Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. The previous values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1**
