Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop. `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is set to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is set to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`.***
