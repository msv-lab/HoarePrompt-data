Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the distances from the ends of the array. It then calculates the maximum distance possible by considering all possible swap scenarios and outputs the result. The logic is sound and the program will always output the correct maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap.
