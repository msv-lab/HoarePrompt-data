Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of the positions of 0, n-1, 1, and n from the positions of the minimum value (1) and the maximum value (n) in the list. Finally, it prints the maximum calculated distance. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
