Example Answer: 
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is n-1. Since `n` is within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `max_pos` will be at most 99. Therefore, the value of `dist1` will be 99. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is 99**
