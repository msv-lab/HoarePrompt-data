Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the precondition states that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, the value of `n` will be within this range. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which means `a` will contain integers from 1 to `n` without repetition.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
