Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the element 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in the list `a` will be 0. Therefore, `pos1` is assigned the value 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0**
