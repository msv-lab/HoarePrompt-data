Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer. The input contains `n` distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive**
