Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 - min_pos. The values of n, min_pos, and a are already defined, so we can calculate dist4 directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - max_pos, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - min_pos.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - max_pos, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, and `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - min_pos**
