Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The variables `n`, `max_pos`, and `dist2` are affected. The previous values of `n` and `max_pos` are known, so we can calculate `dist2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of n in list `a`, and `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - max_pos.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of n in list `a`, and `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - max_pos**
