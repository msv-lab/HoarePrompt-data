Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the integer 1 in the list `a`. If 1 is present in the list `a`, then `pos1` will be assigned the index of 1 in the list `a`. If 1 is not present in the list `a`, then an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present).
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present)**
