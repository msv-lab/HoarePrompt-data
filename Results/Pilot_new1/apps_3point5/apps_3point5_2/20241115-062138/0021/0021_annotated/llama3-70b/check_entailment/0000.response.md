Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input as described in the problem statement, calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n, the minimum distance between these positions, and prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and n minus 1. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given examples. Additionally, the annotations provided do not suggest any edge cases that the code does not cover. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
