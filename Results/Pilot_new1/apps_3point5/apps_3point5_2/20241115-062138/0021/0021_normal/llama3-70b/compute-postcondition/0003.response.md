Example Answer:
The code finds the position of the integer `n` in the list `a` and assigns it to `posn`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, and `pos1` is the position of 1 in the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of distinct integers, and `pos1` is the position of 1, the code will find the position of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `pos1` is the position of 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` is the position of `n` in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `pos1` is the position of 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` is the position of `n` in the list `a`**
