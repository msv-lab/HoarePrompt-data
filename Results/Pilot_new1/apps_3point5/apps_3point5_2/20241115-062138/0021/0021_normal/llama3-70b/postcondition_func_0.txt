The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, and the minimum distance between these positions. Finally, it prints the maximum of these two distances or `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it operates under the assumption that `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`.
