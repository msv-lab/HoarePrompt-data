Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` are provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can calculate `dist2` using the given formula. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`**
