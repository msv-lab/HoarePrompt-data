Example Answer: 
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is given as an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers. The index of the first occurrence of `n` is then assigned to `max_pos`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`**
