Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and then `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is true (which is equivalent to 1 in Python) and `b` is a non-zero value or a boolean true value, the result of `a % b` will be 0. Therefore, after execution, `a` is 0 and `b` is true. 
Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is true**
