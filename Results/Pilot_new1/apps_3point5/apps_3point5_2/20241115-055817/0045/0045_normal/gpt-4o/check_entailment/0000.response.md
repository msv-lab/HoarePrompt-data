Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` that can be achieved with a sequence of `k` positive numbers.
- If the calculated `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the code returns -1, which is in line with the problem description.
- Otherwise, it computes a sequence list based on the division of `n` by `min_sum` and modifies the sequence list by incrementing values in a specific pattern.
- The code then returns the modified sequence list.
- The code seems to accurately follow the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints also align with the code's functionality.
