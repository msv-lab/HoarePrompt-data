According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to one less than the current value, which is `k - 1`. Additionally, since the loop breaks if `remainder` is equal to 0, the value of `remainder` needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, `remainder` is decreased by 1**
