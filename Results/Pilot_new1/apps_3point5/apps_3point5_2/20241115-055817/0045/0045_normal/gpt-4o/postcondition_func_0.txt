The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If the calculated `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it computes a sequence list based on the division of `n` by `min_sum` and modifies the sequence list by incrementing values in a specific pattern. The function then returns the modified sequence list.
