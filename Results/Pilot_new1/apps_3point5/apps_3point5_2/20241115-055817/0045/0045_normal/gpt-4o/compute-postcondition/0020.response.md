Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i` if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0. This if statement checks if `remainder` is equal to 0, and if it is, the program breaks. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.***
