According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `min_sum`, and the `sequence` list do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains the same, and `sequence` list is created based on the formula provided.
State: **No change in `n`, `k` is at least 1, no change in `min_sum`, `sequence` list is created based on the formula provided**
