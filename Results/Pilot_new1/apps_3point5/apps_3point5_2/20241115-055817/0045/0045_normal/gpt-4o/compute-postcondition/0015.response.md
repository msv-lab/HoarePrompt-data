Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i`, if `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. The program will stop execution if `remainder` equals 0. All other variables and lists retain their initial values and modifications specified in the precondition.***
