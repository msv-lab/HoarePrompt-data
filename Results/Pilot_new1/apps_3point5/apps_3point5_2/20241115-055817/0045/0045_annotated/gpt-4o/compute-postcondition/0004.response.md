Example Answer:
`min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `k`, the output state is dependent on the values of `n` and `k` provided.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `n` and `k` provided, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise the program returns -1.**
