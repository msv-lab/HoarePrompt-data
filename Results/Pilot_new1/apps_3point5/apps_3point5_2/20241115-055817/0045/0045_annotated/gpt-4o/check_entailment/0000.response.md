Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code seems to correctly implement the requirements of the problem. The code calculates the minimum sum required for a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n. If this minimum sum is greater than n, the code returns -1 as expected. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the sequence based on the given conditions. The code handles the case where the answer exists and outputs the resulting sequence accordingly. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality and help in understanding the logic behind the calculations. Additionally, the provided examples align with the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
