Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1. `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum - 2`. `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. `i` is `k - 3` and `k` is greater than 0. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the loop.**
