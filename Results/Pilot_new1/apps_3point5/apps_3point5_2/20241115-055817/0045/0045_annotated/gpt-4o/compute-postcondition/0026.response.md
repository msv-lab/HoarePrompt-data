The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: The function calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: The program returns a list 'sequence' containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + x` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where the value at index `i` is incremented by `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10. It calculates `min_sum` and returns -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, otherwise it returns a list 'sequence' based on the provided formula.
