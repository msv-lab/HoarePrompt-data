Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum - x`, where x is the number of iterations the loop has completed; `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + x` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where the value at index `i` is incremented by x; `i` is `k - x` and `k` is greater than 0. If `remainder` reaches 0, the loop breaks. If `k` is 0 or `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the loop does not execute and `d` remains -1, `remainder` remains as `n`, and `sequence` remains unchanged.**
