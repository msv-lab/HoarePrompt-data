Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum - 1`; `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`; `i` is `k - 2` and `k` is greater than 0**
