Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a % b` will always be less than `b`. Therefore, the new values of `a` and `b` are the previous values of `b` and `a % b` respectively. 
Output State: **a and b are positive integers where a is the previous value of b and b is the remainder when the previous value of a is divided by the previous value of b.**
