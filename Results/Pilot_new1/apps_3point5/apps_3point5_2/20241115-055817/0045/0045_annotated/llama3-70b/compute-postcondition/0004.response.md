Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values. After the execution of `a, b = b, a % b`, `a` will now hold the previous value of `b`, and `b` will hold the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`. 
Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`**
