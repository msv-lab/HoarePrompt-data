Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes two integers n and k as input.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1 as output.
3. It then iterates over a range from 1 to k+1 and appends numbers to the sequence list such that the sum of the sequence is equal to n.
4. If the length of the sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1.
5. Finally, it prints the sequence as output.
6. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case as per the problem description.
