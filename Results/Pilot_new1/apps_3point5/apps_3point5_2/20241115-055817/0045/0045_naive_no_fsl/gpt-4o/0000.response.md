Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. It then checks if this minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
2. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, it calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum. It then calculates the remainder and constructs the sequence by iterating over k and distributing the remainder among the elements of the sequence.
3. The program then returns the resulting sequence if it is possible, or -1 if it is not. The output is formatted correctly as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly generates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor when possible.
