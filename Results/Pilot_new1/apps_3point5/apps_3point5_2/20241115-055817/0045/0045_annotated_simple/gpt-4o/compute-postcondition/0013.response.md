According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `remainder`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `remainder` is not 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `min_sum` should not be greater than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`, and `k` is at least 1**
