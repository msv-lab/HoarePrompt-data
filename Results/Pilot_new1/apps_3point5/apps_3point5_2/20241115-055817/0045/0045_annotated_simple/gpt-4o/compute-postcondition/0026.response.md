The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. 

Case_2: If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, the program returns the sequence calculated based on the conditions mentioned. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, and return -1 if the sum exceeds `n`. Otherwise, it returns the calculated sequence.
