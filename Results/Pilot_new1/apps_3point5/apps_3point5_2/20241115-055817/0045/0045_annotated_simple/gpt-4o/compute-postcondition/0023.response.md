According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 2, and `k` is at least 2. If `remainder` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. After executing the if block, if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted within the range from `k - 2` to 0.
State: **If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 2, `k` is at least 2, `i` is within the range from `k - 2` to 0**
