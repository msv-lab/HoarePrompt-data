Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so `a` now holds the previous value of `b` and `b` now holds the result of `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers and `b` is not equal to 0, the output state is: `a` and `b` are positive integers with updated values after the operation.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with updated values after the operation**
