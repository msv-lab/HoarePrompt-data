Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. The function assumes that the input integers `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any value. **
