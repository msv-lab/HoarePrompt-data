Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
