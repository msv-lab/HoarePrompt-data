Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. Since the input is expected to be integers separated by a space, the values of `x` and `y` are set accordingly. The output state is: x and y are integers satisfying the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
