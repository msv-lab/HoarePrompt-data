Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. The program calculates this by finding the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic works for all possible input cases within the given constraints, as it ensures that Memory can always reach the desired equilateral triangle side length y from the starting side length x by modifying a single side length at a time while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle.
