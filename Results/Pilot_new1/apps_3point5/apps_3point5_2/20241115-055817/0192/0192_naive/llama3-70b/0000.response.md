Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. It simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to reduce the side length from x to y. This logic holds true for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
