Correctness: **False**

The provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers and prints the result. However, it does not actually solve the problem as described in the problem description.

For example, if we take the input (6, 3) as mentioned in the problem description, the code will output 3 (|6 - 3| = 3) instead of the expected output of 4. This is because the code does not take into account the fact that the sides of the triangle must remain integers and that the triangle must remain non-degenerate.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
