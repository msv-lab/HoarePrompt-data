Correctness: False

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length x and the ending side length y, which does not match the requirements of the problem description. The program does not consider the fact that Memory can only modify the length of a single side at a time while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate. 

For example, if we take the input (6, 3) as mentioned in the problem description, the correct output should be 4. However, the given program will output the absolute difference between the two side lengths, which is 3 in this case. This shows that the program does not work as expected for all potential cases.
