Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The calculation is done by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and adding the remainder of the division. This logic ensures that the side lengths are modified in a way that results in a non-degenerate triangle with integer side lengths at each step. The program handles all potential cases correctly as described in the problem statement.
