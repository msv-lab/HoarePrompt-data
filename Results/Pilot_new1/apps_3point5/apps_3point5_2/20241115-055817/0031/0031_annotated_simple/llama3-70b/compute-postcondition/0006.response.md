According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Since `i` is 0, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
