According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - 2*i`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days` squared, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - 2*3`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days` squared, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
