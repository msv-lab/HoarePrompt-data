Example Answer:
A is updated to p_shared // g, and B is the result of p_total divided by g. The values of p_shared, p_total, and g are unknown, so the exact values of A and B cannot be determined. The print statement calculates and prints the modulus of A and B with respect to MOD. Therefore, the Output State is: A is updated to p_shared // g, B is the result of p_total divided by g, and the result of A % MOD and B % MOD is printed.
Output State: **A is updated to p_shared // g, B is the result of p_total divided by g, and the result of A % MOD and B % MOD is printed**
