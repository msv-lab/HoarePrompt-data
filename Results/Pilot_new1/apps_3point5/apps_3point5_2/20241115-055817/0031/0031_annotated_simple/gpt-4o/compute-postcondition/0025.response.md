Example Answer:
The value of A is divided by g using the floor division operator. The previous value of A is p_shared, so after execution, A is updated to p_shared // g. The values of B and the return value of func_1 remain unchanged.
Output State: **A is updated to p_shared // g; B is assigned the value of p_total, and the function func_1 may have returned a specific value**
