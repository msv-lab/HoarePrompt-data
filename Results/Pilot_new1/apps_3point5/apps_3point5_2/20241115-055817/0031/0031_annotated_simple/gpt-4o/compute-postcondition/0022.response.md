Example Answer: 
The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` are not mentioned, so their values remain unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared are unknown; A is assigned the value of p_shared.
Output State: **p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared are unknown; A is assigned the value of p_shared**
