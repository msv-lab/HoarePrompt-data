Example Answer: 
The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, otherwise p_no_shared remains 1; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.
