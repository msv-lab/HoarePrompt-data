The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function also defines MOD as 1000003. After executing the function body, if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, where n and k satisfy certain constraints. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
