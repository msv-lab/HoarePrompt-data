Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`, where `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared` and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The function `func_1` is executed with `p_shared` and `p_total` as arguments. The function may return any value based on its implementation. Therefore, the Output State is: A is assigned the value of p_shared; B is assigned the value of p_total, and the function `func_1` may have returned a specific value.
Output State: **A is assigned the value of p_shared; B is assigned the value of p_total, and the function `func_1` may have returned a specific value**
