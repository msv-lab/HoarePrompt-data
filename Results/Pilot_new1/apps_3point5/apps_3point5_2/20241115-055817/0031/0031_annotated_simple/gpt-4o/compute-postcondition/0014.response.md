According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is the new calculated value, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD**
