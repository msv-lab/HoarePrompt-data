Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the numerator and denominator based on the given formulas. After the loop executes, MOD remains 1000003, total_days remains 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, denominator is the new calculated value, i is the final value of the loop variable, k is greater than 0. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and numerator and denominator remain 1.**
