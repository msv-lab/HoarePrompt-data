Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `denominator` with `total_days` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `total_days` is `1` shifted left by `n`, the new value of `denominator` is `(denominator * total_days) % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is the new calculated value, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
