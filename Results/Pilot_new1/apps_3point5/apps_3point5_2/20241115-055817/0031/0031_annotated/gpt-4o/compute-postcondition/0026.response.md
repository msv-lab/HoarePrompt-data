Example Answer: 
The value of `B` is modified by integer division with `g`, but the initial value of `g` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the modified value of `B` after integer division with `g`.
Output State: **numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the modified value after integer division with `g`**
