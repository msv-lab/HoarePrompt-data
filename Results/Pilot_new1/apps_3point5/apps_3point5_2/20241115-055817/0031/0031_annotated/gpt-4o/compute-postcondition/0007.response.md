Example Answer:
`denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of `MOD`, `total_days`, and `numerator` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
