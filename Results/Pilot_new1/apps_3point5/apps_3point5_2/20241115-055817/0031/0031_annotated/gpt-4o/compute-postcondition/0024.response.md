Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `A` and `B`, where `A` is the value of `p_shared` and `B` is the value of `p_total`. The previous values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
