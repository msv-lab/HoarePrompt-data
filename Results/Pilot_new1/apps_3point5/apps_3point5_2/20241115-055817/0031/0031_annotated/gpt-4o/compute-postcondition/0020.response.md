Example Answer:
`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `denominator` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`.
Output State: **numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`**
