Example Answer:
`A` is divided by `g` using floor division and the result is stored back in `A`. The value of `g` is not provided, so the exact value of `A` after division cannot be determined. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
