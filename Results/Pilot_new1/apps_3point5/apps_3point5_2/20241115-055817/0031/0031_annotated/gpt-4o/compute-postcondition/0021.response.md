Example Answer:
`p_shared` is assigned the value `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, where `p_total` and `p_no_shared` are given values and `MOD` is a constant. The calculation is performed based on these values. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula**
