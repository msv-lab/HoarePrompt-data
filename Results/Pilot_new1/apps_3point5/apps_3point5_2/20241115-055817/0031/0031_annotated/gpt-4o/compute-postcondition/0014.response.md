According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated based on the calculation, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 2, k is greater than 0**
