According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator` multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator` multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, `numerator` is further updated to `numerator` multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`**
