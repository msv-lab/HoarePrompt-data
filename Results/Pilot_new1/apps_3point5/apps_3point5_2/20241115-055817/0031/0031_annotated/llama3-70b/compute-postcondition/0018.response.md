The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of `n` divided by 1000003 and the remainder of `k` divided by 1000003. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, calculate their remainders when divided by 1000003, and return these remainders. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, calculates their remainders when divided by 1000003, and returns these remainders.**
