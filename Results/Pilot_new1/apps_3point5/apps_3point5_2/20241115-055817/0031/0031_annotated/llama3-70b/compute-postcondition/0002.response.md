Example Answer:
`denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of `total_days` and `numerator` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is calculated as 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
