Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after calculating gcd, `numerator` is equal to the product of all (`total_days` - i) where i ranges from 0 to k-1, `denominator` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days` raised to the power of k, `total_days` remains equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`. If k is 0 or negative, `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 2 raised to the power of `n`.**
