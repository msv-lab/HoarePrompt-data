Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both integers. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the input values of `n` and `k`, then computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) between them. Finally, it returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3). The functionality does not accurately reflect the actual code, as it calculates the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` rather than the remainder of `n` divided by `k`. The function lacks the explicit calculation of the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, which is not consistent with the provided annotations.**
