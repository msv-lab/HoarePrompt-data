The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1 and returns. Otherwise, the program returns the value of n. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1 and returns. Otherwise, it returns the value of n.
