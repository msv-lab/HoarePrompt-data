Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly calculate the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
- The function func_1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- The function func_2 handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 and 1, as it is guaranteed that at least two people will share the same birthday in that scenario.
- The code then calculates the numerator and denominator based on the given formulas, taking care of the modulo operation at each step.
- Finally, the code prints the reduced form of the probability as required.

Overall, the code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case, and the output hints also agree with the code.
