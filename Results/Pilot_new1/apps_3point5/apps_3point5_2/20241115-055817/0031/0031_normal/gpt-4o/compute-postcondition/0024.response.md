Output State: **`numerator` is updated based on the formula `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is the number of iterations completed, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
