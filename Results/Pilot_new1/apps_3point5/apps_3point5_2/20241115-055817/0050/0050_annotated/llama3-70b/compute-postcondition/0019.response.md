Example Answer: 
The value of `shares` is incremented by the result of `r // s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, and `s[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described, and `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`**
