Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The value of `shares` is 0, and the value of `b[i]` is not given, so the new value of `r` depends on the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `i` is the next iteration value.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `i` is the next iteration value**
