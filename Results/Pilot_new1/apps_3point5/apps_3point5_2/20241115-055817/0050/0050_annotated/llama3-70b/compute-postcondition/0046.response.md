Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, then processes lists `s` and `b` to calculate the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` based on denominations in `s`. It then adjusts the remaining amount `r` based on the values in list `b`. The final value of `r` is printed as output. The function does not have a specific return value and does not accept any parameters.**
