Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited, and all variables remain unchanged.***
