Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. The input is expected to contain integers. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
