The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the product of three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and then returns the result. The integers `n`, `m`, and `r` satisfy the constraints 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000. The functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the product of `n`, `m`, and `r` and return the result.
