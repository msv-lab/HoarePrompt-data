Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers assigned to variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not impacted by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive**
