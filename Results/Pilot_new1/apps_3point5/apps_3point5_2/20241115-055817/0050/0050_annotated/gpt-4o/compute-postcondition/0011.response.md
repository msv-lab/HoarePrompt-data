Example Answer:
The total amount of bourles is printed. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30. The list `b` is created from the input values. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30. `b` is a list of integers created from the input values. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. The total amount of bourles is printed.
