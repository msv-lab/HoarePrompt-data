Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. `b` is a list of integers created from the input values. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. The total amount of bourles is calculated as the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`, which is then printed.***
