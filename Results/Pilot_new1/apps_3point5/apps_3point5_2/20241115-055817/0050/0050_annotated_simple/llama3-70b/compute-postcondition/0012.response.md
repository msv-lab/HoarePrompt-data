Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`, and `i` remains 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is exited. All possible edge cases are handled, ensuring the integrity of the program variables.***
