Postcondition: ***`n` and `m+1` are integers greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer within the specified range, `s` is a list with elements, `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the `i-th` element of `b`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop.***
