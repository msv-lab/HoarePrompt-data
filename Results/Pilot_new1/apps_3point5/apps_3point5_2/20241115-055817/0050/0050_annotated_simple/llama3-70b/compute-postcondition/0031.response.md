Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer within the specified range, `s` is a list with elements, `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated to the new value calculated based on shares and b[i], and shares is set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks.***
