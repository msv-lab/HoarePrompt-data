Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
