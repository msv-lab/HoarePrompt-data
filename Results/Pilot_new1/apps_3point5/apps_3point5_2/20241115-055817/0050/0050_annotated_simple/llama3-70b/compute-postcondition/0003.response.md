Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values**
