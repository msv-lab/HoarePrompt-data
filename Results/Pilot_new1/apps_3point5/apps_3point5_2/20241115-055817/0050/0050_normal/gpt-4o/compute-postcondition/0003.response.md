Example Answer:
`min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value from the list `s`. The values of `s` are obtained by splitting the input string, and the elements are positive integers. Therefore, the minimum value of `s` will be the minimum buy price. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 30 and 1 <= `r` <= 1000. `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000. `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`.**
