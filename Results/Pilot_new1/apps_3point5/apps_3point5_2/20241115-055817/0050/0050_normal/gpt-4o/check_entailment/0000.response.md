Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integer inputs and correctly calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price from the given lists of prices.
- It then correctly determines the total earnings based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
- The code handles the case where the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price by printing the initial investment `r`.
- It also correctly calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining funds after buying those shares, and the total earnings from selling those shares when the maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price.
- The code provides the expected output based on the input conditions and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
