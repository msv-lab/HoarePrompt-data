The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists `s` and `b`, then sorts `s` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. It iterates through the values in `s` and calculates the number of shares based on the value of `r` and elements in `s`. If `r` is less than the smallest value in `s`, the loop does not execute. Then, it iterates through the values in `b` and updates `r` based on the calculated shares. The final value of `r` is printed at the end. The function does not return any value.
