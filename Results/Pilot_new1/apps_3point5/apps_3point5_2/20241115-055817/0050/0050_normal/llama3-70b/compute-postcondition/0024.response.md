Output State: **If r is greater than or equal to the smallest value in s, shares will be updated by adding the integer division of r by the smallest value in s to the previous value of shares. r will then be updated to the remainder of r divided by the smallest value in s. If r is less than the smallest value in s, the loop will not execute and the values of n, m, r, s, b, shares will remain unchanged.**
