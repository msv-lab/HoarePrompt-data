Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are as described above, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
