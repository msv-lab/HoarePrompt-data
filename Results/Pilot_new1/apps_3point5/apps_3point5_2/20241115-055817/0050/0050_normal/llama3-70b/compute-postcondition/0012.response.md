Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], shares is updated by adding the integer division of r by s[i] to the previous value of shares. r is then updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop is exited and the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged.***
