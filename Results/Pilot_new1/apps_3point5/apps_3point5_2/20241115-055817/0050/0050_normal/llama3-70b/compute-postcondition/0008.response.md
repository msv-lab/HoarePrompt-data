Example Answer: 
`shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The previous values of the variables are known, so after execution, `shares` will increase accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is updated based on the calculation**
