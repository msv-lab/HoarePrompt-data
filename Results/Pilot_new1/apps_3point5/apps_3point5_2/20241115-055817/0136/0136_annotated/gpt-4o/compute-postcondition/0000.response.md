Example Answer:
The input is split into a list named `data`. The variables `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, so after splitting the input, `data` will contain two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` and `data[1]` represents the string `b`. 
Output State: **`data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` and `data[1]` represents the string `b`**
