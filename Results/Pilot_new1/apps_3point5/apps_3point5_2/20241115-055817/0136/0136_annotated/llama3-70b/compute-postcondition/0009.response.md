Postcondition: ***`a` is a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'. This covers all possible cases where `a` and `b` are compared as integers.***
