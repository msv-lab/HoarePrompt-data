Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is an empty string, both `a` and `b` are set to '0'. If `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. Otherwise, the program prints '='. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
