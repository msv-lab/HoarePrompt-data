Example Answer:
The input is split and stored in the list `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are now stored as strings in the list `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
