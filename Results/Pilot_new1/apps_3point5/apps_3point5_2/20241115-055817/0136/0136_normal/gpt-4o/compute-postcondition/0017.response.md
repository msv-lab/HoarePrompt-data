Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros represented as strings. If `a` is an empty string, then both `a` and `b` are set to '0'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and if `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`***
