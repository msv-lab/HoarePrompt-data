Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is updated to remove any leading zeros from the string stored in `data[0]`. If `a` had leading zeros, they are removed. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
