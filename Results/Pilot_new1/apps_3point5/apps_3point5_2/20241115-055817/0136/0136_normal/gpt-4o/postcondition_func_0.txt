The function func_1 reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares their values. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, it assigns '0' to the respective variable. The function does not return any value explicitly.
