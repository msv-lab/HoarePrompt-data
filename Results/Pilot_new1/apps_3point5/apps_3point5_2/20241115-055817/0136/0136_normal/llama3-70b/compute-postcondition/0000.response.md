Example Answer:
The input is accepted as a string and leading zeros are removed from the string. Since the initial state specifies that a and b are non-negative integers, the leading zeros are removed to maintain the non-negativity condition. Therefore, the output state is: a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros.
Output State: **a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros**
