Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. If `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, '>' is printed. This covers all possible cases for the comparison between `a` and `b`.***
