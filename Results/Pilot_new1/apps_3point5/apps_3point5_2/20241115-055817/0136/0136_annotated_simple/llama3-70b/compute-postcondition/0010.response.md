Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'. The values of `a` and `b` are not necessarily equal to each other after the execution of the program fragment.***
