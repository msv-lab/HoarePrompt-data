Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the result of removing leading zeros from the second element of the `data` list. Since the initial state is not provided for the `data` list, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros**
