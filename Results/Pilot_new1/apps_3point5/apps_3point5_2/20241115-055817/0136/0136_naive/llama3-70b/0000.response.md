Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings, removes leading zeroes, then compares them lexicographically to determine which number is greater. The program correctly handles cases where a < b, a > b, or a = b as shown in the provided examples. The logic is straightforward and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not covered by the program.
