According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `i + 1`.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration + 1**
