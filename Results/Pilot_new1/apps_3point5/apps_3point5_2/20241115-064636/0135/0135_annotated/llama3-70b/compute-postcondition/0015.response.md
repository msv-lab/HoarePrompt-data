According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the remainder of n divided by 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2, and if the remainder of n divided by 2 is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits, `seen` is updated with the new `remainder`**
