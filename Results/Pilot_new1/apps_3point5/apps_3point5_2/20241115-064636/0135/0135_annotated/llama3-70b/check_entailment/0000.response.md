Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly reads two integers `n` and `k`, iterates from 1 to `k` calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each number, checks if the remainder is already in the `seen` set, and prints 'No' if it is. Otherwise, it adds the remainders to the `seen` set and prints 'Yes'. The code handles all cases where the remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` need to be distinct. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code logic and what it is supposed to do, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no examples provided where the code does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
