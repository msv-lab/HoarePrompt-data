According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration, `remainder` is the result of n % i. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be considered, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i**
