Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No' as the remainders cannot be distinct. Then, it uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and iterates through the range of integers from 1 to k. If at any point a remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
