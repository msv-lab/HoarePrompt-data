Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set. If the `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables or set after the execution of the if statement.***
