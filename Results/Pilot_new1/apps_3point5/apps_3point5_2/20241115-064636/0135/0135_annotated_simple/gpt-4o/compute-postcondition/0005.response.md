Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, but the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
