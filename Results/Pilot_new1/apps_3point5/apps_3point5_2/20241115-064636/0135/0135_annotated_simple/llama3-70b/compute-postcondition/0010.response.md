Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are input integers, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. The set `seen` contains the value of `remainder`. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`**
