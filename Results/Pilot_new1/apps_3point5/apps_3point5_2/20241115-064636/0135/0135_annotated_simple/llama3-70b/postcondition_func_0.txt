The function reads two input integers n and k, calculates the remainder of n divided by each integer from 1 to k, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
