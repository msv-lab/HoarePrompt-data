Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts an input, `split` splits the input by spaces, `int` converts each part to an integer, and `map` applies this conversion to all parts. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `k` can vary. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers**
