Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The initial state does not specify the value of `n` or `i`, so the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
