According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, so the loop will execute. However, to ensure the loop executes successfully, `i` should start at 1 and `k` should be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
