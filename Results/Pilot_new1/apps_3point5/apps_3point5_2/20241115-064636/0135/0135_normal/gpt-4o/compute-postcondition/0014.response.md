Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is an integer between 1 and k, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. If `remainder` is in the list of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
