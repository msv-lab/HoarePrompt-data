According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
