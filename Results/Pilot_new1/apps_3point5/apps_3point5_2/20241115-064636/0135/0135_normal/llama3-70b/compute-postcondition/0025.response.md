Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not have any return value. Potential edge cases include handling negative values for `n` and `k`, and ensuring proper behavior when `k` is 0.**
