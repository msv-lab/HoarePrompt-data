Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The code follows the problem description accurately by ensuring that all remainders are distinct and printing 'Yes' if they are, and 'No' otherwise. The code handles the edge cases of negative values for `n` and `k`, and properly behaves when `k` is 0. The output hints also agree with the code and describe the functionality correctly.
