Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process described in the problem statement. It keeps track of the indices of employees from both fractions in separate queues and then processes the votes accordingly. The program handles the case where an employee denies another employee to vote by adding the denied employee's index to the end of the queue. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining employees in the queues. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all possible cases.
