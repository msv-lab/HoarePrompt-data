Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a string of fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' (Depublicans) and 'R' (Remocrats) in the fractions string. After that, it compares the counts of 'D' and 'R'. If there are more 'D' characters than 'R' characters, it prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. If the counts are equal, it does not handle this case explicitly. The functionality of the function is to determine the winning party based on the fractions of employees participating in the vote represented by 'D' and 'R'.**
