According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the fractions list has at least 3 elements, and the next fraction is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements and the next fraction is the fourth element in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `republicans` and `remocrats` are integers, fractions list is a list of at least 4 elements, next fraction is the fourth element in the list**
