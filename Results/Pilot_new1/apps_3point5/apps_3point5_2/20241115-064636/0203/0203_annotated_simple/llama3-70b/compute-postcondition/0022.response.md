Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `republicans` and `remocrats` are integers. The loop iterates through the fractions list and increments `republicans` if the fraction is 'D' and `remocrats` otherwise. If the fractions list is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `republicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. The number of republicans is less than or equal to the number of remocrats***
