Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters with `d_index + n` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters with `r_index + n` appended to it. In all cases, `r_index` and `d_index` are the indices popped from the front of their respective queues.***
