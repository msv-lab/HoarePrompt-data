Example Answer:
The value of `i` which is 2 is appended to the list `r_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains 2**
