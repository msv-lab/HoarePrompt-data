According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_index` is less than `r_index`, and either `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters with `d_index + n` appended to it, or `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters with `r_index + n` appended to it. In all cases, `r_index` and `d_index` are the indices popped from the front of their respective queues. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_index` and `d_index` need to be updated to the next indices popped from their respective queues.
2. If `d_queue` is empty, then `r_queue` must not be empty and vice versa.
3. The length of the `votes` string should be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` and `r_index` are updated to the next indices popped from their respective queues, either `d_queue` is not empty or `r_queue` is not empty**
