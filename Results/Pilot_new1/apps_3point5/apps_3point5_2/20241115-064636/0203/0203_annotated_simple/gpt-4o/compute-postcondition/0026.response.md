Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains empty. `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains empty. `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`. If d_index < r_index, `d_queue` is updated with the addition of (d_index + n). If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, `r_queue` is updated with the addition of (r_index + n).***
