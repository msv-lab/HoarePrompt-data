According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters, `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` needs to be updated with the addition of (d_index + n).
2. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` needs to be updated with the addition of (r_index + n).

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters, `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`**
