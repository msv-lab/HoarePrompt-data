Example Answer:
The code pops the first index from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string, after popping the first index, the `d_queue` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains empty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains empty.**
