Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 1 character. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value of `i` appended to it and `r_queue` remains empty. If the first character of `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains the value of `i` appended to it and `d_queue` remains empty. In both cases, `i` is 0 and `v` is the first character of the `votes` string.***
