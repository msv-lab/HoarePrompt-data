Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The previous values of variables are as follows: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters, `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`. After execution, the first element from `d_queue` is removed and assigned to `d_index`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters, `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped index from `d_queue`.**
