The function reads an integer `n` from input and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then processes the votes by creating queues for 'D' and 'R' characters based on their indices. It iterates through the queues, updating the indices based on certain conditions. After processing, it determines the winner based on the majority of votes. If there is a tie, it prints "Tie".
