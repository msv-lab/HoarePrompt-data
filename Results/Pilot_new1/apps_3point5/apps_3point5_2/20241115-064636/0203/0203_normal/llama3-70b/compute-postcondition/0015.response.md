`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 3 elements, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 3 elements, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
