Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input of the number of employees and their corresponding fractions.
- It then processes the votes to determine the majority party ('D' for Democrats or 'R' for Republicans) based on the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string.
- The function iterates through the votes, updating queues for 'D' and 'R' indices, and simulates a voting process by moving indices based on the value of n.
- Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, indicating a majority of Democrat votes; otherwise, it prints 'R' for Republican majority.

The code seems to correctly implement the described voting process and provides the expected outcome based on the order of employees' votes. The logic of moving indices in the queues based on the order of votes ensures that the correct faction wins at the end of the voting process.
