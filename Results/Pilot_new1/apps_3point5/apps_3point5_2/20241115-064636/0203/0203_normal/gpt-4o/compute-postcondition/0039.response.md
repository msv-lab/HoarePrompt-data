According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to contain elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices. `d_index` has been incremented by `n` and added to their respective queues based on the conditions. After the execution of the if-else block, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the updated value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, the updated value of `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.**
