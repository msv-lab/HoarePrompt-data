Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is not affected. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` may have an additional element `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` may have an additional element `r_index + n`.**
