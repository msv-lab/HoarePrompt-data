Output State: If `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute for each character in the `votes` list. After the loop executes, `d_queue` will contain the indices of characters with 'D', and `r_queue` will contain the indices of characters with 'R'. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` list, `d_queue` will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` list, `r_queue` will be empty. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`.
