Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. The loop has executed for each character in the `votes` list. After the loop, `d_queue` contains the indices of characters with 'D', `r_queue` contains the indices of characters with 'R'. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` list, `d_queue` is empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` list, `r_queue` is empty. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with the value `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have an additional element which is `r_index + n`.***
