According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the states such that n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty, depublicans is initialized to 0, remocrats is assigned 0, and fraction is the first element in the fractions list.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty, depublicans is initialized to 0, remocrats is assigned 0, fraction is the first element in the fractions list**
