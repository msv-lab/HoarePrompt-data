Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and categorize the employees based on their political affiliation into `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If all employees have the same political affiliation, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will contain all the indices. If `n` is 0, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`.**
