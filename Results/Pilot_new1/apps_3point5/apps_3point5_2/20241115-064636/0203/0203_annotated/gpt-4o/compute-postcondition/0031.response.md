Output State: If `n` is greater than 0, the loop has executed and categorized the employees based on their political affiliation into `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If all employees have the same political affiliation, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` contains all the indices. If `n` is 0, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. After entering the if condition, if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with the value `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. Additionally, `r_queue` appends the value `r_index + n`.
