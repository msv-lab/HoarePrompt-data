Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, the operation is successful. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is now potentially empty, `r_queue` is not affected, and `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` is not affected, `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`**
