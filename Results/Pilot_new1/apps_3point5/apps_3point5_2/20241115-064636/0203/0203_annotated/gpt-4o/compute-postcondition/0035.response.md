Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. The previous values of `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the popped value from `r_queue`**
