Example Answer:
`d_index` and `n` are added together and appended to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` potentially has one more element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` holds the previous value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the previous popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` potentially has one more element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` holds the previous value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the previous popped value from `r_queue`**
