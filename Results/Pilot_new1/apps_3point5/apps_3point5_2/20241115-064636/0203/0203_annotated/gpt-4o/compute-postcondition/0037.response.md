Example Answer: 
The value `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_index` and `n` are unknown, so the new value appended to `r_queue` is `r_index + n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one more element, `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one more element, `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the popped value from `r_queue`**
