Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. The initial conditions are retained: `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are both greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`. All possible edge cases are covered in the postcondition.***
