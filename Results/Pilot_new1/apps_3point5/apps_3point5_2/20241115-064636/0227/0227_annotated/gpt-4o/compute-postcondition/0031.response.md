Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `m+2` elements of list `a`, where `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `m+2` is greater than 0, `i` is a valid index in `assigned`.***
