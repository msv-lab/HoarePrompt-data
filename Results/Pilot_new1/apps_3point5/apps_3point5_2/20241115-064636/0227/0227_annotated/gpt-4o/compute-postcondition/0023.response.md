Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `m+1` elements of list `a`, where `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`. `m` is increased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `i` is the index of the current element in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, it means there does not exist an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`.***
