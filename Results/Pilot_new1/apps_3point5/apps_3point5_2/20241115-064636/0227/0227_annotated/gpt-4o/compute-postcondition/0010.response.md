Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, indicating that `x` can be formed by subtracting `x` from `a[i]`. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
