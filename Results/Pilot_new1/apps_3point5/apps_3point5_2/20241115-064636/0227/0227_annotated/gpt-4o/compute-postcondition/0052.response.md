Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. The initial conditions remain the same with `n` being greater than 2, `assigned` containing the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` being the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` being greater than 0, and there being no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`.***
