According to the code, the loop can execute if the assigned list has at least one element. Since `assigned` contains the first `m+2` elements of list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`, and `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute if `m+2` is greater than 0. Additionally, the loop will execute if `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `m+2` elements of list `a`, where `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `can_form` is False, `m+2` is greater than 0, `i` is a valid index in `assigned`**
