Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `m` elements of list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is the index of the current element in `assigned`, `can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` exists, `can_form` remains False.** 

If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `can_form` will remain False.
