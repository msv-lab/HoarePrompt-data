Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and a is a list of n distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts the list a in ascending order, then iterates through the list to check if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the previously assigned elements. If a match is found, it continues to the next element; otherwise, it increments the counter m. The function returns the final value of m after processing all elements in the list.**
