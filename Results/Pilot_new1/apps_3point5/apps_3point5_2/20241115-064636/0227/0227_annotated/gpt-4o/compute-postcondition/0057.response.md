According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean variable, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are both greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `assigned` should be considered, so `i` needs to be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are both greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`.**
