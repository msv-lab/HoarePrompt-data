Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the next 2 elements from list `a`, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
