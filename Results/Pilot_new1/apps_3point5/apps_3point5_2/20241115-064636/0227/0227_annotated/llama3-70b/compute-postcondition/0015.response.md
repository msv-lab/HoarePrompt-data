Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is increased by 1 for each pair of adjacent elements in `a` that are not in a ratio of 1:2. The loop will not execute if `n` is 1, and in that case, `m` remains 1. If all adjacent elements in `a` are in a ratio of 1:2, then `m` will be equal to `n`.**
