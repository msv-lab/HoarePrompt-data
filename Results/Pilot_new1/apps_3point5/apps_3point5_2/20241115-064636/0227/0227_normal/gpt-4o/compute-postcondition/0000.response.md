Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order after executing `a.sort()`. The elements in list `a` are already distinct positive integers, so sorting simply rearranges them. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order**
