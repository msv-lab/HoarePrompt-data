According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. The loop iterates over elements in `assigned`. Before the loop starts, the conditions that need to be adjusted are:
1. `can_form` is False if the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is not present in `assigned`.
2. `m` is increased by 1.
3. The new element `a[i]` is added to `assigned`.

State: **If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is not present in `assigned`, `can_form` is False. `m` is increased by 1. `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`.**
