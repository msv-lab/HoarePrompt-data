Output State: **If the difference between any element `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, then `m` is incremented by 1 and the loop terminates. If no such difference exists, `m` is incremented by 1, and the new element `a[i]` is added to `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
