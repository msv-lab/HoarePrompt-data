Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, a list of n distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements to check if the difference between any element and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`. If not, it increments the counter `m`. The function then returns the final value of `m` after the loop terminates. **
