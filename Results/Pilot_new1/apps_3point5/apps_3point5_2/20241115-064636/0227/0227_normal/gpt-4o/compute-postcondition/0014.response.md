Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the second element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` and `x` in list `a` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
