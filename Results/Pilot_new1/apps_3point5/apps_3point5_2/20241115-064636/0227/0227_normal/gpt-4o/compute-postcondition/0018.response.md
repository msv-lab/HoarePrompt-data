Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the third element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without changing any variables.***
