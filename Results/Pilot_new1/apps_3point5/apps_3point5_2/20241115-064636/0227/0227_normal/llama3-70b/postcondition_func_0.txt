The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element. The function increments `m` by 1 for each such element. If `n` is less than 2, `m` remains 1. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.
