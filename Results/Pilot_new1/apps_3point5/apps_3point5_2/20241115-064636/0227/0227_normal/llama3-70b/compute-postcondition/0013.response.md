Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1. In all other cases, `m` remains unchanged. `i` is increased by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.***
