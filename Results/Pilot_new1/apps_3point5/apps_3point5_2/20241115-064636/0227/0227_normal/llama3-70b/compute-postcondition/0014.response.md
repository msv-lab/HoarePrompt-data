According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` may or may not have been increased based on the condition mentioned, and `i` has been increased by 1. 

To prepare for the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `n` remains a positive integer.
2. `a` should still be a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
3. If the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2` was met in the previous iteration, then `m` should be increased by 1. If not, `m` remains unchanged.
4. `i` should be increased by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` may or may not have been increased based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1**
