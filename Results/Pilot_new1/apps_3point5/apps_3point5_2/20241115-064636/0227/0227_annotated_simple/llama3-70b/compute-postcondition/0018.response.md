Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of elements that do not follow the condition of being twice the previous element. The final count `m` is printed if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, -1 is printed. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
