Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input list of distinct positive integers in ascending order and then iterates through the list to check if each element is twice the previous element. If an element does not follow this condition, it increments the count of variables required. The final count is then printed, unless it exceeds the maximum allowed value of 23, in which case -1 is printed. The program handles all potential cases and correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed.
