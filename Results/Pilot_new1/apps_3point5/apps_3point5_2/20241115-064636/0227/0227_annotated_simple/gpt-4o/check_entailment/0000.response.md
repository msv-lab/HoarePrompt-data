Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It iterates through the given sequence of integers and checks if each number can be formed as the sum of two previously assigned numbers. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The program then returns the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases, making the program correct.
