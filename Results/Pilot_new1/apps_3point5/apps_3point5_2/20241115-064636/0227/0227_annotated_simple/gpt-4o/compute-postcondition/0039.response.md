Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`. `x` iterates over the next element in `assigned`. `m` is further incremented by 1. `i` is updated to the next index in `a`. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
