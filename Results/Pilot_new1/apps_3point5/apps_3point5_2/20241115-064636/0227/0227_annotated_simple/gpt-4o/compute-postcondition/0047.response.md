Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `i+1`, `n`, `a`, `assigned ∪ {a[i]}`, `x` remain unchanged, and `can_form` is False.
Output State: **`m`, `i+1`, `n`, `a`, `assigned ∪ {a[i]}`, `x` remain unchanged, and `can_form` is False**
