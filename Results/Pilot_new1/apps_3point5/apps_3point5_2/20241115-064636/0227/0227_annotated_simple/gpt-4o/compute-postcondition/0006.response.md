According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `assigned` is not empty. Since `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, it means `a` is not empty. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `assigned` should not be empty, `x` should be the first element of `a`, and `m` should be 1.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `can_form` is False**
