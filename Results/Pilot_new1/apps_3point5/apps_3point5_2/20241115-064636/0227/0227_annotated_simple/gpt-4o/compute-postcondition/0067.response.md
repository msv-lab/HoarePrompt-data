According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` is updated with the value of `a[i]`, `can_form` may be updated based on the conditions, and `m` may be incremented by 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`, so it should be `i < n`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`assigned` is updated with the value of `a[i]`, `can_form` may be updated based on the conditions, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`**
