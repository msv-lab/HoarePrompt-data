According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`, `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it becomes 2.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`, `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
