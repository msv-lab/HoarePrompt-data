According to the code, the loop will execute for each element `x` in the assigned set until a condition is met that sets `can_form` to True and breaks the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `m`, `i+1`, `n`, `a`, `assigned ∪ {a[i]}`, `x` are elements in the assigned set and `can_form` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the next `x` element in the assigned set needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next element `x` in the assigned set.
State: **`m`, `i+1`, `n`, `a`, `assigned ∪ {a[i]}`, `next_x` are elements in the assigned set. `can_form` is False.**
