Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. 

One potential case where the program does not work as expected is when the balance is 0 and the desired balance $x$ is in the list of prefix balances. In this case, the program should output $-1$ as there are an infinite number of such prefixes, but the program incorrectly outputs $0$.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 0
1010
```
The program should output $-1$ as there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance 0, but it incorrectly outputs $0`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
