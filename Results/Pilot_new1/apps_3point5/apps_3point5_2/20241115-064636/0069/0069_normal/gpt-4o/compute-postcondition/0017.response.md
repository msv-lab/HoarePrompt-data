Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`**
