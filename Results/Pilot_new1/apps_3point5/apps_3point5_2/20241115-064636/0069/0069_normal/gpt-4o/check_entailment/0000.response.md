Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One potential case where the code fails to provide the correct output is when the balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` is 0 but the desired balance `x` is not in the prefix balances. In this case, the code should output -1 as there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance, but the code incorrectly outputs 0.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
