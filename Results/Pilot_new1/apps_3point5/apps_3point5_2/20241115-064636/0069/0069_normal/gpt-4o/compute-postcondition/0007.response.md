Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, which extracts an integer value from `data` at index `index + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer extracted from `data` at index `index`, and `T` is greater than 0. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`**
