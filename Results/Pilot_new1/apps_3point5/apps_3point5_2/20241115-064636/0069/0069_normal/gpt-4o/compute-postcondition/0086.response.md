According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is assigned the value at index + 2 of the data list, `prefix_balances` is a list containing the updated prefix sums, `n` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed + 1, `x` is updated to the integer value at index + 1 of the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `count` is an integer based on the specified conditions, `results` list contains the updated values of `count`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, `i` is 1.
