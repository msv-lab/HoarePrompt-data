According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`, which represents the number of test cases. T needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since the index is assigned the value 1, it indicates that the loop should start with the first test case. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
