Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `n` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is updated based on the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `count` is an integer. If the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied, `count` is incremented by 1.***
