Example Answer:
The list `results` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `T` and `index` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: T is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which represents the number of test cases to be run. Index is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **T is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which represents the number of test cases to be run. Index is assigned the value 1.**
