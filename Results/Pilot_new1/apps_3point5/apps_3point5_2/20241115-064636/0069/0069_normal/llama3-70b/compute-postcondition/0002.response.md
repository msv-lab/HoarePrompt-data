Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping integers from the input split by space. The input is taken from the user, and the values are converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers.
Output State: **T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers**
