Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated. `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed.***
