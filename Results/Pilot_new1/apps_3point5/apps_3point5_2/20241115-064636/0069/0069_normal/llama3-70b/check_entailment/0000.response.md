Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the balance of the string 's' correctly.
- It handles the cases where the balance equals 'x' and prints 'n + 1'.
- It correctly identifies the cases where there are infinite prefixes and prints -1.
- It also correctly calculates and prints the number of prefixes in other cases.
- The output hints agree with the code and the code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
