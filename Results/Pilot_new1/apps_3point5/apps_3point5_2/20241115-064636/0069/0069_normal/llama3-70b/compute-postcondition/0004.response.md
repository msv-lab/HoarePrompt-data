Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s` respectively. The initial state does not provide the value of `s`, so the output state will be: T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.
Output State: **T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
