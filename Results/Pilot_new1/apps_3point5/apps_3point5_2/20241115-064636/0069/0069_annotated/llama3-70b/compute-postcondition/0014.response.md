Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed.***
