Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The values of `T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same. The values of `n` and `x` are assigned new integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, and `s` is assigned the input string.
Output State: **`T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the input string**
