Postcondition: ***`T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` holds the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` holds the count of '1' characters in `s`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all possible scenarios including edge cases where the denominator could be zero, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions stated.***
