Example Answer:
The balance is calculated by subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the input string `s`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are determined by counting the respective characters in the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T-1` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`.
Output State: **`T-1` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`**
