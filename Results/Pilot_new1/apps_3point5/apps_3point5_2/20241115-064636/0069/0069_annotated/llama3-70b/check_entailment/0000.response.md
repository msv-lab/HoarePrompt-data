Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. The code reads the input, calculates the balance of the string, and then determines the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The code also accounts for cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes by checking if the denominator could be zero. The annotations provide a clear summary of what each part of the code does and how it handles different scenarios. Since the code aligns with the problem description and there are no examples provided where the code would fail to produce the correct output, we can conclude that the code is correct.
