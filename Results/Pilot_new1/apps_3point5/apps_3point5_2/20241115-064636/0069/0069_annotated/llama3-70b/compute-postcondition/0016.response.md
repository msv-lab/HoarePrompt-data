Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `T-1` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1.
Output State: **`T-1` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1**
