Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n` and `x` are unknown, so after execution, `n` and `x` will have new integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `n + 1`, `x`, `s` remain the same, `n` and `x` are assigned new integer values.
Output State: **`T`, `n + 1`, `x`, `s` remain the same, `n` and `x` are assigned new integer values**
