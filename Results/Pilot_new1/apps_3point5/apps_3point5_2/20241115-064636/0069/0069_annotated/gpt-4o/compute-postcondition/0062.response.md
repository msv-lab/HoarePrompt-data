Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is a specific value, `s` is set to a specific value, `index` is adjusted, `balance` is updated to 0, `prefix_balances` is updated. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` set, the `results` list appends -1; otherwise, if `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` set, the `results` list appends 0.***
