Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's and '-1's in the binary string `s` up to each index and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. The `balance` is not equal to 0.***
