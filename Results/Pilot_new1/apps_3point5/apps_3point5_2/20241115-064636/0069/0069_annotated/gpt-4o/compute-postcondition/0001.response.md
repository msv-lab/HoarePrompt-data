Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function splits the input data into a list. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. After splitting the input, the values are stored in the `data` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer within the range [-10^9, 10^9], `s` is a binary string of length `n`, and `data` contains the split input values.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer within the range [-10^9, 10^9], `s` is a binary string of length `n`, and `data` contains the split input values**
