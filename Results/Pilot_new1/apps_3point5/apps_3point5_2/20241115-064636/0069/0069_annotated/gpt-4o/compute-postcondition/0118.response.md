According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `prefix_balances` list must have at least 1 element and `results` list must have at least 1 element. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as `result` is in `results`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are: `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in `results`.
State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results**.
