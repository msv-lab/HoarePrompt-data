According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is a positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop will execute one more time with the same states as the end of the previous iteration.**
