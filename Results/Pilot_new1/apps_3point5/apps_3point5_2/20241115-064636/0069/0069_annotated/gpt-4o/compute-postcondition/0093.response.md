Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.**
