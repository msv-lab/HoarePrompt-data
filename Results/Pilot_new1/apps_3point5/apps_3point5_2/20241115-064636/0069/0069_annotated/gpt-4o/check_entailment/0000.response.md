Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One of the issues is that the code does not handle the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The problem description states that if there is an infinite number of such prefixes, the program should output -1. However, the code does not check for this condition and does not output -1 when necessary.

Additionally, the code has a logical error in the condition `if x in prefix_balances:`. This condition checks if the desired balance `x` is in the list of prefix balances, which is incorrect. The condition should check if the desired balance `x` can be achieved by any prefix balance, not if it is exactly equal to one of the prefix balances.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the code, the correctness of the program is **False**.
