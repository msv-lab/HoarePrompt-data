According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` needs to start at 1.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
