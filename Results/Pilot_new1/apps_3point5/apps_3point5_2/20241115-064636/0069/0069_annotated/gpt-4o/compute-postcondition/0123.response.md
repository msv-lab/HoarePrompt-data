Example Answer:
The value of `result` is printed, but the previous values of the variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the value of `result` is printed again.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the value of `result` is printed again**
