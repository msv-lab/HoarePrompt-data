Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible scenarios including the edge cases where balance is equal to x or the modulo operation results in 0.***
