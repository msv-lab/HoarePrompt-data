Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned new integer values from input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `x` are updated based on the input, so the output state is: `T` is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the new input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated based on the new `s`, `balance` is recalculated based on the new `cnt0` and `cnt1`.
Output State: **`T` is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the new input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated based on the new `s`, `balance` is recalculated based on the new `cnt0` and `cnt1`**
