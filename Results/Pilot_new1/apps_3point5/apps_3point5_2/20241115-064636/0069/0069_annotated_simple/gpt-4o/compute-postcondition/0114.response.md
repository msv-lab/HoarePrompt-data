Output State: **If balance is 0, the loop will not execute, `prefix_balances` will remain a list of length 1 filled with zeros, `balance` is 0, and `count` is 0. If balance is not 0, the loop will iterate through `prefix_balances`, incrementing `count` by 1 for each element `b` that satisfies the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `balance` is 0, and `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet the conditions. `results` will have the count appended to it.**
