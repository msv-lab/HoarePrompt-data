Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of the differences between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of length 1 filled with zeros.**
