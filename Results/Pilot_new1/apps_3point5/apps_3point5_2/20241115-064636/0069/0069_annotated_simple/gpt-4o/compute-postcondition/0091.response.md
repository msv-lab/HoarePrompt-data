Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and the count of '1's in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated to the value of `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[3]` is updated to the value of `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)**
