Example Answer:
`index` is incremented by 3. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`**
