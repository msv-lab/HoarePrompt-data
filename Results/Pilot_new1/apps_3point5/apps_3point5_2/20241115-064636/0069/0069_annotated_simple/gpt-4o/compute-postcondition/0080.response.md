Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the index to access an element in the list. The loop will execute one more time with the adjusted state based on the conditions mentioned at the end of the previous iteration.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states**
