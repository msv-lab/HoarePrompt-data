Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances in the string `s` and stores them in `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of 0s. If `balance` is 0, then the loop will exit and the values in `prefix_balances` will remain unchanged. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to `results`.***
