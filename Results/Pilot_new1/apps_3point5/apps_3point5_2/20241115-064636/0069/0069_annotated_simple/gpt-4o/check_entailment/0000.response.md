Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the string based on the given formula.
3. It then calculates the prefix balances for each prefix of the string.
4. It correctly handles the cases where the balance is 0 and determines if there are infinite prefixes or not.
5. It correctly counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance for cases where the balance is not 0.
6. The program outputs the results for each test case as expected.
