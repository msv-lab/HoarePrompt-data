According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 non-zero elements, `balance` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the `prefix_balances` list must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 non-zero elements, `balance` is not equal to 0**
