Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. The program correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward and Natasha, then determines the minimum time needed to move between blocks and floors. The logic for handling different scenarios such as moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the building, using the elevator, and moving between floors is implemented correctly. 

Additionally, the program uses the absolute difference between block numbers to handle cases where Edward and Natasha are in different blocks, and considers the circular nature of the building by taking the minimum distance between blocks. Overall, the program covers all the possible scenarios described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
