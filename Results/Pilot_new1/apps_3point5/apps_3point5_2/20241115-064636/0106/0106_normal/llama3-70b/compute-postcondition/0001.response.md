Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split operation using `map(int, input().split())`. The values are converted to integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned integer values from the input split operation, `n`, `m`, `k` have unknown values.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integer values from the input split operation, `n`, `m`, `k` have unknown values**
