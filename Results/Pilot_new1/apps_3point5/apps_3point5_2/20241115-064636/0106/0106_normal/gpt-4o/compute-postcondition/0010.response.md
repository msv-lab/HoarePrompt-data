Output State: **`block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the block and floor numbers calculated based on the value of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the block and floor numbers returned by the function `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5**
