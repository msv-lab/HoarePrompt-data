Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, `a` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, `b` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, `a_floor` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m, `a_block` is an integer calculated based on the formula provided, `b_floor` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ b_floor ≤ m, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. In addition, `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
