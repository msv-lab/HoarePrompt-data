Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates various floor and block positions based on the input values, and then computes and prints the total time taken to move between the two positions. The time calculation involves determining the minimum time to move between blocks and floors based on the given conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
