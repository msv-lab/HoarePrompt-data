Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are set to the locations of `a` and `b`, `time_to_exit` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, `direct_walk_time` is calculated, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated, `min_walk_time` is set to the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
