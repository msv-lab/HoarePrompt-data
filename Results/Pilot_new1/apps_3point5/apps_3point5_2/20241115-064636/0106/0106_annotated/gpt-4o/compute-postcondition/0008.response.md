Example Answer: 
`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. The previous values of `block_a` and `block_b` are known, and `n` is a constant value. Therefore, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on these values. 
Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are set to the locations of `a` and `b`, `time_to_exit` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, `direct_walk_time` is calculated, and `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
