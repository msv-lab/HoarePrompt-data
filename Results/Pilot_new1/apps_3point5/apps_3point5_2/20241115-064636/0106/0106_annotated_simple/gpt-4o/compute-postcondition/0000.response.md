The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is used to calculate the value of `block`. The variables `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are required to determine the value of `block`. 
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
