Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `apartment`, calculates the block and floor numbers based on the values of `m` and `k`, and returns these calculated values. It correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for the given apartment number. However, it does not handle edge cases where `m` or `k` could be zero, which might lead to division by zero errors.**
