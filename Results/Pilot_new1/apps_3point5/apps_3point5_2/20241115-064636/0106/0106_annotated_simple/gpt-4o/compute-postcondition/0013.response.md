The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the total time calculated as the sum of time to exit, minimum walk time, and time to target floor. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` meeting the specified constraints, and calculate and return the total time based on the given parameters.
