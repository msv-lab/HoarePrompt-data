Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `a` is the input integer, `m` and `k` are input integers as well. The value of `a_block` is determined by the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula, and `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula, and `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided**
