The function prompts the user to input three positive integers a, b, and c. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the given constraints. The total number of fruits is calculated by summing the products of the maximum lemons with their respective values (1, 2, and 4). Finally, the total number of fruits is printed as output. The function does not handle any errors or edge cases related to invalid inputs or division by zero.
