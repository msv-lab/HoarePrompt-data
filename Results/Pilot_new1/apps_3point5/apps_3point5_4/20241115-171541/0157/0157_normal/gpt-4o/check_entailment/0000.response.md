Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the given constraints of the ratio of fruits required for the compote. It then calculates the total number of fruits by summing the products of the maximum lemons with their respective values (1, 2, and 4). The output matches the expected output as per the problem description and examples provided. The code handles all possible scenarios and provides the correct output.
