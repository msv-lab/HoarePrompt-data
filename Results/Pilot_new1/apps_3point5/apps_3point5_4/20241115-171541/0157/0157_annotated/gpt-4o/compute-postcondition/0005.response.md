Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `total_fruits`. The value of `total_fruits` is not explicitly given in the initial state. However, based on the information provided, `total_fruits` can be calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` and `c`. `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4, `total_fruits` is the calculated total number of fruits.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4, `total_fruits` is the calculated total number of fruits**
