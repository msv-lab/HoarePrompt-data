Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4, assigns it to `min_lemon`, and prints the result of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
