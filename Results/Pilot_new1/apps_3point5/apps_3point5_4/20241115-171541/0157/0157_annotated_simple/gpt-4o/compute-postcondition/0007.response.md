Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be bought based on the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. After that, it computes the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. The total number of fruits is then printed as output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
