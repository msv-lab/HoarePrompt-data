Example Answer:
The value of `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum value among (a/2), (b/2), and (c/4). Then, the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is evaluated. After performing the calculations, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4**
