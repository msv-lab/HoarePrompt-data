Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then the program prints 'YES'. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is false, then the program prints 'NO'. This covers all possible scenarios based on the conditions provided.***
