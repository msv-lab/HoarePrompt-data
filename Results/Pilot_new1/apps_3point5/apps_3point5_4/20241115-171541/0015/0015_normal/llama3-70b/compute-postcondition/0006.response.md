Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `c` is equal to 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES'. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the program prints 'NO'. The program handles all cases where `a` and `b` are integers, and `c` is 0, providing the appropriate output based on the equality of `a` and `b`.***
