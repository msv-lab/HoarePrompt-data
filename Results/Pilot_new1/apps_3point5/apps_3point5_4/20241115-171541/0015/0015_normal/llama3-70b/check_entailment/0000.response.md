Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. 
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', which covers the case when `b` appears in the sequence.
- If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise, which covers the case when the favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is not 0 and the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c` or the result is negative, it prints 'NO', which covers the case when all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite number. 

Therefore, the code meets all the requirements of the problem description and the output hints agree with the code's logic.
