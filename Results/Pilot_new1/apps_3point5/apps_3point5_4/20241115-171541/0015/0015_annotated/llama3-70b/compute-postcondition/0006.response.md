Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. `c` is equal to 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible cases where the program will print either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the equality of `a` and `b`.***
