Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks if Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence based on the conditions provided. The code handles the cases where b is equal to a, where c is equal to 0, and where the difference between b and a is divisible by c and non-negative. The code annotations also accurately describe the conditions and the expected output based on those conditions. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
