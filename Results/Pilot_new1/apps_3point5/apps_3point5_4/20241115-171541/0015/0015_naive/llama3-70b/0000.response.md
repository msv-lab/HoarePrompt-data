Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is equal to 0, then the sequence will consist of the same number (a) repeated infinitely. So, if a is equal to b, then b will appear in the sequence. This case is handled correctly in the program.
2. If c is not equal to 0, then the sequence will be in the form a, a + c, a + 2c, ... and so on. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then b will appear in the sequence. This case is also handled correctly in the program.
