Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. It checks for two main cases:
1. When the difference between neighboring elements (c) is 0, it directly compares if the first element (a) is equal to Vasya's favorite number (b). If they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. When the difference between neighboring elements (c) is not 0, it calculates if Vasya's favorite number (b) can be reached from the first element (a) by adding multiples of the difference (c). If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and handles both edge cases and general cases effectively. Thus, the program is correct.
