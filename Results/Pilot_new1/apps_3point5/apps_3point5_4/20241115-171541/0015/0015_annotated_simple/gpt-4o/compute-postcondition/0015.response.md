Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integer values a, b, and c from the user input. It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is equal to 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it evaluates the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0). If this condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates based on user input.**
