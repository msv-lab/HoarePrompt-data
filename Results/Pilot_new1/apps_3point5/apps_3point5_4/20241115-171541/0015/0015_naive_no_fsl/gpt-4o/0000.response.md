Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the conditions described in the problem. The program handles the case where b is equal to a, the case where c is equal to 0, and the general case where the difference between b and a is a multiple of c and the result is non-negative. The logic in the program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, hence the correctness of the program.
