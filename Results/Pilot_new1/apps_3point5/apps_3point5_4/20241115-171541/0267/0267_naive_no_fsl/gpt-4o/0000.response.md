Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits.
2. The program uses the `func_1` function to check if a number satisfies the condition of having at most $k$ different digits.
3. The program then iterates through all numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition to the total sum.
4. The program calculates the total sum modulo $998244353$ as required.
5. The program correctly handles all potential cases and examples provided in the problem description.
