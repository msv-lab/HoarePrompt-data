Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the count of such numbers within a given range. The implementation of the `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range.

The main function reads the input values, calls `func_1` with the input values, and prints the result modulo $998244353$. The logic used in the program is consistent with the problem description, and the provided examples demonstrate that the program produces the correct output for those cases. Therefore, based on the implementation and the provided examples, the code is correct.
