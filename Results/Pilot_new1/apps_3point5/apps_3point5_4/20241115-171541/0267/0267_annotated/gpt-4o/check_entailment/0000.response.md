Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks if a number has at most `k` different digits, but the main function `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` without considering the constraint of having at most `k` different digits. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description.
