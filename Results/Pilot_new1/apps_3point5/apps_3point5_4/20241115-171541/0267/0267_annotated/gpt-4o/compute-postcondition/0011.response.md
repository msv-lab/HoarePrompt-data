According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `num` is within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer that gets updated based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `num` needs to be adjusted to the next integer within the range of `l` to `r`.
State: **total_sum is an integer. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true for the next num, total_sum is updated to the result of (total_sum + num) % MOD. Otherwise, total_sum remains unchanged. This ensures that total_sum is correctly modified based on the condition of func_1(num, k) and the value of num, while maintaining its integrity in all other cases. num is the next integer within the range of l to r.**
