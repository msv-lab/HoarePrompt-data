Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`. 

The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It relies on the `count` function to perform the necessary calculations. The formula used in `func_1` to calculate the sum is consistent with the problem description, which is to find the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` and subtract the sum of numbers from `1` to `l-1`. The modulo operation is also correctly applied.

The `count` function handles the counting logic based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. The function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits as described in the problem statement. The logic for updating the dictionary `dp` and the formula used to calculate the count are aligned with the problem description.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case, and the annotations provided also match the logic implemented in the functions. Therefore, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
