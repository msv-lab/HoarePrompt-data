Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[n, k]` with `MOD`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
