Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If the key (n, k) exists in `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. If n < 10 ** k, `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculations described in the else part. In the else part, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
