According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the provided formula**
