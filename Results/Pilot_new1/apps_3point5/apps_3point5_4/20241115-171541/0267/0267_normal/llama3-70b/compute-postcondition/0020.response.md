Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, then the function returns the value stored at that key. If n < 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is updated by adding multiples of 9 and adjusting based on the position of n within the range of powers of 10. Finally, dp[n, k] is taken modulo MOD to ensure the result remains within the desired range.***
