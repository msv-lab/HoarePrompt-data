According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, the updated value of `dp[n, k]`, and i is incremented by 1**
