According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next integer after `l`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: *`total_sum` is an integer, `l` and `r` are valid bounds, `num` is equal to `l + 1*
