Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through each number in the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For each number, it calls `func_1(num, k)` and if the result is true, it updates the `total_sum` by adding the number and taking the modulo with `MOD`. The function then returns the final value of `total_sum`. The constraints for the parameters are `1 <= l <= r < 10^18` for `l` and `r`, and `1 <= k <= 10` for `k`. It is important to note that the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided in this code snippet, so the behavior of `func_1` is crucial for the overall functionality of `func_2`.**
