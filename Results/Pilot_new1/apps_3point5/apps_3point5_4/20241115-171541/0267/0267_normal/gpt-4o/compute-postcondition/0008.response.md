According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` and `r` are valid bounds, `num` is equal to `l + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 and `total_sum` needs to be updated based on the condition `func_1(num, k)` evaluating to true.
State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the condition `func_1(num+1, k)` evaluating to true, `l` and `r` are valid bounds, `num` is equal to `l + 2**`.
