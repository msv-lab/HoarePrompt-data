Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to solve the given problem.
- `func_1` checks if the number of unique characters in the string representation of a number `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `func_2` iterates through each number in the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive, and calls `func_1(num, k)` for each number. If the result is `True`, it adds the number to the `total_sum` and takes the modulo with `MOD`.
- The code seems to correctly calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The constraints for the input parameters are also satisfied.
- The output hints do not provide any contradicting information or edge cases that the code might not handle.
- Therefore, based on the code logic, the description of the problem, and the absence of contradicting information in the output hints, the code is correct.
