According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 2` and `l` and `r` are valid bounds. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be updated to `l + 3` as it iterates through the range from `l` to `r + 1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` is equal to `l + 3`, `k` are all integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.**
