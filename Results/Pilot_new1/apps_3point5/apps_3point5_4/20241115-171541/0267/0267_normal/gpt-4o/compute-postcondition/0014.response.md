The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are as follows: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the updated value of 'total_sum' after executing the loop for each 'num' in the range from 'l' to 'r' based on the condition 'func_1(num, k)'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the updated value of 'total_sum' based on the condition 'func_1(num, k)' for each 'num' in the range from 'l' to 'r'.
