According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next value after `num` should be within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the state of the variables.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l` within the range of `l` to `r`, based on the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`**
