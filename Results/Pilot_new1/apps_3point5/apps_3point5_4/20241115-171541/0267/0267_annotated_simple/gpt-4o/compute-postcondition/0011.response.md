According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` are maintained such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` value within the range of `l` to `r` needs to be determined. If `l` is less than `r`, then the next `num` value will be `num + 1`. If `l` is equal to `r`, then the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
- If `l` is less than `r`, then `num` should be updated to `num + 1`.
- If `l` is equal to `r`, then the loop will not execute again.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1`, `k`** if `l` is less than `r`, **OR** **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k`** if `l` is equal to `r`.
