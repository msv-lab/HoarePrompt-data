Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is the next value after `l` within the range of `l` to `r`. The values of `l` and `r` are maintained such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. The relationship between `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k` is preserved after the execution of the if statement.***
