Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The two functions provided in the code are correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.
2. Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and then checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
3. Function 2 (`func_2`) iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and for each number, it checks if it satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits using `func_1`. If the condition is satisfied, it adds the number to the `total_sum` variable and takes the modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.
4. The program handles all potential cases described in the problem statement and correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria of having at most `k` different digits.
