Output State: **total_sum is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num`, and `k` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD` for each `num` in the range from `l` to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables.**
