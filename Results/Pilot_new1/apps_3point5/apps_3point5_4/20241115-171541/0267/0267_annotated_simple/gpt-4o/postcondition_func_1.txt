The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through a range from `l` to `r`, inclusive, and for each number in this range, it calls `func_1` with that number and `k`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, it updates `total_sum` by adding the number and taking the modulo of `MOD`. The function then returns the final value of `total_sum`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains unchanged. The function does not handle cases where `l` or `r` are outside the valid range of 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 or where `k` is outside the range of 1 <= k <= 10.
