According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] = 9. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that k is greater than 1 and i is 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] = 9, i is 1**
