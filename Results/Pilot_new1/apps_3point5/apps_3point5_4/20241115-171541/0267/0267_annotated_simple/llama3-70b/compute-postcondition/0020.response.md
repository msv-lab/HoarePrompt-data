Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is set to 9 initially. Then dp[n, k] is updated by adding 9 multiplied by 10 to the power of (i - 1) multiplied by (10 to the power of (k - i) minus 10 to the power of (i - 1)) for i ranging from 1 to k. Additionally, dp[n, k] is further updated by adding (10 to the power of (k - 1) minus 10 to the power of (k - 2)) multiplied by (n divided by 10 to the power of (k - 1) minus 1). Finally, dp[n, k] is taken modulo MOD.***
