Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$. The function utilizes a helper function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits.

The implementation of the `count` function correctly handles the calculation of the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in the given range. It considers different cases based on the value of $n$ and $k$ to calculate the count efficiently.

The main function `func_1` then uses the `count` function to calculate the sum of numbers in the range $l$ to $r$ and returns the result modulo $998244353$. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases within the given constraints.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True as it satisfies all requirements and provides the expected output.
