Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop iterates through each digit in the list 'digits' and checks if the digit is present in any of the cube_faces. If the digit is found in any cube_faces, the corresponding index in 'used_cubes' is set to True, and 'found' is set to True. If the digit is not found in any cube_faces, 'found' remains False. If 'found' is False after the loop completes, the program will return False. If 'n' is 0, the loop does not execute.**
