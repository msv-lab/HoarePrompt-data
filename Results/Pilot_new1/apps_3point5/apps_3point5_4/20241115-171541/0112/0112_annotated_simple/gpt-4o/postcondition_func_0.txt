The function func_1 accepts an integer n representing the number of cubes Masha has and a list of cubes. It iterates through the cubes and creates a set of faces for each cube. It then calculates the value of x based on the value of n: If n is 1, x is 1. If n is 2, x is 2. If n is 3, x is 4. If n is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute, and x remains 0.
