Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number with at least 1 digit, digit is the first digit in the list, used_cubes is a list of n Boolean values with the 1st and ith elements set to True if not already set to True and the rest remain False, found is True if the digit is found in the faces of the 1st cube, i is 2. If not used_cubes[i] and digit is in cube_faces[i], then used_cubes[i] is set to True, found is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
