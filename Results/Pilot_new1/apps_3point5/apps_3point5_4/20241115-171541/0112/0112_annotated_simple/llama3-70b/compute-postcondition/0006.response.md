Example Answer: 
The code iterates through each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list and adds its string representation to the digits set. As the cubes list has at least 2 sublists, the first sublist is considered. If the first sublist contains digits like [1, 2, 3], then after the code execution, the digits set will be updated with the strings '1', '2', and '3'. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 2 sublists, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 2 sublists, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list**
