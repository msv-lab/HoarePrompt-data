According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. Since n is between 1 and 3 inclusive, there can be a maximum of 3 sublists in the cubes list based on the input values. Before the loop starts, the digits set is empty. So for the loop to be executed, the cubes list must have at least 1 sublist, and the cube is the first sublist in the cubes list.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists with at least 1 sublist, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first sublist in the cubes list**
