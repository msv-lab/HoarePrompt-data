Functionality: **The function reads input for n number of cubes, where each cube contains 6 integers representing the digits on each face. It then extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts them in descending order, concatenates them into a single number, and prints the maximum possible number that can be formed from the extracted digits.**
