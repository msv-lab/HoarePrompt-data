Example Answer:
The code initializes a list `cubes` containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is created by mapping the input values to integers after splitting the input. Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, the number of sublists and the values within them will vary based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists based on the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists based on the input values**
