According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 sublists, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 3 sublists. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 4 sublists.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 4 sublists, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list**
