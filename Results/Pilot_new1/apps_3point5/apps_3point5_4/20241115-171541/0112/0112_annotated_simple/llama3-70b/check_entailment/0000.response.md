Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement.
2. It extracts all the unique digits from the cubes and removes '0' if present.
3. It then sorts the digits in descending order and constructs the maximum number that can be formed from those digits.
4. The program outputs the correct maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes.
5. The program follows the rules of not being able to make 6 from 9 and vice versa, which is in line with the problem description.
6. The logic of the program ensures that the maximum number that can be formed is outputted correctly based on the available cubes and their digits.
