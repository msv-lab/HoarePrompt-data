Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The program correctly checks if Masha can form a number from 1 to x using the given cubes.
3. The program iterates to find the maximum number x that Masha can make and returns it.
4. The logic of checking if Masha can form a number is implemented correctly by checking if each digit of the number can be formed using the faces of the cubes.
5. The program uses a brute force approach to find the maximum number x that can be formed, which is a valid method for this problem.
6. The program handles the case where Masha can't make even 1 by returning 0.

Overall, the program seems to correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
