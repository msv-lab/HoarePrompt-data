The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The precondition for `num` is that it is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer in `cube_faces` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

After executing the function body, if n is at least 1, `used_cubes` will have at least one element set to True, `found` will be True if a cube with the digit is found, otherwise False. If n is 0, no changes occur in the variables. After the execution of the if statement, if `found` is False, the program returns False. If there are duplicate digits in the `cube_faces` lists, the loop may not execute completely, and the program may return False.

In Case 2, the program returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list of cube faces, and determine if a cube with the specified digit is found based on the conditions mentioned above.
