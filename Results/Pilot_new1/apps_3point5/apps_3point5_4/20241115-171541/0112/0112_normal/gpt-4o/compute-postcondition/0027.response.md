According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits left to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False. This means that the loop did not find a specific condition that would stop the loop. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **found is False**
