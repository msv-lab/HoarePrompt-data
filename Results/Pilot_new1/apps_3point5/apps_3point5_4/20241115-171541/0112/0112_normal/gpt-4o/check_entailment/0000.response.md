Initial assessment:
The code consists of two functions. The first function `func_1` calculates the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes by incrementing `x` until `can_form_number(x + 1)` is false. The second function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes provided. The code seems to be following the problem description by iterating through the digits of the number and checking if there is a cube face containing that digit.

Output hints assessment:
The output hints describe the functions accurately. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum number that can be formed by incrementing `x` until `can_form_number(x + 1)` is false. The `can_form_number` function iterates through the digits of the number and checks if a cube face contains that digit. The hints also mention that the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Final assessment:
The code seems to correctly implement the problem description by determining the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. The output hints also align with the code functionality. Since the code covers all potential cases and the output hints support the code's validity, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**
