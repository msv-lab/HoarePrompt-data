According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If digits is not an empty list, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` represents the number of cubes, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is not an empty list. Additionally, since used_cubes is a list of n booleans initialized to False, each boolean in used_cubes should be set to True to indicate that the cubes are being used.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive); used_cubes is a list of n booleans with all elements set to True**
