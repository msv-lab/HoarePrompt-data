Output State: 
If n is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop execution, if there exists a cube that has not been used yet and contains the digit in its faces, the corresponding element in used_cubes will be set to True, and found will be True. If no such cube is found, found remains False. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged.
**If n is at least 1, used_cubes will have at least one element set to True, found will be True if a cube with the digit is found, otherwise False. If n is 0, no changes occur in the variables.**
