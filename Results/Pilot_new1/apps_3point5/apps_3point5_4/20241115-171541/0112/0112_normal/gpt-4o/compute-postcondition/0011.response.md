Example Answer:
The ith cube in used_cubes is set to True, indicating that it has been used. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive); used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to True; found is True.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive); used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to True; found is True**
