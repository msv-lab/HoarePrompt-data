Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of cubes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, with each integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). used_cubes is a list of n booleans, with at least one element set to True. found is True. After the if else block executes, if the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is satisfied, used_cubes[i] is set to True, found is set to True, and the loop breaks. All other elements of used_cubes remain unchanged.***
