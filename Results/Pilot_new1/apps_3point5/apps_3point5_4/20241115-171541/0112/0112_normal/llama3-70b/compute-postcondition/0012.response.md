The code snippet removes '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is present in the set `digits`, after execution, '0' is removed from the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` contains all unique digits from 1 to 9 present in the cubes.
Output State: **`digits` contains all unique digits from 1 to 9 present in the cubes**
