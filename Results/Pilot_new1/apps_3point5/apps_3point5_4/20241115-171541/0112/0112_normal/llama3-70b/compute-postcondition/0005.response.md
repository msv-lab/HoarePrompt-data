According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube in the cubes list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 cubes.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube in the cubes list**
