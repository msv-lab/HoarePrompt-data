Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input values correctly, creates a list of cubes represented by lists of integers, extracts individual digits from the cubes, removes '0' from the set of digits if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them to form a number, and then prints the maximum number formed from the digits. The code logic aligns with the problem description as it effectively determines the largest natural number Masha can make using her cubes. Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description are consistent with the output of the code. The annotations also accurately describe the steps taken by the code to achieve the desired result. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
