Example Answer: 
The code joins the digits in the set `digits` after sorting them in descending order and converts the resulting string to an integer, assigning it to `max_num`. The set `digits` contains individual digits extracted from the cubes, excluding the digit '0'. After the execution of the code, the set `digits` is updated accordingly. 
Output State: **If cubes is empty, digits remains an empty set. If cubes contains at least one list of integers, digits contains individual digits excluding '0'. `max_num` is assigned the maximum number formed by sorting digits in descending order and converting to an integer.**
