Example Answer:
For each cube in the list `cubes`, the code converts each digit in the cube to a string and updates the set `digits` with these individual digits. Since the initial state is not provided for `cubes` and `digits`, the output state will depend on the cubes provided by the user input.
Output State: **`n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`; `digits` is a set containing the individual digits extracted from the cubes**
