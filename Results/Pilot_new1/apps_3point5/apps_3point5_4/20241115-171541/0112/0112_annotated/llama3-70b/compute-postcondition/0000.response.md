Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 3, the possible values for `n` are 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the possible values for `n` are 1, 2, or 3.
Output State: **Possible values for `n` are 1, 2, or 3**
