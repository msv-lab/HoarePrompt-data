Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of string representations of the integer `num`. The value of `num` is unknown in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of the cube, num is a positive integer representing the number to be checked for formation using the cube faces, and digits is a list of string representations of the integer num.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of the cube, num is a positive integer representing the number to be checked for formation using the cube faces, and digits is a list of string representations of the integer num**
