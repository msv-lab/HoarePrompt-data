According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values. If not used_cubes[i] and digit is in cube_faces[i], then the ith value in used_cubes is set to True and found is set to True.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- Ensure that `i` is still less than `n` to continue the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. If not used_cubes[i] and digit is in cube_faces[i], then the ith value in used_cubes is set to True and found is set to True, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is still less than `n`.**
