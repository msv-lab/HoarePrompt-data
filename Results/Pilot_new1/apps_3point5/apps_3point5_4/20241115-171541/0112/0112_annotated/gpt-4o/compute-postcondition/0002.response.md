According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the digits list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of the cube, num is a positive integer representing the number to be checked for formation using the cube faces, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num, and used_cubes is a list of n boolean values initialized to False. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values initialized to False**
