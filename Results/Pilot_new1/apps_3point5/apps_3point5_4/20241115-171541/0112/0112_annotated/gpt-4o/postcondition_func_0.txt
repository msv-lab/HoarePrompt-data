The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has received, and `cubes`, a list of n lists. Each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. The function then iterates through integers starting from 1 and stops at the largest integer x for which `can_form_number(x)` is true. Finally, it returns this largest integer x.
