Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts three parameters: `n`, `cube_faces`, and `num`. It iterates through the cube faces to check if there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces. If found, it sets the corresponding value in used_cubes to True, sets found to True, and breaks the loop. The loop will execute at most n times, depending on the number of cubes available. If no cube with the specified digit is found, it returns False. If there are no cubes available or the digits list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the output will be the same as the initial state. In the end, the function returns True if the specified digit can be formed using the cube faces, and False otherwise.**
