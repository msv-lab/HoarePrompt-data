According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values where the ith value is True if not already set to True, found is True if a cube with the specified digit is found in the cube_faces list, i is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is satisfied, the ith value in used_cubes should be set to True.
- If the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is satisfied, found should be set to True.

State: **n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values where the ith value is True if not already set to True, found is True if a cube with the specified digit is found in the cube_faces list, i is 1**
