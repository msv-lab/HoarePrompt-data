You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If can_form_number(1) is true, then x is 1. If can_form_number(2) is true, then x is 2. If can_form_number(3) is true, then x is 3. If can_form_number(x) is false for any x, then x is the largest integer such that can_form_number(x) is true.
    return x
    #The program returns the largest integer x such that can_form_number(x) is true
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has received, and `cubes`, a list of n lists. Each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. The function then iterates through integers starting from 1 and stops at the largest integer x for which `can_form_number(x)` is true. Finally, it returns this largest integer x.

#Function 2:
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces, the loop will set the corresponding value in used_cubes to True, set found to True, and break the loop. The loop will execute at most n times, depending on the number of cubes available. If no cube with the specified digit is found, found will remain False and used_cubes will not be modified. After the execution of the if else block, if found is False, the program returns False. If there is no cube available or the digits list is empty, the loop will not execute and the output will be the same as the initial state.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `can_form_number` accepts three parameters: `n`, `cube_faces`, and `num`. It iterates through the cube faces to check if there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces. If found, it sets the corresponding value in used_cubes to True, sets found to True, and breaks the loop. The loop will execute at most n times, depending on the number of cubes available. If no cube with the specified digit is found, it returns False. If there are no cubes available or the digits list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the output will be the same as the initial state. In the end, the function returns True if the specified digit can be formed using the cube faces, and False otherwise.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
