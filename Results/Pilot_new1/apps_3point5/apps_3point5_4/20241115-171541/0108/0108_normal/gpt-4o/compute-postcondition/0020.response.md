Postcondition: ***If the length of `s` is less than 1 or `target_len` is 0, the loop will not execute. If `s` is not empty and `target_len` is greater than 0, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be less than `target_len` and will represent the number of characters in `target` that match with characters in `s` starting from the beginning of both strings.***
