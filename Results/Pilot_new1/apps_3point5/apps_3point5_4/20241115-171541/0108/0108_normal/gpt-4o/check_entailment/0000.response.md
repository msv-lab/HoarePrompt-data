Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads an input string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, which matches the problem description.
- It then compares the characters in the input string `s` with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, incrementing the index of the target string only when a match is found.
- If the characters in `s` match the characters in the target string in order, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1.
- The code correctly handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target string as a subsequence by returning -1.
