According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `target_len`, and the length of string `s`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is an integer. This means that the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `target_len` is the length of variable `target`, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer**
