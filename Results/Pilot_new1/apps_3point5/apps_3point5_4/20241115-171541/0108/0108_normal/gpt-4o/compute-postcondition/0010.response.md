Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `target_len` is the length of variable `target`, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. The program handles all cases where the characters at index `i` in `s` and `j` in `target` are equal, resulting in the increment of `j`.***
