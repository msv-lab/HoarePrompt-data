Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. The function processes the input string `s` by comparing it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the characters in `s` match the characters in the target string in order, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1. The function iterates through the input string `s` and the target string simultaneously, incrementing the index of the target string only when a match is found.**
