According to the code, the loop can execute if the string `s` contains all lowercase English letters. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order, `s` has each character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, and `char` is the last letter in the alphabet. To execute the loop one more time, `s` should be missing at least one letter from the alphabet. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`res` is a concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `char` is the last letter in the alphabet**
