Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the string `res`. The value of `char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence, and `res` already has some characters added to it. After execution, the new value of `res` will be the concatenation of the previous value of `res` and the next character in ASCII sequence of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has the updated value after adding `char` to it.
Output State: **`char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has the updated value after adding `char` to it**
