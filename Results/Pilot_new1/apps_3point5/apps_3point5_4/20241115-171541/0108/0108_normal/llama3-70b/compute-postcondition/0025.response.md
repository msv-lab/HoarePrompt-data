According to the code, the loop can execute again if `char` is less than the last letter in the alphabet. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the last letter in the alphabet. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to the letter before the last letter in the alphabet.
State: **If `s` contains all letters from the alphabet, then `res` will be the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order. If `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `res` will be the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the missing letter(s). `char` will be the second to last letter in the alphabet.**
