Example Answer:
The character `char` in `s` is replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence, and the updated value is stored in `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has the updated value after adding `char` to it.
Output State: **`char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has the updated value after adding `char` to it**
