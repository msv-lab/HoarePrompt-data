According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, and `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, the missing letter in `s` needs to be added to `s` and `char` needs to be that missing letter.
State: **`res` is now the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `char` is the missing letter in `s`**
