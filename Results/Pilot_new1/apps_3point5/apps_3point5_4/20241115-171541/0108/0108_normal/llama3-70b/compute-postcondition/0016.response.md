Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. Since `char` is the last letter in the alphabet, it will be replaced with the first letter in the alphabet. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is now the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `char` is the first letter in the alphabet.
Output State: **`res` is now the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `char` is the first letter in the alphabet**
