Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` and iterates through the lowercase English alphabet. For each letter, it checks if that letter exists in the input string `s`, and if so, it appends that letter to the result `res` and replaces the first occurrence of that letter in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If all letters from 'a' to 'z' are found in `s`, the function prints out the complete alphabet in order. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles cases where not all letters are present or if `s` is empty. The output hints also confirm that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.
