Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, which is the second to last letter in the alphabet. The previous value of `res` depends on whether `s` contains all letters from the alphabet or not. If `s` contains all letters, then `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order. If `s` is missing at least one letter, then `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the missing letter(s). Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains all letters from the alphabet, `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order with the second to last letter added. If `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the missing letter(s) with the second to last letter added.
Output State: **If `s` contains all letters from the alphabet, `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order with the second to last letter added. If `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `res` is the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the missing letter(s) with the second to last letter added.**
