Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the value of `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is: res is updated based on the conditions, s is updated based on the conditions, char is the next character in the alphabet.
Output State: **res is updated based on the conditions, s is updated based on the conditions, char is the next character in the alphabet**
