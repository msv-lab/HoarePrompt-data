Example Answer:
The character 'char' is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet in the string 's'. The 'char' is the first character 'a' and it is replaced with 'b' as per the code. Therefore, the Output State is: s is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', res is 'a', char is 'a'.
Output State: **s is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', res is 'a', char is 'a'**
