Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the end of `res`. The value of `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will have the updated `char` at the end. The value of `s` is not affected. 
Output State: **`res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`, `s` is not affected**
