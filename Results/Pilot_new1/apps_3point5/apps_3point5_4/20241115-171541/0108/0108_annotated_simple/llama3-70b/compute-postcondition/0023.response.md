According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated by adding the next character in the alphabet after `char`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is updated by adding the next character in the alphabet after the updated `char`**
