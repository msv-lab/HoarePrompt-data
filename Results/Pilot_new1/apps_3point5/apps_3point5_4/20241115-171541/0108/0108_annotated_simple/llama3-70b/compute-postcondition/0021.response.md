Example Answer:
`char` is added to `res`, so the next character in the alphabet after `char` is added to `res`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `res` is updated by adding the next character in the alphabet after `char`.
Output State: **`res` is updated by adding the next character in the alphabet after `char`**
