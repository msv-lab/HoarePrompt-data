According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and `s`. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop does not execute. At the end of the last iteration, if char is in s, res is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the current char, s is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the current char. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet after the current character in `alphabet` should be in `s`.
State: **If the next character in the alphabet after the current character in `alphabet` is in `s`, res is updated with that character, s is updated with that character.**
