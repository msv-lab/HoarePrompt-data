Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet using the `replace` function. The `ord` function gets the ASCII value of `char`, adds 1 to it to get the ASCII value of the next character, and then `chr` converts it back to a character. The `replace` function replaces only the first occurrence of `char` in `s`. Therefore, the output state is: res is updated based on the conditions, s is updated based on the conditions, char is the next character in the alphabet.
Output State: **res is updated based on the conditions, s is updated based on the conditions, char is the next character in the alphabet**
