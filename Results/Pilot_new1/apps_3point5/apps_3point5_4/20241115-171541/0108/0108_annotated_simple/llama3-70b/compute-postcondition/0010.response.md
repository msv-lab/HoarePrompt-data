Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, where `res` is 'aa' and `char` is 'a'. After execution, `res` becomes 'aaa'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
