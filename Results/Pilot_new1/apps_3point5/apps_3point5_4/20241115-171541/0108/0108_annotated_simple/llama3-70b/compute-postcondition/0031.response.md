According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`, and `s` is not affected. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the current `char` should be such that the next character in the alphabet is still in `s`. Therefore, `char` needs to be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the new `char`, `s` is not affected**
