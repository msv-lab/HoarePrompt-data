According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the alphabet. Since the alphabet is fixed and always contains the English lowercase letters, the loop will always execute. 

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop will definitely execute. 

State: **s is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; res is an empty string, char is the first character in the alphabet 'a'**
