Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `target` is a string, `i` is an integer representing the length of `s`, `j` is an integer. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then `s` matches `target` in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is equal to 26. If `s` does not match `target`, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` is greater than the length of `s`, and `j` is equal to 26. After executing the code snippet, if `j` is equal to `target_len`, the program prints the value of `target` to the console. If `j` is not equal to `target_len`, the characters in `s` do not match the characters in `target` in order, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26.***
