You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s consisting of |s| small english letters.

In one move you can replace any character of this string to the next character in alphabetical order (a will be replaced with b, s will be replaced with t, etc.). You cannot replace letter z with any other letter.

Your target is to make some number of moves (not necessary minimal) to get string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (english alphabet) as a subsequence. Subsequence of the string is the string that is obtained by deleting characters at some positions. You need to print the string that will be obtained from the given string and will be contain english alphabet as a subsequence or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The only one line of the input consisting of the string s consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small english letters.


-----Output-----

If you can get a string that can be obtained from the given string and will contain english alphabet as a subsequence, print it. Otherwise print «-1» (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
aacceeggiikkmmooqqssuuwwyy

Output
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Input
thereisnoanswer

Output
-1
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    target_len = len(target)
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(s) and j < target_len:
        if s[i] == target[j]:
            j += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26. If `s` contains characters that do not match `target`, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` will be greater than the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26
    if (j == target_len) :
        print(target)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `target` is a string, `i` is an integer representing the length of `s`, `j` is an integer. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then `s` matches `target` in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is equal to 26. If `s` does not match `target`, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` is greater than the length of `s`, and `j` is equal to 26. After executing the code snippet, if `j` is equal to `target_len`, the program prints the value of `target` to the console. If `j` is not equal to `target_len`, the characters in `s` do not match the characters in `target` in order, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
