Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` from the input and compares it character by character with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1.

This logic ensures that the program will output the correct result for any input string `s`. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines whether it is possible to obtain a string with the English alphabet as a subsequence or not.
