Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `target` is a string. If `j` is equal to the length of `target`, then the function prints `target`. Otherwise, the function prints -1. The state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block depends on the relationship between the characters in `s` and `target`. If all characters in `s` match `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s` and `j` will be 26. If `s` runs out of characters before matching all of `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s` and `j` will be less than 26. If `target` runs out of characters before `s`, `i` will be less than the length of `s` and `j` will be equal to 26. In the case where both `s` and `target` run out of characters simultaneously, `i` will be equal to the length of `s` and `j` will be equal to 26.***
