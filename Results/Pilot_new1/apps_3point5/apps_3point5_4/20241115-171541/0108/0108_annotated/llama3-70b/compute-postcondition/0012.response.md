According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `char` must be in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character after one replacement. This means that the character before the last character in the alphabet has been replaced, so for the loop to execute again, the current value of `char` must be the last character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string with the added character**
