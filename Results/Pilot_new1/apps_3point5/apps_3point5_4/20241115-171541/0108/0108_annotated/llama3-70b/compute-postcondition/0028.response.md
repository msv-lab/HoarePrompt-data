According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` may have been modified with replacements and `res` is updated with the replaced characters. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` should still be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` may have been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`**
