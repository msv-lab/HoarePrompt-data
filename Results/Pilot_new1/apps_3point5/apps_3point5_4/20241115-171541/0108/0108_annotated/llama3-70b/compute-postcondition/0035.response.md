Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of the subsequent character in the `alphabet`, `s` is modified with the replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters. If `s` does not contain the subsequent character in the `alphabet`, `s` remains unchanged, `res` is updated with the concatenation of all the replaced characters. `char` remains in `s` after the loop finishes.**
