Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the new value of `res` will be the previous value with `char` added at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
