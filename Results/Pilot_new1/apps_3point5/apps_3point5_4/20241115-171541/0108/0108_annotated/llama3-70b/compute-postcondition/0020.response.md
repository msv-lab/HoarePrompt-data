According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` and `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet with the first occurrence replaced, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, and `char` is appended to `res`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet after the current occurrence in `s` needs to be present in `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` should contain at least one occurrence of the character after the current `char` in the alphabet.

State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the character after the current `char` in the alphabet with the first occurrence replaced, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, `char` is appended to `res**.
