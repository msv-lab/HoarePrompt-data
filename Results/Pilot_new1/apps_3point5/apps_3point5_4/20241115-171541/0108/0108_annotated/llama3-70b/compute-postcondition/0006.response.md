According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once. This implies that the character `char` has been updated in `s`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the updated `char` should still be present in the modified string `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
