Postcondition: ***d_queue and r_queue are not empty. The loop continues to process the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in votes. The values in d_queue and r_queue are updated based on the comparisons between d_index and r_index. If either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty at any point during the loop, the loop terminates. After the loop finishes, d_queue and r_queue contain the updated indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively. The values of d_index and r_index are the last popped indices from d_queue and r_queue, respectively.***
