Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for 'D' employees and one for 'R' employees. It then iterates through the queues, denying the right to vote to the employee with the lower index. If an employee is denied the right to vote, their index is pushed back by n to account for the next round of voting. The code accurately determines the outcome of the vote based on the final state of the queues. The output matches the expected output based on the problem description and examples provided.
