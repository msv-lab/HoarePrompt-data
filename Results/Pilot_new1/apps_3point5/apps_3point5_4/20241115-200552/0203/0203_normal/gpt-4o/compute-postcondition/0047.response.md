Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a string `votes`, processes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in `votes`, updates corresponding queues `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and then simulates a voting process by comparing indices. If 'D' queue is not empty at the end, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the voting simulation based on the input data.**
