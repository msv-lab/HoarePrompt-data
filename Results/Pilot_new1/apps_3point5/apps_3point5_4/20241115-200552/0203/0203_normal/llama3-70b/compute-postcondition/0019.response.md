Output State: If the fractions list is empty, the loop will not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain unchanged. If the fractions list has at least one fraction, the loop will iterate through each fraction, incrementing `depublicans` by 1 if the fraction is 'D' and incrementing `remocrats` by 1 if the fraction is not 'D'.
After the loop executes, the final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` will depend on the number of 'D' and non-'D' fractions in the list respectively.
**`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is the count of non-'D' fractions.**
