Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of employees and their fractions, counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' fractions, and then prints 'D' if the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of non-'D' fractions, otherwise it prints 'R'. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, ensuring the correct outcome of the vote based on the fractions of the employees. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
