Example Answer: 
The input is stored in the variable `fractions`. The value of `n` is the number of employees, and the input characters represent the fractions of depublicans and remocrats. Since the input is directly stored in `fractions`, the state of `n` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees**
