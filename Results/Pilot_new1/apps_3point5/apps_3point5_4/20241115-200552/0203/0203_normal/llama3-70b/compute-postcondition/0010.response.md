According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list having at least 1 fraction. At the end of the last iteration, the fractions list has at least 1 fraction. Depending on the fraction being 'D' or not, either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the fractions list still needs to have at least 1 fraction.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, `depublicans` and `remocrats` have been adjusted based on the last fraction processed, and the fractions list still has at least 1 fraction**
