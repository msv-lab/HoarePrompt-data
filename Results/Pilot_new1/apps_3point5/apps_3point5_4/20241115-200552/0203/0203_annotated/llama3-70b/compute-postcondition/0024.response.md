Postcondition: ***If `n` is a positive integer and `fractions` is a non-empty string, after the loop executes, `depublicans` will contain the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, and `remocrats` will contain the count of non-'D' characters in `fractions`. If `n` is 0 or `fractions` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0. In the if part, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
