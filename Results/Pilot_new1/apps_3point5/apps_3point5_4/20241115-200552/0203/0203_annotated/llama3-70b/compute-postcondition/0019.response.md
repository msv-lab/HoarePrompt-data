Output State: 
- If `n` is a positive integer and `fractions` is a non-empty string:
    - After the loop executes, `depublicans` will contain the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, and `remocrats` will contain the count of non-'D' characters in `fractions`.
- If `n` is 0 or `fractions` is an empty string:
    - The loop will not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0.
