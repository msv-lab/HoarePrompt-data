The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on the preconditions that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, and the input `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it performs certain operations based on the input fractions.
