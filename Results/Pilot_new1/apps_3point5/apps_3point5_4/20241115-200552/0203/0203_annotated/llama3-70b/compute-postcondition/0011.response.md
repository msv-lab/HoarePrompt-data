Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, and the next character in the `fractions` string will determine if `depublicans` or `remocrats` will be increased. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `depublicans` or `remocrats` increased based on the next character in the string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `depublicans` or `remocrats` increased based on the next character in the string**
