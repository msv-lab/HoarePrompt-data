According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If there are more characters in the `fractions` string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `fractions` is a non-empty string. If `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fractions` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `fractions` string must have more characters and the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `depublicans` or `remocrats` increased based on the next character in the string**
