Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, votes is assigned the input string representing the fractions of employees with at least 2 elements, d_queue is a list containing 0 if the first element in the votes string is 'D' and 1, r_queue is a list containing 0 if the first element in the votes string is not 'D' and 1, i is 1, and v is the second element in the votes string. If v is 'D', then the index i is appended to d_queue; otherwise, the index i is appended to r_queue. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if-else block.***
