Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, n is a positive integer representing the number of employees. votes is assigned the input string representing the fractions of employees with at least 1 element. d_queue is a list containing the indices of employees who voted 'D', r_queue is a list containing the indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If the votes string is empty, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty. d_index is assigned the value popped from the front of d_queue, and r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is appended with the value of d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue is appended with the value of r_index + n.***
