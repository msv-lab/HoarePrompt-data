Postcondition: ***d_index is assigned the value popped from the front of d_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n. Otherwise, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n. Both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. If d_index < r_index, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n. If d_index >= r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n.***
