According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, both d_queue and r_queue need to have at least one element in them. Additionally, the states of d_index and r_index need to be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned in the code.

State: **After the if-else block executes, n is a positive integer representing the number of employees. votes is assigned the input string representing the fractions of employees with at least 1 element. d_queue and r_queue are non-empty lists containing the indices of employees who voted 'D' and did not vote 'D' respectively. d_index is assigned the value popped from the front of d_queue, and r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is appended with the value of d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue is appended with the value of r_index + n.**
