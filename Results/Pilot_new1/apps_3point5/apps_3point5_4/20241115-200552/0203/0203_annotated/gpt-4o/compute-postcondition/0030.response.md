Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. Then, d_index + n is appended to d_queue. The value of d_index and n are not given in the initial state, so the final state after execution is: r_queue is updated after popping the front element, d_queue is updated after appending d_index + n.
Output State: **r_queue is updated after popping the front element, d_queue is updated after appending d_index + n**
