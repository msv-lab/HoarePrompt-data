Example Answer: 
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n+1` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are updated based on the last character in `fractions`, `remocrats` is incremented by 1.
