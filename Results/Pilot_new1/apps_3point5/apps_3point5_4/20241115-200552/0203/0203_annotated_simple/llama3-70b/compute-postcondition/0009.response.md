Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character. If the first character in `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If the first character in `fractions` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.***
