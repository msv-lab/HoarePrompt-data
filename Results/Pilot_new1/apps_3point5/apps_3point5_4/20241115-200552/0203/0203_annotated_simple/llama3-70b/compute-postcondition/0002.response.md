Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, and `depublicans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `depublicans` is 0**
