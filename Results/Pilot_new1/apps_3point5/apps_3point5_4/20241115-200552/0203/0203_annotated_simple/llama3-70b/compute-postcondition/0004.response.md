According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as the string is not empty. Since `n` is a positive integer, it implies that `fractions` has at least one character. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that `fraction` is the first character in the `fractions` string.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
