Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user and a string of votes. It then processes the votes to determine the final fraction of the majority party after alternating removal of one employee from each party until one party has no more employees left. If there are more 'D' votes, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input provided by the user.**
