According to the code, the loop can execute if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the `d_queue` and `r_queue` may or may not be empty, and `votes` may or may not be an empty string. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `votes` is not an empty string, then the loop can execute. Adjust `votes` to not be an empty string.
- Ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **Output State: If votes is not an empty string, d_queue and r_queue are not empty**
