Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, `n` are assigned values based on the input split into integers. `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. The condition `(a_floor > b_floor)` is false.***
