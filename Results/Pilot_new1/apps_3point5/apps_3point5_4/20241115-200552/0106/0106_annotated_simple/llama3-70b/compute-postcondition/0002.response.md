Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `a` and `m` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `a_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`**
