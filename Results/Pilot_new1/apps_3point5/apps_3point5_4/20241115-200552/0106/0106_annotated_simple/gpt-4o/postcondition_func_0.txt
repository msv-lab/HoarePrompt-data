The function func_1 accepts five positive integers n, m, k, a, and b. It calculates the total time needed to move from location a to location b within a building. The time is determined by the initial states of the locations and the building dimensions. If the starting floor is not the ground floor, an additional time is added to reach the ground floor. Then, it calculates the time needed for the shortest path between the two blocks, considering both direct and reverse walking directions. Finally, it adds the time to reach the target floor. The total time is returned as the output.
