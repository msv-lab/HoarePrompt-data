Output State: 
- If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is set to 0. 
- If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1. 
- `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15.
- `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.
