Example Answer:
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1 to the result. The value of `floor_within_block` and `k` are dependent on the value of `apartment`, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: Dependent on the value of `apartment`.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `apartment`**
