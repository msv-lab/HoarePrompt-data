Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, `b_floor` is an unknown value, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`**
