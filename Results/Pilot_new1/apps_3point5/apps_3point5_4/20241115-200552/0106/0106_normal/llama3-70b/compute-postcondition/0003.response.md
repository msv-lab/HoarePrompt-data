Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. The value of `a_floor` is already calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described**
