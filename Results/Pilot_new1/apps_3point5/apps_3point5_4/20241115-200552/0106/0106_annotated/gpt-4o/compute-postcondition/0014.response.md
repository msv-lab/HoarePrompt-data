Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts five positive integers n, m, k, a, and b as parameters. It calculates the total time required to move from location a to location b within a building with multiple blocks and floors. The time is calculated based on the block and floor locations of a and b, with additional considerations for the direction of movement and the target floor. The total time is returned as the output. If the floor number where a is located is 1, the time to exit is 0; otherwise, it is calculated based on the floor number. The function also determines the minimum walking time between blocks, the time to reach the target floor, and sums these times along with the time to exit to obtain the total time.**
