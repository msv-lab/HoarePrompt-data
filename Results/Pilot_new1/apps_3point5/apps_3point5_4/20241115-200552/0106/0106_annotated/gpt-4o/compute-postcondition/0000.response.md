Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are used in the calculation. Given the preconditions, the output state is: **Precondition**: **m, n, k, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k**; `block` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **Precondition**: **m, n, k, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k**; `block` is calculated based on the formula provided.
