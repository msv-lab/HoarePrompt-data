The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 
These parameters are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 
After executing the function body, the program returns the calculated total time stored in the variable `total_time`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept positive integers n, m, k, a, and b within the specified constraints and calculate the total time, returning it as the output. 
Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n, m, k, a, and b within specified constraints and calculates the total time, returning it as the output.**
