Output State: **`time_to_exit` is either 0 or 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1, `direct_walk_time` is the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is (n - absolute value of (block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15, `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**
