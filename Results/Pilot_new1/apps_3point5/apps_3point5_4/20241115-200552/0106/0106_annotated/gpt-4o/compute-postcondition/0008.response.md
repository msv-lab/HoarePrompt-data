Example Answer:
`time_to_exit` is calculated based on the floor number where `a` is located. If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - absolute value of (block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15.
Output State: **`time_to_exit` is either 0 or 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1, `direct_walk_time` is the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is (n - absolute value of (block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15**
