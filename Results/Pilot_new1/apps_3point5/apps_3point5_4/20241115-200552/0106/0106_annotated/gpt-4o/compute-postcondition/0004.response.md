The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameters `m, n, k, a, b` are integers such that `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`. After executing the function body, the program returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' calculated based on the formula `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and calculate the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the given formula.
