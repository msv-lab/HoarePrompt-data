Example Answer:
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `floor` is calculated based on the formula `floor_within_block // k + 1`.
Output State: **`floor` is calculated based on the formula `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
