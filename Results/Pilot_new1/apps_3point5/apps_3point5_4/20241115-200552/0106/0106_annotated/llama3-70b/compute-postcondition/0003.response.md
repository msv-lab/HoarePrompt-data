Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range. `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
