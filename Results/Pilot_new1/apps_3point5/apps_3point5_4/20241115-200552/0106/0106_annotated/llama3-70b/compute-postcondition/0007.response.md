Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input. `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. The condition `(a_floor > b_floor)` is true.***
