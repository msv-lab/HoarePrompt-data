Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence `a` and iterates through it to check if each element is double the previous element. If an element is not double the previous element, it increments the count of variables needed. The program then prints the count of variables if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic used in the program follows the problem description accurately, and for all potential cases, the program outputs the correct result.
