Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least one more element, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the `assigned` list. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is met, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `assigned`, `m`, `n`, `i`, and `can_form`.***
