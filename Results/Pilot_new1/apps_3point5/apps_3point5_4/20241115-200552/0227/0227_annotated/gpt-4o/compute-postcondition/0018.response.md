Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least one more element, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the `assigned` list. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is True, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
