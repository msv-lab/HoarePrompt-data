Output State: **`assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the `assigned` list. In this case, the loop is terminated. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values. If the assigned list is empty, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial values.**
