The value of `m` is assigned as 1. The set `assigned` now contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1.
Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1**
