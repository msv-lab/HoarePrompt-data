Output State: **If `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is not the last element in the `assigned` list, `a[i]` is different from `x`, and `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains True and the loop continues. If `assigned` has only 1 element or `x` is the last element in the `assigned` list, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains True.**
