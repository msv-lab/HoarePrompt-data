According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the `assigned` list. In this case, the loop is terminated. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `assigned` list needs to have at least one more element, and `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`assigned` has at least one more element, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the `assigned` list**
