Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of variables m such that they can help perform the sequence of operations described. However, the code provided does not implement the logic required to achieve this.

The code simply sorts the input list and then calculates the maximum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements. It then checks if this difference is less than or equal to 23 and prints the result. This logic does not align with the problem description.

The code should be checking if the given sequence of operations can be performed using a specific number of variables, which is not what the code is doing. Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the problem description.
