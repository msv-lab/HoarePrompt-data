Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user, then reads a list of n integers. It sorts the list and calculates the maximum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If the maximum absolute difference is less than or equal to 23, it prints the value. If it exceeds 23, it prints -1. If n is 1, the maximum absolute difference is 1. If n is 2 and the two elements are not twice each other, the maximum absolute difference is 2.**
