Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order; m is between 2 and n; i is between 1 and n-1. The loop iterates through the list a and increments m by 1 each time the current element is not twice the previous element. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] multiplied by 2, then m is increased by 1. If a[i] is twice the value of a[i - 1], m remains the same. If n is 1, the loop does not execute, and m remains 1. If n is 2, the loop executes once, and m will be 2 if a[1] is not twice a[0]. The code prints m if m is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.**
