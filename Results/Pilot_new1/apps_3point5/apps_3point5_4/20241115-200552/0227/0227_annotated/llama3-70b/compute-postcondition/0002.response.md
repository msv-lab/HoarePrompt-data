Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the list `a` contains n distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
