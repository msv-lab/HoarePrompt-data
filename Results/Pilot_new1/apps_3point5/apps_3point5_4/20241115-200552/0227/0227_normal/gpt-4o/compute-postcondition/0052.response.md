Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is set to True. In this case, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is not in the `assigned` list, `can_form` remains False.***
