According to the code, the loop can execute if the `assigned` list contains at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, the `can_form` is False does not affect the loop execution, so it can remain as it is. The state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute with the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the adjusted state should be: 
State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list**
