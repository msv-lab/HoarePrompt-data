Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the list remains the same with its elements rearranged in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**.
