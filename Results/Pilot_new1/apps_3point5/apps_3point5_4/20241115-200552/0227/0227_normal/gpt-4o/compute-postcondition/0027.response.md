According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. However, the initial state `can_form` is False, which means the loop will only execute if `can_form` is True. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `assigned` list has at least 1 element.
State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` list has at least 1 element**
