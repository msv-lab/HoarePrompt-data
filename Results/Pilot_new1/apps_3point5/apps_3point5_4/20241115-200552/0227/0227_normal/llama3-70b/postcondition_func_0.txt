The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers `a` also from input. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and iterates through the list to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element. If the count `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function works with a predefined set of positive integers, and the output is either the count `m` or -1.
