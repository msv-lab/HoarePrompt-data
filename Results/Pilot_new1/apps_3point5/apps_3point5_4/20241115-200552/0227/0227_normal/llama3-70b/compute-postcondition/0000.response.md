Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the input is constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 23, the value of `n` will be within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23**
