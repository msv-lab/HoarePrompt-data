According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer, `i` is one more than the value at the end of the previous iteration**
