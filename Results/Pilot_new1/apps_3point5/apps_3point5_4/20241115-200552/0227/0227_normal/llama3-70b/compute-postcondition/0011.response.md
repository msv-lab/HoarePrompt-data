According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
