Postcondition: ***If a[i] - x is not in assigned, then m is increased by 1. In this case, assigned is updated to a list with at least 2 elements where a[i] is added, and x is the second element in assigned. If assigned has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute. If a[i] - x is in assigned, can_form remains True and no changes occur.***
