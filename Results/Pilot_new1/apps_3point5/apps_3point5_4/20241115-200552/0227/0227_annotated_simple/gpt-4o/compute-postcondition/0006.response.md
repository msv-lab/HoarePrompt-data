According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` has at least one element. Since the smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to `assigned`, it already has at least one element. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `x` being the smallest positive integer from list `a`.
State: **The smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1, `a` has at least one positive integer, `assigned` set has the smallest positive integer from list `a`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the smallest positive integer from list `a`**
