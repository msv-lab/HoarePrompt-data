Postcondition: ***The smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. `m` is 1. `a` has at least one positive integer. `assigned` set has the smallest positive integer from list `a` and at least two more elements. `n` is greater than 1. `i` is 1. `can_form` is True. `x` is the smallest positive integer from list `a`. The difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the smallest positive integer `x` is in the set `assigned`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the smallest positive integer `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
