According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The initial state before the loop starts is `can_form` is False and `m` is 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `assigned` list must have at least 1 element, and `x` should be the first element in the list.
State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is 1, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`**
