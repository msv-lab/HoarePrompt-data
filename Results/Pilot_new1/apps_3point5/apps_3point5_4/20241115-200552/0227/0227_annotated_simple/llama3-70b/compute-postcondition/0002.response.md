Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains distinct positive integers, and after sorting, the order of elements is rearranged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
