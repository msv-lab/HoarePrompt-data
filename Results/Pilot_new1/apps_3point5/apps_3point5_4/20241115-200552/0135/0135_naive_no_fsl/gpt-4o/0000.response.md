Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description provided. It covers all potential cases where the remainders need to be distinct, so the program is correct.
