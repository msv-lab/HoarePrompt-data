Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values of n and k. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if that remainder has been seen before. If a remainder is seen more than once, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to a set of seen remainders. If the program reaches the end of the loop without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints "Yes". This logic follows the problem description accurately and should work for all potential cases.
