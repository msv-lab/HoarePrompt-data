Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the result of `n % i`, where `n` is the current remainder and `i` is 3. Since the initial value of `n` is unknown, the output state is: `n`, `k`, `seen` includes the current `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % 3`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `seen` includes the current `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % 3**.
