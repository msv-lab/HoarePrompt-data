According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `k`, `seen`, `remainder`, `i` remain unchanged. Since `i` is the variable that changes in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the previous iteration.
State: **`n`, `k`, `seen`, `remainder`, `i` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
