Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, `seen` is an empty set**
