Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` was already in `seen`, then the program would print 'No' and exit. Otherwise, `remainder` is added to `seen`. No changes occur to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `seen`, `remainder`, `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `seen`, `remainder`, `i` remain unchanged**
