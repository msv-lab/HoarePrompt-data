Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `k` can be any integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input**
