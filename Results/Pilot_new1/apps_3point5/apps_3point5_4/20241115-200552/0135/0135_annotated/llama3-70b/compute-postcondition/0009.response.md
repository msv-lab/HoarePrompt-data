According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `remainder` have specific values. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is positive, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
