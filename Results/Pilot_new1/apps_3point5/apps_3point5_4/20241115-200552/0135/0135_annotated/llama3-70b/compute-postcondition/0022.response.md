Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute and check if there are any repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, 'No' is printed and the loop exits. If no repeated remainders are found, all unique remainders are added to the seen set. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute.**
