According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to k (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be a positive integer value. Since `seen` is an empty set, it does not impact the loop execution in this case.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input where `k` is a positive integer, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
