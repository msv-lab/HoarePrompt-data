Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the result of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The initial value of `n` is unknown, but `i` is 2. Therefore, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. The set `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, and `k` is a positive integer. 
Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is positive, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i**
