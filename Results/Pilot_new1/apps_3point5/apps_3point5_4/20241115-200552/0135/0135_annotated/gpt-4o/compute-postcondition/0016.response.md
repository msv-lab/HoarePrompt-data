The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. In all other cases where k is less than n, the program does not return anything.

Case_2: If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. If k is less than n, the loop checks for unique remainders of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds each unique remainder to the set seen_remainders.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, it returns 'No'. If k is less than n, it checks for unique remainders of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.
