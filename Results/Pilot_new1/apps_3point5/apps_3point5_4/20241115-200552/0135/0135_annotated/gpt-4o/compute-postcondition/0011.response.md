According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2**
