According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is less than n. Before the loop starts, k needs to be less than n for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, the initial value of i should be 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
