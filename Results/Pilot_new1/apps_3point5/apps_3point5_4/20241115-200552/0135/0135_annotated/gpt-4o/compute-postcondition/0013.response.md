According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is less than n. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 4.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 3**
