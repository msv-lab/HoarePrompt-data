Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of n divided by i for i from 1 to k are distinct. If any remainder is found to be already seen before, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the remainders are distinct or not.
