The function reads two integers n and k from the input, then iterates from 1 to k checking the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is already in the set 'seen', it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to 'seen' for each iteration. Finally, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not calculate or return the result of the expression (n + k) * (n - k) as indicated in the annotations.
