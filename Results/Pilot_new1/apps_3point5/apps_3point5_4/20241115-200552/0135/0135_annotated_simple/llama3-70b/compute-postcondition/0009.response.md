According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i**
