Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by keeping track of seen remainders in a set. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k and calculates the remainder of n divided by i. If the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, it returns "No" indicating that there are duplicate remainders. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes", indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
