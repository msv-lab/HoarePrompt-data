Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks whether all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and exits early if a duplicate remainder is found. The program then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases where duplicates might occur.
