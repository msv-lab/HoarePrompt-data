Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `n` is assigned a valid value, and `i` is 2. The value of `remainder` is updated accordingly. Since the initial value of `remainder` is 0, the new value of `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` divided by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 2.
Output State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 2**
