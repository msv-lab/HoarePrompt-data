Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`, where `i` is 3. The value of `n` is already assigned, and `i` is 3, so the value of `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 3.
Output State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 3**
