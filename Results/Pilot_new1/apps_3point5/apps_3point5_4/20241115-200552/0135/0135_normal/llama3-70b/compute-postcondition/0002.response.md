According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are already assigned values, and `seen` is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` and `k` have valid values (greater than or equal to 1), and `i` starts from 1. 
State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
