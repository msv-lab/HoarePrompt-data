According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` is an empty set. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` should remain as described, and `seen_remainders` should still be an empty set.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 10^18 and n > k, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
