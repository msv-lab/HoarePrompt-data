The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables n and k.

Case_2: The function checks for the remainder of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If any remainder is already in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the function continues.

Case_3: The function returns 'Yes'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers n and k, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
