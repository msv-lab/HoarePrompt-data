According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 10^18 and n > k, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 3**
