Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the string $s$ and then determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$ according to the problem description. It handles the case where there are an infinite number of such prefixes by printing -1. The logic for calculating the number of prefixes with the desired balance seems to be correct based on the given problem description. The program iterates through all test cases and provides the correct output for each one.
