According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, the balance is not equal to 0 and count is 0. So, for the loop to execute, the `prefix_balances` list must have at least 1 element, the balance is not equal to 0, and count is 0.
State: **`prefix_balances` list has at least 1 element, balance is not equal to 0, count is 0**
