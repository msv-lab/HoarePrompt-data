Output State: **`count` is an integer, initially 0. It is incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the conditions: (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. If `prefix_balances` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer.**
