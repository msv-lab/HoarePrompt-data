Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the string `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the data list. The resulting `prefix_balances` list will have at least 3 elements. `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the data list. `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the data list. `index` is increased by 3. The loop updates the `prefix_balances` list based on the previous element's value and the condition of the corresponding character in the string `s`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the `prefix_balances` list remains with 0 values up to index `n`. When `balance` is equal to 0, the loop will be executed. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, then `results` appends -1; otherwise, if `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `results` appends 0. In the else part, `count` is an integer representing the number of times the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is met in the loop. Furthermore, `s` remains assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the data list, `prefix_balances` list has at least 3 elements throughout the loop execution, `n` remains assigned the integer value at index `index` of the data list, `x` remains assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the data list, and `index` is increased by 3 after each iteration of the loop.***
