According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` list is updated, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n+2`.
State: **`prefix_balances` list is updated, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+2`**
