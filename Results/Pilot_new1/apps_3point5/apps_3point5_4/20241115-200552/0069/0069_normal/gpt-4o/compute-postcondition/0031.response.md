Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, initially 0. `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1.***
