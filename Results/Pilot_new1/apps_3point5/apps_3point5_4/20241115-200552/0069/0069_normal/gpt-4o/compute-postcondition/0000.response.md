Example Answer:
The `input` function reads input from `sys.stdin`. Since no input is being processed or assigned to any variables, the initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **Precondition: T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n.**
