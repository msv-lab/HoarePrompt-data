According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the `prefix_balances` list is updated based on the calculation provided. `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`prefix_balances` list is updated based on the calculation, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`**
