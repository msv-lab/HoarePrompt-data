Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the running balance of zeros and ones in the string s and stores it in prefix_balances. The loop will execute at least once if n is greater than or equal to 1, and the resulting prefix_balances list will have at least 2 elements. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. The balance is equal to 0. x is not in prefix_balances***
