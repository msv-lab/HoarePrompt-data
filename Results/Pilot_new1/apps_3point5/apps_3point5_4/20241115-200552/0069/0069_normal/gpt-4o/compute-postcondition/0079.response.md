According to the code, the loop can execute based on the conditions related to `n`, `x`, and `balance`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `s` needs to be assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the data list for the next iteration.
2. The resulting `prefix_balances` list should have at least 3 elements for the next iteration.
3. `n` should be assigned the integer value at index `index` of the data list for the next iteration.
4. `x` should be assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the data list for the next iteration.
5. `index` should be increased by 3 for the next iteration.

State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` of the data list. The resulting `prefix_balances` list will have at least 3 elements. `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list. `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 4` of the data list. `index` is increased by 6.**
