According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be assigned the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` of the data list, `prefix_balances` list has at least 6 elements with updated values, `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list plus 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 4` of the data list, `index` is increased by 6, `i` is increased by 1**
