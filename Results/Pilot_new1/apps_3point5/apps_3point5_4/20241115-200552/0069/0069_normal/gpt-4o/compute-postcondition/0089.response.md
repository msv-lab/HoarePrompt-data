Example Answer:
The value of `n` is calculated as the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` must be less than or equal to `n+1`. The `prefix_balances` list is updated based on the calculation provided. Each element in the `prefix_balances` list is calculated by adding the previous element with 1 if the corresponding character in string `s` is '0', otherwise subtracting 1. 
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list is updated based on the calculation, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1**
