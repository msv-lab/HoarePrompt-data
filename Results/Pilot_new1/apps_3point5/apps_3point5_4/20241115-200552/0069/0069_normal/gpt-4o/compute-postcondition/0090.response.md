According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` list is updated, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`. Since `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n+1`.

State: **`prefix_balances` list is updated based on the calculation, `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`**
