According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the `prefix_balances` list is initialized with 0s of length n + 1. So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and the `prefix_balances` list must be properly initialized.

State: **`prefix_balances` list is initialized with 0s of length n + 1, where n is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
