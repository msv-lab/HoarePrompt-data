Postcondition: ***T + 1 is a positive integer, n and x are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string s, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the input string s. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then print -1. Otherwise, if balance is equal to x, the output prints n + 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0), then print ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
