Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input for each test case and calculates the balance of the string based on the count of '0's and '1's.
- It then checks different conditions to determine the number of prefixes with the desired balance.
- The code handles cases where the balance is equal to x, prints n + 1.
- It also correctly handles cases where an infinite number of prefixes exist by checking if the difference between x and the balance is divisible by the difference in counts of '0's and '1's in the string.
- The code provides the correct output for all the given test cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.
