Output State: **T is greater than 1, index is 7, results is a list based on certain conditions, n is an integer value extracted from data at index, x is an integer value extracted from data at index + 1, s is from data at index 3, balance is calculated based on the string s, prefix_balances is updated based on the provided formula, x is either in or not in prefix_balances, s is from data at index 2, and balance is the count of '0' minus the count of '1' in string s, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of (n + 1), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated using the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
