Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the difference between `x` and the last `b` in `prefix_balances` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1. This holds true for all cases where the condition is satisfied, ensuring that `count` remains an integer throughout the execution of the program.***
