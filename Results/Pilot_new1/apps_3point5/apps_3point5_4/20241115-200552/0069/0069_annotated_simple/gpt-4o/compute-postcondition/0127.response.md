Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it based on predefined constraints, and calculates results according to the given conditions. It iterates through the input data to calculate balances and check for specific patterns. The function then prints the results obtained from the calculations. However, there seems to be a missing explanation or handling for cases where T is 0 or negative, which might lead to unexpected behavior.**
