Output State: 
If balance is not equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executes, `count` is increased by the number of times the loop executes. 
If balance is equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index i with more elements left in the list, `count` is increased by the number of times the loop executes.
In either case, if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, `count` is further increased by the number of times the loop executes.
If the loop does not execute at all, then `count` remains 0.
