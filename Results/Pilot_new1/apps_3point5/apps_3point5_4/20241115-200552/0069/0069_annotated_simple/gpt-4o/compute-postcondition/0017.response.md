Output State: T is greater than 0, index is 4, results is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `x` contains the integer value at index 2 of `data`, `s` contains the value at index 3 of `data`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's minus counting '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, and `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` for each index `i`. `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the formula provided, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n` inclusive. The code snippet `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` updates the values of `prefix_balances` based on the formula provided.
