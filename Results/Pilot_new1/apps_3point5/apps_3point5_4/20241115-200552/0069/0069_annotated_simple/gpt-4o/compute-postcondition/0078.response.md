Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index i. If n is less than 1, prefix_balances will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. If balance is equal to 0, then results will have either -1 appended if x is in prefix_balances or 0 appended if x is not in prefix_balances. If balance is not equal to 0, count will be incremented by the number of times the loop executes based on the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. The results list will have the final count value appended.***
