Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will update prefix_balances based on the formula provided. After the loop executes, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index i. If n is less than 1, the loop won't execute and prefix_balances will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1.**
