Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input:
```
1
4 1
1010
```
The expected output should be 4, as all the prefixes of the infinite string "1010101010..." have a balance of 1. However, the program will output 0 for this input. This is because the program is not correctly calculating the number of prefixes with the desired balance.
