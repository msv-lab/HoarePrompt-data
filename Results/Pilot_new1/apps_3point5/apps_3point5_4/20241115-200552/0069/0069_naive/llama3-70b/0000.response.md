Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ for each test case. It handles the cases where the number of such prefixes is infinite by checking if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the actual balance of the string $s$ is divisible by the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s in $s$. If it is, then it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes needed to achieve the desired balance. The program iterates through all the test cases and produces the correct output as per the problem description.
