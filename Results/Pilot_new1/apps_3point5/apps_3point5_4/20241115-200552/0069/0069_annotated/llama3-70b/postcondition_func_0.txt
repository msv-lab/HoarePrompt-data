The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`, calculates the balance between the counts, and based on the balance and `x`, it prints different values. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The functionality described by the annotations seems to align with the actual code logic.
