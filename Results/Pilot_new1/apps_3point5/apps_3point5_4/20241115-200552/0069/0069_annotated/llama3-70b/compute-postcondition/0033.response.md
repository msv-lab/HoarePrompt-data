Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 2, n and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, cnt0 and cnt1 are calculated based on the input string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0's and '1's in s respectively. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible scenarios including the edge cases where the denominator might be zero, ensuring the correct output is displayed.***
