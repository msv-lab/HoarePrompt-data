Postcondition: ***prefix_balances has at least one element, the balance is not equal to 0, count is 1. If ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0) are both true, then count is increased by 1. Ensure all edge cases are covered, such as when prefix_balances has multiple elements, balance is not 0, and count is initially 0.***
