Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `s` is assigned the value extracted from `data[index + 5]`, `prefix_balances` remains a non-empty list of integers with length `n + 1`, `n` retains the integer value extracted from `data[index + 3]`, `balance` remains unequal to 0, `results` contains the appended count, `x` retains the integer extracted from `data[index + 4]`, `index` is increased by 3, `count` is either incremented by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 holds true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false. `b` remains as the next element in `prefix_balances` that has not been iterated over yet.***
