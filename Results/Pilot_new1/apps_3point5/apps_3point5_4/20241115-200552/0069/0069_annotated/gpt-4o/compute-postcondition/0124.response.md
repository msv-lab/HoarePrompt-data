According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` list has at least two elements. To execute the loop one more time, the `results` list must have at least three elements.
State: **`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` list has at least three elements**
