Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers. The loop has executed at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with 0s. If `balance` is 0, the program either appends -1 to `results` if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, or appends 0 if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`. If `balance` is not 0, the loop iterates over each element in `prefix_balances`. If conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) are met for an element b, count is increased by 1. The size of `prefix_balances` remains the same, and the `results` list now contains the appended count.***
