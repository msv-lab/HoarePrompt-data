According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is assigned the value extracted from `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `n` is the integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` contains the appended count, `x` is an integer extracted from `data[index + 1], `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
