Output State: **`s` is assigned the value extracted from `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at that index, `n` is the integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` contains the appended count, `x` is an integer extracted from `data[index + 1], `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
