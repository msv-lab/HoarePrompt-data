According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the prefix_balances list. If there are still more elements in the list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, prefix_balances has more than one element, the balance is not equal to 0, count is 3 or greater. So for the loop to execute one more time, the prefix_balances list must still have more than one element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **prefix_balances has more than one element, the balance is not equal to 0, count is 3 or greater**
