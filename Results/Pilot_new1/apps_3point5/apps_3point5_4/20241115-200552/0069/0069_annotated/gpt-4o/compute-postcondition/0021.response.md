Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers. The loop has executed at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with 0s. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`***
