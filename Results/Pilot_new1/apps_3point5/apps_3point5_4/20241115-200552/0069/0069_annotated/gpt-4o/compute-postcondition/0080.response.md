Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is increased by 3. The value of `index` is not provided, so it is unknown. After the code execution, `n` will hold the integer value at the index position in the `data` list. Therefore, the Output State is: s is assigned a new value, prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is an integer value from data at index position, balance is recalculated, results is updated, x is a new integer value, index is increased by 3.
Output State: **s is assigned a new value, prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is an integer value from data at index position, balance is recalculated, results is updated, x is a new integer value, index is increased by 3**
