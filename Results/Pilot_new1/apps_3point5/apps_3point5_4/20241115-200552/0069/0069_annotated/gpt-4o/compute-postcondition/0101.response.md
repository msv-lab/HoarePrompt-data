Output State: **After the loop executes, prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of the values determined by the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) for each index i from 0 to n. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and prefix_balances remains initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1. The balance is not equal to 0, count is 0**
