Postcondition: ***s is assigned the value extracted from data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a non-empty list of integers with length n + 1, n is the integer value extracted from data[index], balance is not equal to 0, results contains the appended count, x is an integer extracted from data[index + 1], index is increased by 3, count is 0, b is the first element in prefix_balances. The difference between x and b is divisible by balance and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0***
