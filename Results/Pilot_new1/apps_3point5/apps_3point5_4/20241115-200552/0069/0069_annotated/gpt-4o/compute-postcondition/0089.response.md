Output State: **s is assigned the value data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is an integer value from data at index position, balance is recalculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in s, results is updated, x is assigned the integer value from data at index + 1, index is increased by 3, prefix_balances is initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1, n is at least 2, i is 2, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value of prefix_balances[i - 1] and the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), prefix_balances[i] is updated to the new value calculated.**
