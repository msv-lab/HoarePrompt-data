The function `func` takes an integer input `s` and converts it into its word representation. It covers the range of integer inputs from 0 to 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation by combining the tens and ones places with a hyphen if needed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return a value.
