Postcondition: ***s is an input integer where 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones list contains words for numbers from zero to nine, teens list contains words for numbers from ten to nineteen, and tens list contains words for multiples of ten from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 10, the code prints the word representation of s from the ones list. If s is between 10 and 19, the code prints the word representation of s from the teens list. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the code prints the word representation of s by combining the word representation of the tens place from the tens list and the word representation of the ones place from the ones list with a hyphen if the ones place is not zero. The postcondition covers all possible edge cases and scenarios of the program execution.***
