Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; `ones` contains string representations of numbers from zero to nine; `teens` is a list containing string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen; `tens` is a list containing string representations of tens from ten to ninety; n is an integer such that n is less than 11 or n is greater than 19. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number 'n' in the 'teens' list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of n from the `tens` list. Otherwise, if 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 != 0, the function returns the string representation of the number n between 10 and 99 in words, combining the tens and ones places with a hyphen. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of values and effectively handles edge cases.***
