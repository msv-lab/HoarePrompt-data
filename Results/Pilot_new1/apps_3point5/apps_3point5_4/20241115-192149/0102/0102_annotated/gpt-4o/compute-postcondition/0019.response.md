Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n within the range 0 to 99 and returns its string representation based on specified conditions. It handles cases where n is between 0 and 9 by returning the corresponding string from the `ones` list, handles cases where n is between 11 and 19 by returning the string from the `teens` list, and handles cases where n is between 10 and 99 by returning the string representation of the number in words, combining the tens and ones places with a hyphen. The function effectively covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of values and handles edge cases.**
