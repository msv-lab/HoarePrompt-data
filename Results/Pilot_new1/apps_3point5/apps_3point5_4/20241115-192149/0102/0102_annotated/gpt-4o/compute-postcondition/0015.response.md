Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; `ones` contains string representations of numbers from zero to nine; `teens` is a list containing string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen; `tens` is a list containing string representations of tens from ten to ninety; n is an integer such that n is less than 11 or n is greater than 19. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of n from the `tens` list if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number n between 10 and 99 in words, combining the tens and ones places with a hyphen. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of values and effectively handles edge cases.***
