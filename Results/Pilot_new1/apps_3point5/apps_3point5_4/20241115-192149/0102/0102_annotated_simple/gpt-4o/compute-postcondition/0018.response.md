The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 0 and 99. The function also utilizes the lists `teens` and `tens` to represent specific numbers. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is in the range of 0 to 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones`. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. For any other two-digit number, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` between 0 and 99 and return the appropriate string representation based on the conditions specified for different ranges of `n`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n between 0 and 99 and returns the corresponding string representation based on specific conditions met within the given ranges of n.**
