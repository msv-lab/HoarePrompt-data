Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from empty string to ninety, and `n` is an integer between 10 and 99 excluding 11 to 19. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list. All the boundary cases and edge cases are handled within the specified range and conditions.***
