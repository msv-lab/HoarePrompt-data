The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 0 and 99. The function also utilizes `ones` and `tens` lists of strings to represent numbers from zero to nine and tens from an empty string to ninety, respectively. 

The functionality of the function is as follows: 
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `teens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list.

The function handles all boundary cases and edge cases within the specified range and conditions appropriately. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n between 0 and 99 and returns the string representation of n based on the specified conditions using the ones and tens lists.**
