Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from an empty string to ninety, and `n` is an integer between 0 and 99. The function returns the string representation of `n` based on the following conditions: if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list; if 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `teens` list; if 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list; if 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list. All boundary cases and edge cases within the specified range and conditions are handled appropriately.***
