The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers. The constraints are that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After performing the specified calculations within the function, the program returns the value of 'x'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, perform certain calculations, and return the value of 'x'.
