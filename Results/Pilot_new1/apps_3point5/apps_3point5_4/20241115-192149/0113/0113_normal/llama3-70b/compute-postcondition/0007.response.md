According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `n % x != 0` is satisfied. In this case, `n` is increased by 1 and the new value of `n` is not divisible by `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `n` needs to be increased by 1 again and the new value of `n` must still not be divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is increased by 2 and the new value of `n` is not divisible by `x`, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
