Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a positive integer ranging from 0 to 8. The value of `k` determines the value of the multiplier, which is 10 raised to the power of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k**
