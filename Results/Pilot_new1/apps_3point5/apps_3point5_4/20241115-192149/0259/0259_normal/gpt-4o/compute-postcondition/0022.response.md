Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is set to i + 2 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the source and destination from the ith tuple in bus_routes. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all possible scenarios for the given program fragment.***
