Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a positive infinity. chosen_route is set to i + 1 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. For each bus route i, if s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If s_i < t and (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is set to 0. If s_i < t and ((t - s_i) % d_i) != 0, wait_time is determined as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. After the if statement executes, min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time among all bus routes, and chosen_route is updated to the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.***
