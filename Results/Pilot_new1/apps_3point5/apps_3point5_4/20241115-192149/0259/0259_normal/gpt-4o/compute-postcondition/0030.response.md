Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is set to the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions provided in the program fragment, chosen_route is updated to i + 2 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, wait_time is 0.
