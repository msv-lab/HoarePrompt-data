Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is set to the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions provided in the program fragment. chosen_route is updated to i + 1 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. If s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. After the if else block executes, min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time between the current min_wait_time and wait_time. chosen_route is set to the index of the bus route with the updated minimum wait time. All variables retain their initial values and relationships as described in the precondition. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases when determining the wait time for the bus route based on the conditions provided in the if else block.***
