The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates over each bus route in `bus_routes`, calculates the wait time for Serval at each route based on the arrival time and interval, and then returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. The function handles cases where Serval arrives before the first bus, when the wait time is 0, and when the wait time is based on the interval between buses. If `n` is 0, the function does not execute the loop.
