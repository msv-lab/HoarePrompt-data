Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are not provided in the initial state. The list `buses` will now contain the tuple `(s, d)`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
