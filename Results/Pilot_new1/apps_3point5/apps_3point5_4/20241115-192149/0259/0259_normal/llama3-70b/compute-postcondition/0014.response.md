Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value `-1`, and `min_time` is positive infinity. The value of `min_time` remains positive infinity as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1.
Output State: **`min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1**
