Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, each time adding a tuple (s, d) to the buses list where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input. If n is 0, the loop will not execute and buses will remain an empty list. t remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.**
