Output State: **`min_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum time calculated based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, incremented by 1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is an integer initialized to 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `min_time` will remain positive infinity, and `ans` will remain -1. The program prints the value of `ans`.**
