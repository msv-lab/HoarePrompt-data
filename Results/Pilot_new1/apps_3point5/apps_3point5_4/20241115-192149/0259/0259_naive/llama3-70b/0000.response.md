Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the time for each bus route, and determines which bus route Serval will use based on the minimum time. The program iterates through each bus route and calculates the time for each route using the formula `(t - s) % d`. It then updates the minimum time and the corresponding bus route number based on the calculated time. Finally, it prints the bus route number that Serval will use. 

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly determines the bus route Serval will use even if multiple buses arrive at the same time. Hence, the program is correct.
