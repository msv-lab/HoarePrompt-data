Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then reads the arrival time and interval between buses for each route and stores them in a list of tuples.
3. It calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus of each route, taking into account the interval between buses.
4. It keeps track of the minimum time difference and the corresponding bus route index.
5. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use based on the minimum time difference calculated.
6. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description, ensuring that Serval chooses the bus route with the closest arrival time to his own.
