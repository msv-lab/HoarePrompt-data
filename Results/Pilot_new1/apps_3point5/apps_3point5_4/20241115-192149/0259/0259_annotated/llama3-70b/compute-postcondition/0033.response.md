Output State: **`n` is incremented by the number of times the loop ran, `t` remains the same, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time` if `time` is less than `min_time`, `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1` if `time` is less than `min_time`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. If `buses` is an empty list, `min_time` remains positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1. `print(ans)` is executed.**
