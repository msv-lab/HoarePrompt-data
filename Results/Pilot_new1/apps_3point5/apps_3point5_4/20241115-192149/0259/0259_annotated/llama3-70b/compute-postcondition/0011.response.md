According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer incremented by 2. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 2 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 4, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with values assigned from the input after splitting**
