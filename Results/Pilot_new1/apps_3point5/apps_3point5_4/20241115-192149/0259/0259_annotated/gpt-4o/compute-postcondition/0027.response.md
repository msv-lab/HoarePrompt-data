According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the only variable that can potentially affect the loop execution is `min_wait_time`, which is updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `wait_time` must be less than the current `min_wait_time`, and it should update `min_wait_time` accordingly.
State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, all other variables remain unchanged.**
