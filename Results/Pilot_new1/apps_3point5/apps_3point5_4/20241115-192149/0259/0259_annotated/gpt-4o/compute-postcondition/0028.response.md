Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i].
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i]**
