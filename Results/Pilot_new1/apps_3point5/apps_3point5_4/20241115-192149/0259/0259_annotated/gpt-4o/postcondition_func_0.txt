The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the given conditions and returns the route number with the minimum wait time. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the bus route with the least wait time for Serval at the station.
