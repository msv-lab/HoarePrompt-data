Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1, `wait_time` is 0**
