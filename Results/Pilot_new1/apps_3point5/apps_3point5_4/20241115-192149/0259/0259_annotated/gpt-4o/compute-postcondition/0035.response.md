Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where the previous value of `chosen_route` is 2. Since the value of `i` is not given, the new value of `chosen_route` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` value is dependent on the value of `i`, `s_i` and `d_i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` value is dependent on the value of `i`, `s_i` and `d_i` remain unchanged**
