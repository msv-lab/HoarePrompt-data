According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Additionally, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` for the new value of `i` should be defined. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the destination of bus route 1**
