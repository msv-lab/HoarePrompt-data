Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i], `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i], `wait_time` is 0**
