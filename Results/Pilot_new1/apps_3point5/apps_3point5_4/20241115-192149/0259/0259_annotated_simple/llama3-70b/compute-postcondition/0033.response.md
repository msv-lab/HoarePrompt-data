Output State: If n is between 1 and 100 and buses contains at least one tuple (s, d), min_time will hold the minimum time, and ans will hold the index of the tuple with the minimum time plus 1. If n is less than 1 or greater than 100, or buses is empty, min_time will be positive infinity, and ans will be -1.
