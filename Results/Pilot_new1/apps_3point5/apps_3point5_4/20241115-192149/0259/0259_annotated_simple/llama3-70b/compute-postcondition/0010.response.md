Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list `buses`. The list `buses` now contains this newly appended tuple. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple (s, d).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple (s, d)**
