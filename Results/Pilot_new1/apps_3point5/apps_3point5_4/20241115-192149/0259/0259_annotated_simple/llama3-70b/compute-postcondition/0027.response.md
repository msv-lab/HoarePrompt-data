Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 3 tuples (s, d), min_time has been updated with the calculated time, ans is updated to i + 1 if the calculated time is less than the previous min_time, otherwise min_time and ans remain unchanged, i is 1, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d, ans is 2**
