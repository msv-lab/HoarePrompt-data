Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 1 tuple (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space. min_time is assigned the value of time if time is less than the current min_time, otherwise min_time retains its previous value. ans is assigned i + 1 if time is less than min_time, otherwise ans retains its previous value. i is 0, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d, and the overall state of the program variables after the if else block is executed.***
