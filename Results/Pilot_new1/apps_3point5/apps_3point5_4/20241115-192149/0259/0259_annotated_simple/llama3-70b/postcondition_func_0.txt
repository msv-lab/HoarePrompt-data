The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and the schedules of the buses. It then calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus and prints the index of that bus. If `n` is between 1 and 100 and there is at least one bus schedule, the function finds the bus with the minimum waiting time and prints its index. If `n` is outside the valid range or there are no bus schedules, it prints -1. The function does not have a return value.
