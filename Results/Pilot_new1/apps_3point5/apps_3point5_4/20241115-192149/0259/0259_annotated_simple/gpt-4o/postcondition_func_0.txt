The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route, respectively. The function calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on specific conditions and returns the route number with the minimum wait time among all routes. If `n` is 0 or negative, no route is chosen.
