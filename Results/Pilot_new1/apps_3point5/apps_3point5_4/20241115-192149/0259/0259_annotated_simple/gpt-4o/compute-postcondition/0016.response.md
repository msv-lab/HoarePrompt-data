Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. `chosen_route` represents the route with the minimum `wait_time`. The value of `min_wait_time` is determined based on the conditions provided in the program fragment, considering the scenarios where `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and the general case where `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios, ensuring the correct updating of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route`.***
