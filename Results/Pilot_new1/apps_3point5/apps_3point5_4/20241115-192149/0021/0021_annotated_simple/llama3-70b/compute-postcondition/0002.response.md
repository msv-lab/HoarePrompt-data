Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in the list `a` would be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0**
