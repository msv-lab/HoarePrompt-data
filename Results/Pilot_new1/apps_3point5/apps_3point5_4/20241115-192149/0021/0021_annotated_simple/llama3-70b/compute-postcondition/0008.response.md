Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, subtracts 1 from it, and compares it with `n - 2` to get the maximum distance. It also calculates the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and `n`, subtracts 1 from it, and compares it with `n - 2` to get the minimum distance. Finally, it prints the maximum of the maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or greater than 100, or if the list `a` does not contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
