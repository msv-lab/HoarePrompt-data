Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the element `1` in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of `1` in the list `a` is 0. Therefore, `min_pos` is assigned the value 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0**
