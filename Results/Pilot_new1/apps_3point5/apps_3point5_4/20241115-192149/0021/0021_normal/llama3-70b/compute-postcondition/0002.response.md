Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the value of `a` is a list of integers. The specific values of `n` and `a` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`**
