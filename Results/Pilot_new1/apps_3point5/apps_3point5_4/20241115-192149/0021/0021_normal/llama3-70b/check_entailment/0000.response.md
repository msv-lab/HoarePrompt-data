Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of integers `a`.
- It finds the positions of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`.
- It calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these positions and either end of the list.
- The code then prints the maximum of these distances or `n - 1 - min_dist`.
- The code handles the scenario where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array by calculating the maximum distance.
- It also considers cases where the minimum and maximum elements are closer to each other and provides the correct output by calculating the minimum distance.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output for each case.
