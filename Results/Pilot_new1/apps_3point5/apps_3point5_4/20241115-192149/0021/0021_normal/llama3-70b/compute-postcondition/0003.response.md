Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a` using the `index` method. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `pos1` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`**
