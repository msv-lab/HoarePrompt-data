Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list by finding their indices and considering the constraint that the integers in the list are from 1 to `n`. The code then prints the maximum possible distance by performing exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and the provided examples. The annotations also correctly summarize the functionality of the code.
