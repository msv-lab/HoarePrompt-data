Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, considering the constraint that the integers in the list are from 1 to `n`. The function prints the maximum of this calculated distance and `n - 1`**
