Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 0 and `n-1` in the list `a`, and prints this maximum distance. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
