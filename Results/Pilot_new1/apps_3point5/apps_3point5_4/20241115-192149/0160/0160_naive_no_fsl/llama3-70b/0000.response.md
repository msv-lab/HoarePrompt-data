Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates through the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The logic and implementation seem correct and cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
