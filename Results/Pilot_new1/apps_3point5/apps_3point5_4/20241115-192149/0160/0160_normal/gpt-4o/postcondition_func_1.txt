The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x` and finds all divisors of `x`. It then returns a sorted set of these divisors in descending order. The function correctly calculates divisors for a positive integer `x` using a loop and updates the divisors set accordingly. However, it does not handle negative integers or zero as input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
