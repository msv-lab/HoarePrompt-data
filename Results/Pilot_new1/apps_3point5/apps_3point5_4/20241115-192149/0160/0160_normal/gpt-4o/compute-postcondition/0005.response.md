Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x, x is a non-negative integer, i is 1. If x is divisible by i, the divisors set is updated with the values of i and x // i.***
