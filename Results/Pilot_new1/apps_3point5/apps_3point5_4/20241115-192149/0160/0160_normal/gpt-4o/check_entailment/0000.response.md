# Initial Assessment:
The code seems to be correctly structured to solve the given problem. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in the list and then finds all the divisors of the sum of the elements. It then iterates over these divisors to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The code appears to follow the problem description.

# Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints provide a clear explanation of what each function does and how it relates to the problem description. They also highlight a potential issue with negative integers or zero input for function `func_2`, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the output hints do not provide any conflicting information that could suggest the code is incorrect.

# Final Assessment:
Based on the initial assessment and the agreement between the code and the output hints, the code is correct in solving the given problem. The functions are implemented as described in the problem statement, and there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
