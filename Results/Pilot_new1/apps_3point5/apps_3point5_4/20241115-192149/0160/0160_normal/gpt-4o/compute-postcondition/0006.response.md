According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `divisors` is a set containing the divisors of `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x, x is a non-negative integer, i is 2**
