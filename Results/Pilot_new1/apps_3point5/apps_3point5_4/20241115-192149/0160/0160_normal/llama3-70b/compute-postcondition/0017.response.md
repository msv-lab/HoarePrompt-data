Postcondition: ***If N is at least 2, then `max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and divisible by `i` without remainder. After running the code, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`, and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
