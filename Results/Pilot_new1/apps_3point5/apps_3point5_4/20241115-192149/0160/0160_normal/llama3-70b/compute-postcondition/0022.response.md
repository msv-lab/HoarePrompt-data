Postcondition: ***If N is at least 2, then after the execution of the if statement, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i` without remainder. This condition covers all possible scenarios where `max_divisor` is correctly updated based on the given constraints.***
