According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and `A[i]`, `i` is incremented by 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `N`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 at each iteration, it should be adjusted to `i` incremented by 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and `A[i]`, `i` is incremented by 4**
