According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and `A[i]`, `i` is incremented by 4. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `N`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` + 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the current gcd and `A[i]`, `i` is incremented by 8**
