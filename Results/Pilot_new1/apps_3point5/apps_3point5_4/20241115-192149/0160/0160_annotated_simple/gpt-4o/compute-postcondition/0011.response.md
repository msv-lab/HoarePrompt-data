Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2. By adding `i` to `divisors`, we are including the square root of `x` plus 1 in the set of factors. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
