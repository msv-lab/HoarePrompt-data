According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` already contains factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1. `i` is an integer value equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 2`**
