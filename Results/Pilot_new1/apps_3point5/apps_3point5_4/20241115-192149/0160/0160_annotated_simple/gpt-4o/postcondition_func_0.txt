The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of positive integers. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'lst' using the math.gcd function. The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers in the list without leaving a remainder. The function then returns this greatest common divisor. If the list has only one element, the function returns that element as the greatest common divisor.
