According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to `i`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the previous iteration. Since `i` is currently 1, it needs to be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2**
