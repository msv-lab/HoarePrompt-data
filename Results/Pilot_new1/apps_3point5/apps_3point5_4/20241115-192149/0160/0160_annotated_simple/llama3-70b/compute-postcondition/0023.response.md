Postcondition: ***N is an integer. gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A. i is 2. If gcd % i is 0, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
