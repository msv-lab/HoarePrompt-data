Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`, where `i` is 3. If `max_divisor` was previously 0, it will be updated to 3. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 3, max_divisor is 3.
Output State: **N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 3, max_divisor is 3**
