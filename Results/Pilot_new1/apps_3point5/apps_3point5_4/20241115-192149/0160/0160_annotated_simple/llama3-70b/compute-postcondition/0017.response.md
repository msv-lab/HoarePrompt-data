Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If N is less than 2, gcd is the initial value of A[0]. gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 1. The gcd is divisible by i, and max_divisor is updated to be the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where the square of i is not equal to gcd.***
