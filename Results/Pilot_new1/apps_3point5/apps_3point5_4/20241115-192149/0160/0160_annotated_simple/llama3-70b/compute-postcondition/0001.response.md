Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The length of the list `A` is equal to the value of `N`, which is an integer between 2 and 500. The values of the elements in the list `A` are integers between 1 and 10^6. The variable `K` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N**
