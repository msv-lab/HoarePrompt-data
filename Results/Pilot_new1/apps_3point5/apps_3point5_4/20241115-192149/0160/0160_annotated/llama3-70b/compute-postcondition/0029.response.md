According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers. Based on the conditions mentioned, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then:
- `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`
- `gcd` remains unchanged
- `i` is updated to the new value for the next iteration

If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, no changes are made to `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i`.

State: **`max_divisor`, `gcd`, `i` are integers**
