According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, if `N` is at least 2 and `A` is a non-empty list, then `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions specified. If `A` is an empty list or `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` remains the first element of list `A`, `gcd` is at least 1, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned. If `gcd` is divisible by `i` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i` or `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, then the program variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.

State: **Based on the conditions specified and the end of the last iteration, adjust the state accordingly to determine the appropriate values for `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` for the next iteration.**
