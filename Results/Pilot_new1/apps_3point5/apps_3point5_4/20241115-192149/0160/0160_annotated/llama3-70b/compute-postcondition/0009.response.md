According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers; gcd is the greatest common divisor of the previous value of gcd and the element at index 3 in list A, i is 4, and gcd is updated according to the formula gcd = math.gcd(gcd, A[i])**
