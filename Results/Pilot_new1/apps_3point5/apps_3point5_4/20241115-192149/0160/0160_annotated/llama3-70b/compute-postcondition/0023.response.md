Postcondition: ***If N is at least 2 and A is a non-empty list, after the execution of the if statement, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i while maintaining the initial state of the program variables. If gcd is divisible by i and i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i. If gcd is not divisible by i or i * i is equal to gcd, then the program variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition. If A is an empty list or N is less than 2, max_divisor remains the first element of list A, gcd is at least 1, and i is 2. In all scenarios, the program variables are appropriately updated or retained based on the conditions specified.***
