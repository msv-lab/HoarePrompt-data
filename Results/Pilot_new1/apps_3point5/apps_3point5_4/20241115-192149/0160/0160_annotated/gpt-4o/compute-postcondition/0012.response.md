Example Answer: 
A new value is added to the set `divisors`, which is calculated as `x // i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the new value `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, and the value of `i` is now incremented by 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the new value `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, and the value of `i` is now incremented by 1**
