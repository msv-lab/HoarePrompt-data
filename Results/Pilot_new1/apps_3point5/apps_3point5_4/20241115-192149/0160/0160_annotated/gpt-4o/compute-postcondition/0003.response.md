Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1, the set `divisors` now contains all the divisors of `x` along with 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` along with 1, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, square root of `x` is at least 1**
