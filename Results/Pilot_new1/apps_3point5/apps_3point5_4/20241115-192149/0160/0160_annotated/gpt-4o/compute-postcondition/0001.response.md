According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range from 1 to the square root of x (inclusive) has at least one element. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and the square root of `x` is at least 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, square root of `x` is at least 1**
