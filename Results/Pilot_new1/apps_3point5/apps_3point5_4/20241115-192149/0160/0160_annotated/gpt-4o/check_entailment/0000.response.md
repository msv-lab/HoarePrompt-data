Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented based on their descriptions and annotations. `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers, which is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. `func_2` correctly calculates the set of divisors of a given integer and returns them sorted in reverse order, which is also necessary for the problem requirements.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
