According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the new value `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, and the value of `i` is now incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `i + 1`, and the square root of `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and added to the set of `divisors`.
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, the new value `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, and the value of `i` is now incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `i + 1`, and the square root of `x` remain unchanged.**
