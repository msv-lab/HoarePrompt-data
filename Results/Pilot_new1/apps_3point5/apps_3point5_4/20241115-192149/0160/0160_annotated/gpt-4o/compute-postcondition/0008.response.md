Example Answer: 
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` already contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and the value of `i` that has been added. After adding `x // i`, the set `divisors` now includes all the divisors of `x` up to `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the value `i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the value `i`**
