Example Answer: 
The code calculates the difference between x and y, then divides it by 2 and adds the remainder of the division. Since x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the difference between them will always be an even number. Therefore, dividing an even number by 2 will result in an integer, and the remainder will be 0. Thus, the output will always be half of the difference between x and y. 
Output State: **The output will always be half of the difference between x and y**
