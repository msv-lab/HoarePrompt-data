Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The logic used in the program is correct as it calculates the difference between x and y, divides it by 2 and adds the remainder if the difference is odd. This is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to reach the desired equilateral triangle side length. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
