Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by splitting the input into two integers. The input values are such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
