Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, then calculates and prints the result of ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2). The calculation involves finding the sum of all numbers between `x` and `y` (inclusive) that are divisible by 7 but not divisible by 5. **
