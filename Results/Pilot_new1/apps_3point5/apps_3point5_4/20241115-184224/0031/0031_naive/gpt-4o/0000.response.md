Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. It follows the given problem description by calculating the numerator and denominator using a loop, taking care of modulo operations, and finding the greatest common divisor to simplify the fraction. The program handles the edge cases where k is greater than 2^n and outputs 1 1 in such cases. Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the expected output.
