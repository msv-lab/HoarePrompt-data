According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 1.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value of shifting 1 left by n, numerator is updated by multiplying the previous value of numerator with the result of (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, denominator is assigned the value (denominator * total_days) modulo MOD, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
