The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function assigns the value 1000003 to MOD. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. The program handles the case where k is greater than the result of shifting 1 left by n, and it prints 1, 1 before returning.
