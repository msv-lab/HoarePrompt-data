Example Answer:
The value of p_total is assigned the value of denominator, which is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. The previous values of the affected variables are numerator and denominator. If k is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. If k is 0 or lower, numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1, and p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator.
Output State: **numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. If k is 0 or lower, numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1, and p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator**
