The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of `n` divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of `k` divided by (10^6 + 3). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainders of `n` and `k` divided by (10^6 + 3). 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, returns the remainders of n and k divided by (10^6 + 3).**
