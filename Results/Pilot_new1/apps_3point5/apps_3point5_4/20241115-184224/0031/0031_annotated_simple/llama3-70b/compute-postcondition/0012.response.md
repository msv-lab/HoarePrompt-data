According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the updated value after multiplying by `total_days - (i+1)`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is less than `k`, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying with `total_days - i`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the updated value after multiplying by `total_days - (i+1)`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is less than `k + 1`, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying with `total_days - (i+1)`**
