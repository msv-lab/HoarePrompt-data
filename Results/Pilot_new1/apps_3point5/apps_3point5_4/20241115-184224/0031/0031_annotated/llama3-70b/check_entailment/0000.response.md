Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem description. One of the potential cases that the code does not handle correctly is when the number of people to be interviewed `k` is less than 0. In the problem description, it is stated that `k` should be greater than or equal to 2, however, the code does not check for this condition and may produce incorrect results if `k` is negative.

Therefore, since the code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description, the correctness of the code is false.
