Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both being integers. It calculates the total_days as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Then, it iterates `k` times, updating the `numerator` and `denominator` accordingly. After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides both by this gcd, and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3). The functionality of the function is to perform these calculations and return the remainders. Missing functionality includes not handling cases where `k` is less than 0, which may lead to incorrect results.**
