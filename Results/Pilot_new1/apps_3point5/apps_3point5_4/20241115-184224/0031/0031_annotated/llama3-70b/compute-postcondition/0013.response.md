Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to 0, then after the loop executes, `numerator` will be the product of (total_days - 1) times (total_days - 2) times ... times (total_days - k), `denominator` will be the product of total_days times (total_days - 1) times ... times (total_days - k), where k is the number of iterations in the loop. If k is less than 0, the loop will not execute and `numerator` will remain 1, `denominator` will remain 1.**
