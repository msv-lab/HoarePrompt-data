Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to calculate the probability of at least two out of `k` people sharing the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days. The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, while the `func_2` function performs the necessary calculations to determine the probability and outputs the irreducible fraction modulo `10^6 + 3`.

The `func_2` function correctly handles the cases where `k` is greater than `2^n` by outputting 1 1, as stated in the problem description. For other cases, the function calculates the probability correctly and outputs the values of `A` and `B` as required.

The code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and the provided examples also demonstrate the correct functionality of the program. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
