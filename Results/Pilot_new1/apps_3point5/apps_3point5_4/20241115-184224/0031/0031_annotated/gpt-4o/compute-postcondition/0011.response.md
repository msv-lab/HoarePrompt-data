According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
