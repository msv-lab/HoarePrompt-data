Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `numerator` with `(total_days - i)` and then taking the modulo `MOD`**
