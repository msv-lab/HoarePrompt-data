The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It then iteratively updates the values of `a` and `b` based on calculations until `b` becomes 0. After the loop execution, the function returns the final value of integer `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to perform a mathematical operation on the input integers `a` and `b` and return the resulting value of `a`.
