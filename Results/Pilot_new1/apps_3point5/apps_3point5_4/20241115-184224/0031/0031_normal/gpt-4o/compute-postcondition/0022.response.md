Example Answer: 
`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation. The values of `p_total` and `denominator` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to `p_shared`.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to `p_shared`**
