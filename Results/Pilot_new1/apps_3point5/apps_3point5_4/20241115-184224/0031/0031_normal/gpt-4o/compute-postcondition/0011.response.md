According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000003, if k is greater than 0, `numerator` is the result of the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after multiplying by `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`, total_days is 1, `i` is 1**
