Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `A` and `B`, where `A` is equal to `p_shared` and `B` is equal to `denominator`. The function `func_1` will perform some calculations and return a value. The values of `p_total` and `p_shared` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `denominator`**
