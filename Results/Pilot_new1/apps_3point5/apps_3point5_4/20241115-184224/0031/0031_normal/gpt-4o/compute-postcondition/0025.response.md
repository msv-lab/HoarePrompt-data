Example Answer:
The value of `A` is updated by performing integer division by `g`, but the previous values of `A` and `g` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to the updated value after integer division by `g`, `B` is equal to `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to the updated value after integer division by `g`, `B` is equal to `denominator`**
