Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by the result of `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The previous values of the variables are `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. After the calculation, the new value of `numerator` is `numerator * (2**n - i)`. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2**n - i)`, `denominator` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
