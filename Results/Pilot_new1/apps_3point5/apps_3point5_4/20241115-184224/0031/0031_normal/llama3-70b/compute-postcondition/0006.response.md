According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `i + 1`.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration, `k` remains the same**
