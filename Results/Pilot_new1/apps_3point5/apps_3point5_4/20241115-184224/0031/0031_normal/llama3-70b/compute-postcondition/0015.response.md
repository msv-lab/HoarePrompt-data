Output State: **If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `total_days` remains 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to the product of `numerator` and the decreasing values of `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is updated to the product of `denominator` and `total_days`, and `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. Finally, `numerator` is divided by `gcd`.**
