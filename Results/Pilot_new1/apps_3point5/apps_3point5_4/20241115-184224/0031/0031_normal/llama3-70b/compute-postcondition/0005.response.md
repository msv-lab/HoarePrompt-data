Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The previous value of `denominator` is unknown, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`**
