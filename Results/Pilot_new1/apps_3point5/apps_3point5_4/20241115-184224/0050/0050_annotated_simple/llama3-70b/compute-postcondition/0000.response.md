Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
