Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input correctly and calculates the minimum buy price from the list `s` and the maximum sell price from the list `b`. It then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, and if so, it prints the initial amount of bourles `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, calculates the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and finally determines the total amount of bourles after selling the maximum shares at the maximum sell price. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring the maximum profit is calculated accurately.
