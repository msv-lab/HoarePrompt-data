Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `r`. Since there are no operations or changes to any variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. The maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price.**
