Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the list of integers obtained from the input by splitting the input string. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers from the input**
