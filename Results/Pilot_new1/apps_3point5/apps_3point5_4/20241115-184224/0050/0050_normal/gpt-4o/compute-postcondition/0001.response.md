Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input to integers after splitting it. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
