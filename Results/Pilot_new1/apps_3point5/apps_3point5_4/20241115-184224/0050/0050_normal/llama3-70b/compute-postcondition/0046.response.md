Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, followed by lists `s` and `b`. It then sorts the lists `s` and `b`. The function calculates the number of shares based on the values in `s` and `r`, updates `r` accordingly, and then adjusts `r` based on the values in `b`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `r`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
