Example Answer:
The input is split into a list of integers and assigned to variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
