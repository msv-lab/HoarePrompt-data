Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is already 0, `r` remains greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` remains 0, `m` remains greater than 1, `n` remains greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
