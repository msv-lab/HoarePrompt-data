The function reads input for buying and selling prices of shares, calculates the total profit earned from selling shares based on the prices, and prints the total profit. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total profit from selling those shares along with the remaining money.
