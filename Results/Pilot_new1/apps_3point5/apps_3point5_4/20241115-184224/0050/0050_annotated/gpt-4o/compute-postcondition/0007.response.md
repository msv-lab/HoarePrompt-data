Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. The maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price.***
