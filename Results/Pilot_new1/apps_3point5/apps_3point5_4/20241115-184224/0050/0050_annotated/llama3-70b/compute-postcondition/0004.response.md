Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000 and list `b` is sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000 and list `b` is sorted in reverse order**
