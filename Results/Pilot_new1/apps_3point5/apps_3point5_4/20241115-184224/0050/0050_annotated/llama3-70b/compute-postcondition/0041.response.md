Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s` plus `shares` multiplied by `b[i+1]` if shares is greater than 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop. `r` remains greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
