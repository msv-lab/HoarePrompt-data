Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then the program breaks out of the loop. This ensures that all possible cases are covered and the program maintains the specified conditions.***
