Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s` plus `shares` multiplied by `b[i]` if shares is greater than 0, `shares` is 0. If shares is not greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s`, `shares` contains the total number of shares, `r` is greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
