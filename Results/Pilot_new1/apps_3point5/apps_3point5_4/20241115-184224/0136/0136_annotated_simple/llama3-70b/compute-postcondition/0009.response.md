Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned input values after removing leading zeros. `a` is not equal to `b`. If the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `b`, the program prints '>'. The program executes correctly for all possible cases where `a` and `b` are not equal, considering both the '<' and '>' outcomes.***
