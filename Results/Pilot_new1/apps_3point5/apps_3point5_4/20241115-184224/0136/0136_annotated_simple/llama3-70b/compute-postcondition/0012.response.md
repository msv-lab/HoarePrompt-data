Functionality: ** The function takes two non-negative integers as strings, removes leading zeros, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first integer is less than the second, and '>' if the first integer is greater than the second. It covers all cases where the two integers are not equal, providing the correct comparison output. **
