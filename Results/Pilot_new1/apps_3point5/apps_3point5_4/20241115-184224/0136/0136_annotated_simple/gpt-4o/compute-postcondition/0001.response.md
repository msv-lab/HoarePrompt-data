Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the result of `data[0].lstrip('0')`, which removes leading zeros from the string. If `a` had leading zeros, they would be removed, and the updated value of `a` would be stored. The variable `b` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
