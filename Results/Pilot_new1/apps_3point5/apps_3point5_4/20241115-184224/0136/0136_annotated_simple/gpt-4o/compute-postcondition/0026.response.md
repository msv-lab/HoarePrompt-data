The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the sum of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which are represented as strings. The integers `a` and `b` are each non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return the sum of the two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings.
