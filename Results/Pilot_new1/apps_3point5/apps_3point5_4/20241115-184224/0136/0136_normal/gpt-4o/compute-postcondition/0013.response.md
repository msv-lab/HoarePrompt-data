Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with a value of '0'. In all cases, after the if block executes, `b` is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b` and `b` is updated to '0'.**
