Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with a value of '0'. After the if-else block executes, `b` is updated to '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, the comparison is made based on the numerical values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
