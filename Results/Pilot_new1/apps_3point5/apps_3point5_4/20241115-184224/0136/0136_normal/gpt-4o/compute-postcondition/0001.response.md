Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` is updated to have any leading zeros removed. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
