Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. The values of `a` and `b` are not equal, and the program successfully executes the comparison and output operation based on their relationship.***
