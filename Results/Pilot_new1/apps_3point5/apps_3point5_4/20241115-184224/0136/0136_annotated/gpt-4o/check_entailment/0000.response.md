Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code reads two non-negative integers as strings, removes any leading zeros, and correctly compares them to determine which number is greater or if they are equal. The code handles cases where the input strings are empty, treating them as '0'. The annotations provide additional insight into the logic of the code and confirm that it covers edge cases such as empty strings and non-leading zero representations. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all scenarios.
