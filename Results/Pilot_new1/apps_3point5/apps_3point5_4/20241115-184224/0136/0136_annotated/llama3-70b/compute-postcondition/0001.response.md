Example Answer:
The input is accepted and leading zeros are removed from the input string, which is then assigned to variable `b`. The value of `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a is an input non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, b is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros.
Output State: **a is an input non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, b is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros**
