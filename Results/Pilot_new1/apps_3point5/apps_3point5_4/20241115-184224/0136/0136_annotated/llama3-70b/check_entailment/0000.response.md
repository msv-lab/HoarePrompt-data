Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, compares them, and prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison. The code also takes into account the case where the numbers have leading zeros by stripping them before comparison. The annotations provided also accurately describe the logic of the code and confirm that it covers all possible scenarios when comparing the two numbers.
