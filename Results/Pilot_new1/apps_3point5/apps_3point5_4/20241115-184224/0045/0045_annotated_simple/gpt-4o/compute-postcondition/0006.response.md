Example Answer: 
The `sequence` list is created by multiplying each element of the range from 0 to `k-1` by `d` and adding `d`. The previous values of `d` and `k` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `n` is the input number, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `n` is the input number, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)`**
