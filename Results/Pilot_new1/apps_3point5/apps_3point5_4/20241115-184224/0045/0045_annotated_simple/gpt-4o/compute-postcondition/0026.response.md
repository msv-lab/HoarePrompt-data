The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition is that both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the sum of the first `k` positive integers, denoted as `min_sum`, is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.

Case_2: The program returns the sequence after the loop iterations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and return -1 if the sum is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the sequence after loop iterations.
