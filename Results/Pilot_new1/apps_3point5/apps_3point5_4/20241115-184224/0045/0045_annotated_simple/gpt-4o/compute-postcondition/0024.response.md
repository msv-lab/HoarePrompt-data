Output State: **`min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` are updated based on the number of iterations, `sequence` has specific values incremented by 1, `i`, `k` are updated during each iteration. If `remainder` reaches 0, the loop breaks. If `remainder` is initially 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the variables remain unchanged.**
