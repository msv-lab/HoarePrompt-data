According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` are decreased by 3, `sequence` has the value at index `i-1` incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, `k` remains the same. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` should be further decreased by 3.
- `sequence` should have the value at index `i-2` incremented by 1.
- `i` should be decreased by 1.
- `k` should remain the same.

State: **`min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` are decreased by 6, `sequence` has the value at index `i-2` incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, `k` remains the same**
