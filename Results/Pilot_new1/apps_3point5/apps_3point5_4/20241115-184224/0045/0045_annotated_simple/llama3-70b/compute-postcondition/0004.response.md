Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations `a, b = b, a % b`, where `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is the updated values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **Updated values of `a` and `b`**
