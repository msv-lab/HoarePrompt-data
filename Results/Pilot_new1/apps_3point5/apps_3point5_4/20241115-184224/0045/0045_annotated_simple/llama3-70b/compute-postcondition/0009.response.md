Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculates the greatest common divisor of their initial values, and returns that value. If `b` is a positive integer, the function computes the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` eventually becoming 0 after the loop. If `b` is 0 or `a` is less than `b` initially, the loop does not execute. **
