Example Answer: 
The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations. The new value of `a` is the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. Since `b` is truthy, the division will result in a non-zero remainder. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, and `b` is still truthy.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, and `b` is still truthy**
