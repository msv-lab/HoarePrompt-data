According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `b` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0 or False). At the end of the last iteration, the updated values of `a` and `b` are provided. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted to a truthy value. No other states need adjustment.
State: **Updated values of `a` and `b` where `b` is truthy**
