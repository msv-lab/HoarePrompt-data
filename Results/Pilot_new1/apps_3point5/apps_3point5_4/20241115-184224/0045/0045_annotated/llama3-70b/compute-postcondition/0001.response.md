According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` evaluates to True, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are updated according to the given formula. To ensure the loop can execute again, `b` needs to be adjusted to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a and b are updated according to the given formula, b is True**
