Correctness: False

The provided code defines a function `func_1` which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `a` and `b`. However, the problem description requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to `n` and the GCD is maximal. The function `func_1` does not generate such a sequence.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case as it does not address the main task of creating a strictly increasing sequence with the specified properties.
