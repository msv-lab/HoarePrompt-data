The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It calculates the minimum sum based on parameter `k`. If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a sequence based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the minimum sum. The sequence is modified within a loop to distribute the remainder of the division evenly. Finally, the function returns the modified sequence.
