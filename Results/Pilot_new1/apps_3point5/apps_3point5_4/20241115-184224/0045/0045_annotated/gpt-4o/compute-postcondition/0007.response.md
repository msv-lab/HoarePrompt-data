According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the range specified in the for loop. The loop will execute as long as `k` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` do not have any impact on the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n**
