The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, if the min_sum calculated is greater than n, the program returns -1. In this case, there is no change in the state of the variables n, k, and min_sum. If the min_sum is not greater than n, the program returns the modified sequence after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers n and k, ensuring they satisfy the given constraints, and return either -1 if min_sum is greater than n, or the modified sequence after the loop execution.
