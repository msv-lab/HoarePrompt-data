According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value at the end of the last iteration + 1, `k` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the current value at the end of the last iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. `min_sum` is greater than n. `i` is the current value at the end of the last iteration. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 if remainder is not 0. `remainder` is decremented by 1 if remainder is not 0. If remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. `remainder` is decremented by 1.**
