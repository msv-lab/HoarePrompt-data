Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two positive integers n and k, then calculates the minimum sum of a sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If the minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the divisor d and remainder to create a sequence of k positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor. The program then adjusts the sequence to account for the remainder. The output is either the resulting sequence or -1 if no sequence is possible.

The program logic follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all potential cases. The program handles scenarios where the answer exists and where it does not, making it correct for all inputs within the specified constraints.
