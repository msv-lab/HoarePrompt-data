Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes two inputs, n and k, and then generates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n.
2. The program ensures that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximized by incrementing the numbers in the sequence from 1 to k while subtracting them from n.
3. If there is no possible sequence, the program correctly outputs -1.
4. The program handles the cases where n is less than k by outputting -1.
5. The program outputs the resulting sequence as expected.
