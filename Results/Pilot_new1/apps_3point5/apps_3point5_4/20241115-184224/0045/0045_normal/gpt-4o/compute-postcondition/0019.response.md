Output State: **`sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the new value of `remainder`, `remainder` is further decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
