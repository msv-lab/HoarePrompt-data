Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, the `sequence[i]` remains unchanged, and `remainder` retains its value. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues without altering the `sequence` list or `remainder`.***
