Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. Then, `remainder` is calculated as the difference between `n` and `d` multiplied by `min_sum`. The output state depends on the values of `min_sum`, `n`, and `d`. 
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`**
