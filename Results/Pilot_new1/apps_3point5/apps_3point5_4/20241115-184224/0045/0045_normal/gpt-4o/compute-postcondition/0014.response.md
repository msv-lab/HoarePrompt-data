Output State: **`min_sum` is greater than 0, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 2`, and if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
