The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1, denoted as `min_sum`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. 

Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns the updated sequence list after decrementing the remainder until it reaches 0 and incrementing some elements by 1 based on the initial value of the remainder. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and either return -1 if the sum is greater than `n`, or return the updated sequence list after performing certain operations on the elements.
