According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k - 1` to `0` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, and `remainder` is decremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should now be `k - 2` to ensure it stays within the range from `k - 1` to `0`, and the state of `sequence[i]` and `remainder` should be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the new value of `remainder`, `remainder` is further decremented by 1**
