Output State: **if b is greater than 0 then a is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, b is 0. if b is 0 then a is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, b is 0. if a is less than b then the loop doesnt execute and a remains the same, b remains the same**
