According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the previous value of the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to not equal 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is the previous value of the remainder of the division of the previous values of a and b, b is the remainder of the division of the previous values of a and b**
