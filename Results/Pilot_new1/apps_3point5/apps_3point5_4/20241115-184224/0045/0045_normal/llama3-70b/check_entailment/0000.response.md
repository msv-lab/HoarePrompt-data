Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It then checks if `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence of positive numbers.
- It then iterates from 1 to `k+1` and appends the numbers to `seq` such that the sum of the sequence is equal to `n` and the numbers are strictly increasing.
- If the length of `seq` is not equal to `k`, it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence.
- The code correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
