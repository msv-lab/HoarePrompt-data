Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to find a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n with the maximum greatest common divisor. The program calculates the minimum sum of k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If this minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 indicating that no such sequence is possible. 
If a valid sequence exists, the program calculates the common divisor d and the remainder. It then constructs the sequence by distributing the remainder among the elements of the sequence in a way that maintains strict increasing order. 
The program handles all possible cases and provides a correct output for each scenario. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
