Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1 which is the correct output.
3. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
4. The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to k and adds them to the sequence until n is exhausted.
5. If the length of the sequence is not k, it prints -1.
6. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence which satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
7. The program handles all possible cases as per the problem description and provides the correct output.
