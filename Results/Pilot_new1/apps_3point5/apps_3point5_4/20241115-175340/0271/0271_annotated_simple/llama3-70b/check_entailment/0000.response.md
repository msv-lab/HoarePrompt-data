Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a non-negative integer as input and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The program correctly handles the cases where the input number already ends with 0 by printing the input number itself. For numbers that do not end with 0, the program correctly rounds the number to the nearest multiple of 10, ensuring that the final output is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to the input number. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
