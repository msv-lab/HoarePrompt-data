Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is between 0 and 9. The value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, so the result is calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9. The value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the result of `n - remainder` calculation**
