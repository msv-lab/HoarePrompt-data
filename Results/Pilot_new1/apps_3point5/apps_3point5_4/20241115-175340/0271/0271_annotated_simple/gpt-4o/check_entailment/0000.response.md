Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes an integer input `n` and calculates the remainder when divided by 10. It then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, in which case it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. This logic correctly follows the problem description provided, and for all possible cases of input, the program produces the expected output.
