Example Answer:
The code prints the result of n - n % 10. Since n is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the result will be the number formed by keeping the tens place digit of n and making the units place digit 0. For example, if n is 46, the result will be 40. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5**
