Functionality: **The function accepts user input for an integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, computes a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the difference between `n` and the remainder. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, the result is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`. The function then prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
