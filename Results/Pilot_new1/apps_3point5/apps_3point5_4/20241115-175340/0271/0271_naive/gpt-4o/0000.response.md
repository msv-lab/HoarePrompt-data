Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It checks the remainder of the number when divided by 10, and based on that, it either subtracts the remainder from the number or adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to the number to get the rounded result. The logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
