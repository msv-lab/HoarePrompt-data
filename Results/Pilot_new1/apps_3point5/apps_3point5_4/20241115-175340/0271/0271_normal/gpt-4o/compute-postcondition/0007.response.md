Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 0 to 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the result of subtracting `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`. In all cases, `result` is a non-negative integer.**
