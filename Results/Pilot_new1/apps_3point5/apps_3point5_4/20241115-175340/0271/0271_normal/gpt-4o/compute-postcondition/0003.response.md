Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated by subtracting `remainder` from `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is a digit from 0 to 5, the result will vary based on these values. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 0 to 5, `result` is the result of subtracting `remainder` from `n`**
