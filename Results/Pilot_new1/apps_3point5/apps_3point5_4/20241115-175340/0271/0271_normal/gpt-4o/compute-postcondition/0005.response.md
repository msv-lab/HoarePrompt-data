Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated as the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is a digit from 6 to 9, the value of `result` will be a non-negative integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 6 to 9, `result` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 6 to 9, `result` is a non-negative integer**
