The function reads an integer n from the user input. If n is divisible by 10, it prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, it adjusts n based on the last digit: if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it prints n minus the last digit; if the last digit is greater than 5, it prints n plus the difference between 10 and the last digit. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
