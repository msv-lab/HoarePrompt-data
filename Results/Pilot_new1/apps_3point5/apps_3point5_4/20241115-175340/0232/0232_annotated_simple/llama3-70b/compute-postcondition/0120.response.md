Output State: 
After the loop executes, if `found` is True, then `found` will remain True, `i` will be the index at which the condition was met, `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` will be a dictionary with updated counts for colors encountered, `j` will be the last value of the range, `color` will retain the value of `colors[j]`, and `color` will be present in `window_counts` if it satisfies the condition. If `found` is False, then `found` will remain False, and no changes will be made to the `window_counts` dictionary. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and the initial state variables will remain unchanged.
