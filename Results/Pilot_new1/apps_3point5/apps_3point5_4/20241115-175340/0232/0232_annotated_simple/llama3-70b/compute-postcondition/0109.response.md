Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `found` remains True, `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary where all counts are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts`, `j` is 4, `color` is updated to `colors[3]`, `color` is present in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented based on the loop, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0.***
