Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The input is split and converted to integers using `map` and `int`. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list containing the integers obtained from the input split, `counts` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`colors` is a list containing the integers obtained from the input split, `counts` is a list of integers**
