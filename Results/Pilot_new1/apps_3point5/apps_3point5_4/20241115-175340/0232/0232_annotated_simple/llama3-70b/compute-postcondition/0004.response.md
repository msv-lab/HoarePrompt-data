According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are colors in the `colors` list. Before the loop starts, the `colors` list must have at least 1 color for the loop to execute. Additionally, the `counts` list and `color_counts` dictionary do not affect the loop execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `colors` list has at least 1 color.
State: **`colors` list has at least 1 color**
