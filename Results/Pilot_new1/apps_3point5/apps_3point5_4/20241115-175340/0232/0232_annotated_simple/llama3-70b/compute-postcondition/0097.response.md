Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the program variables are in the following state: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary where all counts are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts`, `j` is 2, `color` is updated to `colors[j]`, `color` is present in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented based on the loop, and all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. If `color` was not initially in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 1.***
