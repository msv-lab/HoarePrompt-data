Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` has relevant entries for the loop, `j` is set to the value of `i`, `color` is updated to `colors[j]`, `color` is present in `window_counts` if it satisfies the condition, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `j` is less than `n`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
