Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the program state remains unchanged: `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` dictionary maintains the updated `color: 1` mapping, `j` is 2, `color` retains the value of `colors[0]`, `color` is still not present in `window_counts`, and all the values in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting. This holds true for all possible scenarios and edge cases where the color is not in `window_counts`.***
