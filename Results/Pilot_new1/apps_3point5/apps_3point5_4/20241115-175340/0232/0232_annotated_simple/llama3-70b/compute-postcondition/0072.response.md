Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean set to True, `i` is an integer set to 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` contains relevant entries for the loop, `j` is an integer set to the value of `i`, `color` is updated to `colors[j]`, `color` is present in `window_counts` if it satisfies the condition, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 2, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `j` is less than `n`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.***
