Example Answer:
A dictionary `desired_counts` is created by zipping the range from 1 to `m` with the list `k`. The keys of the dictionary are integers from 1 to `m`, and the values are taken from the list `k`. Since `m` is a positive integer and `k` is a list of `m` integers, the dictionary `desired_counts` is successfully created.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in list `k`.**
