Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop will continue to execute, decrementing the count of colors in `current_counts` until the condition is met. If there is any color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, the loop will not terminate. The values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged after each iteration of the loop.**
