According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n` and `found` is not true. If `found` becomes true, the loop will terminate. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is false, `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`found` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**
