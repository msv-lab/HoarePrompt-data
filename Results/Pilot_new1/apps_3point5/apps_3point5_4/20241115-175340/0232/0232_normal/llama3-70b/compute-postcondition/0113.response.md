Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True, `i` is incremented, `n` remains unchanged. `window_counts` is updated with `color` being assigned the value of `colors[i+1]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 0 and then incremented by 1. The loop or if statement is exited after this condition is met.***
