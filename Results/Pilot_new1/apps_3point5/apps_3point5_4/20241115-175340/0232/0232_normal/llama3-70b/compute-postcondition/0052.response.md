Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer. color is the color at index j in the list. If color is not present in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is assigned the value 1. If colors is an empty list, the loop does not execute and color_counts remains an empty dictionary. window_counts is a dictionary where color is assigned the value 1 if not present. j is the current iteration index. n is greater than or equal to i. If all counts in sorted window_counts values are equal to the corresponding counts in counts, found is set to True. If the loop does not execute, the initial state is retained. After the execution of the if statement, if found is True, the loop breaks and the program retains the state described in the precondition.***
