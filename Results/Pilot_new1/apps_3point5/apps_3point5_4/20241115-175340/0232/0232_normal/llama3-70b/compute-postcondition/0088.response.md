According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. The `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `found` remains false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `j` is set to `i`.
State: **`found` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is equal to `i`**
