Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split. The input is split into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `m`, the output state is `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n**
