Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`. If the condition in the if statement is satisfied, `found` is set to True, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `window_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the addition of `color` and incrementing its count, `j` is equal to the new value of `i+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i+1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, and the contents of `window_counts` are appropriately updated after the execution of the if statement.***
