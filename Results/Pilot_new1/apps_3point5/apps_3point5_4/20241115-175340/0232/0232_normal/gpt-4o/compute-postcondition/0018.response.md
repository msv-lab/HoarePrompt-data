According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` is updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right`. To execute one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to the next index after the last iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` is updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right+1`, where `right+1` is less than `n`**
