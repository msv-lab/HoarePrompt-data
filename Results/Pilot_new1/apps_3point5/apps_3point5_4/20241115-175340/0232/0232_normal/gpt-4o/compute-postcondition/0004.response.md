Example Answer: 
The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values where the count of `colors[right]` is increased by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values where the count of `colors[right]` is increased by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0**
