Output State: **If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts specified in `desired_counts` for each color, then the function returns 'YES'. The loop adjusts the counts in `current_counts` to match the desired counts for each color in `desired_counts` until the condition is met. If the loop ends due to reaching the desired counts, `current_counts` will reflect the desired counts for each color. If the loop ends due to `left` exceeding the limit, there will be discrepancies in the counts of colors between `current_counts` and `desired_counts`.**
