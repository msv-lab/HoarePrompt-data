Example Answer:
The count for the color at index `right+1` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `current_counts` and `colors` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right+1`, where `right+1` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`current_counts` is updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right+1`, where `right+1` is less than `n**.
