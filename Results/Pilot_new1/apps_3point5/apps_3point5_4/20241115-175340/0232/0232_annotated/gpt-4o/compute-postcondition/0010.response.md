Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict object with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1, and there is at least one color where the value in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program continues its execution with the next statement.***
