According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right+1` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the index `right+1` should be within the valid range of colors in `current_counts`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the color at index `right+2` should exist in `current_counts`.
State: **The value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right+2` exists**
