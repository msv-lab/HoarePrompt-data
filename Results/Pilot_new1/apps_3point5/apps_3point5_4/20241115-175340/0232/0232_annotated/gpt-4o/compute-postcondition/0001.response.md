Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a `defaultdict` object with default value `int()`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict object with default value 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict object with default value 0**
