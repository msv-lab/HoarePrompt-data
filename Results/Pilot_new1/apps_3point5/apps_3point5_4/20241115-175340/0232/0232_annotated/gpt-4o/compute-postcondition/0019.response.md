Example Answer:
The value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right+1` is incremented by 1. The affected variable is `current_counts` and the color at index `right`. The output state is the updated `current_counts` after incrementing the count for the color at index `right`.
Output State: **The value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right+1` is incremented by 1**
