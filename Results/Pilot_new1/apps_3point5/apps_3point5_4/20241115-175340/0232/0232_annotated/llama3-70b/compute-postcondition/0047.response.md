Postcondition: ***All values in `window_counts` are sorted and equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If a color was not in `window_counts`, a key-value pair was added with the color and value 0. Additionally, all values in `window_counts` are set to 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
