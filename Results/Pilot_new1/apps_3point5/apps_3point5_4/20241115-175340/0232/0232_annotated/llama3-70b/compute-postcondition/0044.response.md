Output State: **All values in `window_counts` have been sorted and are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If a color was not in `window_counts`, a key-value pair was added with the color and value 0. Additionally, all values in `window_counts` have been set to 0, `found` is True, and the loop is broken.**
