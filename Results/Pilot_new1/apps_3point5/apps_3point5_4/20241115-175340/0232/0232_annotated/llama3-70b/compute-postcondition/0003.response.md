Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and an empty dictionary `color_counts` is initialized.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and an empty dictionary `color_counts` is initialized**
