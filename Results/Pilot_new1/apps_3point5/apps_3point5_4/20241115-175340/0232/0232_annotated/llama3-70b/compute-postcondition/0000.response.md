Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split by space, and the values are converted to integers. Since the values are within the specified range, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n**
