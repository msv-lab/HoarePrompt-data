Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for `n`, `m`, a list of colors, and a list of counts. It then calculates the count of each color in the colors list and checks if there is a contiguous subarray of colors that matches the counts list. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
