Postcondition: ***colors list is not empty, found is True. color_counts and window_counts contain the correct count of each color. If color is already in window_counts, its count is incremented by 3. If color was not previously in window_counts, a key-value pair is added with color as the key and 0 as the value. All values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding targets in counts. If all the values in window_counts after sorting match the corresponding values in counts, the variable found is set to True and the program exits the loop. Additionally, window_counts contains the correct count for each color, including adding the color with a count of 0 if it was not previously in window_counts.***
