Output State: **After the loop executes, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the `colors` list. If a color is not in `color_counts`, it is added with a count of 1. If a color is already in `color_counts`, its count is incremented. If the `colors` list is empty, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
