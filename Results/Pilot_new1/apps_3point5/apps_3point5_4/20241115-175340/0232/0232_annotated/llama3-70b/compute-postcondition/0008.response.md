Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color_counts[color]` depends on the previous value of `color_counts[color]` and the value of `color`. The output state will be updated based on the new value of `color_counts[color]`.
Output State: **Updated values of `color_counts[color]` based on the incremented count for the specific color**
