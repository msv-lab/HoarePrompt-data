Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It then evaluates conditions based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` equals `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0', or if `z` is not 0, it prints '?'. If `x` is not less than `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not have a return value.**
