The function `func` reads three integers from input and calculates certain upvote and downvote ranges. It then determines whether to print '+', '-', or '?' based on the comparison of these ranges. If the sum of y and z is less than min_upvotes, it prints '+'. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, it prints '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not have any return value.
