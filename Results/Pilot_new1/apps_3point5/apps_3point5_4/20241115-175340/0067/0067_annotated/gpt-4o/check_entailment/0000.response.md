Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that if the sum of y and z is less than min_upvotes, the result should be '+'. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, the result should be '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the result should be '+'. Otherwise, the result should be '?' to indicate uncertainty.

However, the code in the provided function `func` only checks for the first condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) and prints '-' if true, otherwise it checks for the second condition (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) and prints '+'. If neither condition is met, it prints '?' without considering the third condition (sum of y and z < min_upvotes).

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the correctness of the program false. The annotations correctly summarize the behavior of the code, but the code itself does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description.
