Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by determining the result of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. It considers all possible scenarios where the result could be "+", "-", "0", or "?". The logic in the code covers all cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
