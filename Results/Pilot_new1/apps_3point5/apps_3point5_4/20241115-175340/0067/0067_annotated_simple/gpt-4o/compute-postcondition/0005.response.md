Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The sum of `x` and `z` is less than `y`.***
