Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and covers all possible scenarios and edge cases. It checks for the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes and prints the correct result based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The if-else blocks cover all possible combinations of x, y, and z, ensuring that the program outputs the correct result or reports uncertainty when needed. The annotations also accurately describe the logic of the code.
