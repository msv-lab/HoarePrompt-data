Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values of x, y, and z. It then checks the conditions to determine the result (+, -, or ?) as described in the problem statement. The logic covers all possible scenarios and outputs the correct result for each case. Additionally, the program handles the uncertain case by printing "?" when there are multiple possible results. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
