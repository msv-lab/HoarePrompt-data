Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the program prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the program prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the program prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, the program prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints '?'.***
