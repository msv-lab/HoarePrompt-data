Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integers as input representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown.
- It then compares the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+', which aligns with the description.
- If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-', which also aligns with the description.
- If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0' in that case, which is the correct behavior.
- If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?', as mentioned in the description.
- The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
