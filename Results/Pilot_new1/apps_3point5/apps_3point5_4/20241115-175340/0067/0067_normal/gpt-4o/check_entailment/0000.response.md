- It then compares the maximum upvotes with the minimum downvotes and the maximum downvotes with the minimum upvotes as per the problem description.
- If the conditions are met, it prints the correct result ('+', '-', or '?') as expected.
- The code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
- Therefore, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
