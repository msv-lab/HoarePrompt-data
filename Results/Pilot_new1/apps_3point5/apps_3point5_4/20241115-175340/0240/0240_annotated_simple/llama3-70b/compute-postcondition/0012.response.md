According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string. If the loop is to execute one more time, `s` needs to have at least one more character to iterate over. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string**
