According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string. For the loop to be executed one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be considered. If `c` is present in `t_set`, then it will be appended to `n`, otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string**
