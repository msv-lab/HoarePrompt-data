Example Answer:
If `t_set` is empty, the loop will not execute, so `n` remains unchanged. If `t_set` is not empty, `n` will be updated by adding `t` to it. Therefore, the Output State is: If `t_set` is empty, `n` remains unchanged. If `t_set` is not empty, `n` will contain the characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` plus `t`.
Output State: **If `t_set` is empty, `n` remains unchanged. If `t_set` is not empty, `n` will contain the characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` plus `t`.**
