According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string. To execute the loop one more time, `s` must still be a non-empty string. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string**
