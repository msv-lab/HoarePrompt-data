Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two parameters, s and t, which are strings of digits. It creates a new string 'n' by appending characters from 's' that are present in 't'. Then, it appends the entire string 't' to 'n' and returns the integer value of 'n'. If 't' is empty, the loop will not execute, and 'n' will be an empty string. The function returns the integer value of 'n' after the specified operations. **
