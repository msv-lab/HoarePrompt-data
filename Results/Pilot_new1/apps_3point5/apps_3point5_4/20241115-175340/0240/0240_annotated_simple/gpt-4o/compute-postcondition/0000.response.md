According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` is a non-empty string and `sub` is a substring of `chars`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `chars` being a string representing a number and `sub` being a string representing a substring of the number does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `chars` is a non-empty string representing a number and `sub` is a substring of `chars`. 
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a substring of `chars`**
