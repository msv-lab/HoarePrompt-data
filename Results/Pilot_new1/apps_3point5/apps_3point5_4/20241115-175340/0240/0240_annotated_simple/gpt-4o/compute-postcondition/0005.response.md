According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string that is the result of joining `perm`. If the `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function with `sub` as a parameter, then the function yields `candidate`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of characters in the `chars` string needs to be generated. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is the next permutation of characters in the `chars` string.
State: **Next permutation of characters in `chars`**
