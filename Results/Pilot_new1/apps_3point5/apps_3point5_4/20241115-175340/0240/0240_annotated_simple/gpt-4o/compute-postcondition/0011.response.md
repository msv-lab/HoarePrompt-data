Example Answer: 
The code snippet `yield candidate` yields the value of `candidate` which is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation. The initial state mentions that the next permutation of characters in `chars` is available and `candidate` is a string formed by joining these characters. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is: Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation.
Output State: **Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation**
