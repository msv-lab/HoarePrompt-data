According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of characters in `chars` generated by `perm`. If there are more permutations available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the next permutation of characters in `chars` is generated as `candidate` by joining the characters of `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of characters in `chars` should be available. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the availability of the next permutation of characters in `chars`.
State: **Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available**
