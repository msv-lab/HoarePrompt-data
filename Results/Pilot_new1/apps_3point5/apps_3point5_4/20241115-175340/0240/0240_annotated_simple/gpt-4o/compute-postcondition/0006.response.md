Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The specific values of `chars` and `perm` are not provided, so the output state is `Next permutation of characters in chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of `perm`.
Output State: **Next permutation of characters in chars, candidate is a string formed by joining the characters of perm**
