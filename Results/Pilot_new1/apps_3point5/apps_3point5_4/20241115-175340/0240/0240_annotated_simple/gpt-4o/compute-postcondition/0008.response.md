Postcondition: ***Next permutation of characters in `chars` is generated as `candidate` by joining the characters of `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded. There are no other cases considered in this program fragment.***
