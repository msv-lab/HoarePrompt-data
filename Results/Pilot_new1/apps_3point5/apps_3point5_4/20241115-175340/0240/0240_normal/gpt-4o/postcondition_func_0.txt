The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub. It calculates the remaining characters in s after subtracting the character counts of sub from s. Then, it generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters and sub. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. If sub is empty, the function does not alter s_counter, and the smallest number is returned from the list of possible numbers.
