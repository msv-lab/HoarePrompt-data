Based on the code provided and the problem description, the program seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function takes two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the character counts of `sub` from `s`, generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters and `sub`, and returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. If `sub` is empty, the function does not alter `s_counter`, and the smallest number is returned from the list of possible numbers.
- The `is_valid_number` function checks if the substring `sub` is found in the large integer `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`.
- The `generate_possible_numbers` function iterates through all permutations of `chars` and checks if each permutation forms a valid number with respect to `sub`. If a valid number is found, it yields that number. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute.
- The program reads the input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result.

The program seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the output hints provided also align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct.
