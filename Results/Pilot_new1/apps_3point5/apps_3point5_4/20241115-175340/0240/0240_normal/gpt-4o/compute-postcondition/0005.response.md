According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` list. If the list has more permutations left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty list, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number`, then the function yields `candidate`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `chars` list must have more permutations left, and the `perm` should be the next permutation in line.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`**
