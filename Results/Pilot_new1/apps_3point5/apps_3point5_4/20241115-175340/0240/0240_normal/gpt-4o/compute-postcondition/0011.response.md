Example Answer: 
The code snippet yields the `candidate` string, which represents the next permutation of `chars`. The states of `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, and `candidate` are updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`**
