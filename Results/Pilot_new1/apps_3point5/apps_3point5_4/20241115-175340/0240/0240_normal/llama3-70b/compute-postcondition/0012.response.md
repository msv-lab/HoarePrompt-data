According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` still has characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if the next character in `s` is in `t_set`. If it is, then it should be appended to the string `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` based on the next character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` with possible modifications based on the next character in `s` and `t_set`**
