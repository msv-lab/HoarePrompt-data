Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by the value of the next character in `s`, denoted as `c`. The previous value of `n` is required to calculate the result accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a valid substring of `s`, `t_set` contains unique characters from `t`, and `n` is incremented by the value of the next character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a valid substring of `s`, `t_set` contains unique characters from `t`, and `n` is incremented by the value of the next character in `s`**
