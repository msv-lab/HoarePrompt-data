Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect the previous values of `s`, `t`, or `t_set`. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing unique characters from t, n is an empty string.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a substring of s, t_set is a set containing unique characters from t, n is an empty string**
