According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation needs to be generated. This means adjusting the states as follows:
State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`**
