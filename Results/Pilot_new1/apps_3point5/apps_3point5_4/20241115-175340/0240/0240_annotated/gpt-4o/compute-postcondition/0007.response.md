Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. The initial state includes `chars` as a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` as a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` as the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` as the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. After execution, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`**
