Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`**
