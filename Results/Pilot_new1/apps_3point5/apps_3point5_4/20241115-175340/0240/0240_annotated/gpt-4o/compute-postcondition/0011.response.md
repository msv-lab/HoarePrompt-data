Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which represents the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` are not explicitly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the code yields the next permutation represented by `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the code yields the next permutation represented by `candidate`**
