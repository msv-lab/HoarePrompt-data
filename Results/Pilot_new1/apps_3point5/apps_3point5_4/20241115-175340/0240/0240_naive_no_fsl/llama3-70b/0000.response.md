Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to find the characters that are in `t`. It then appends `t` to the end of the constructed string `n` and returns it as an integer. This logic correctly follows the problem description of finding the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the provided substring `t`. The program works as expected for all potential cases.
