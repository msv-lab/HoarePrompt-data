Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input string and the remembered substring correctly.
2. It generates all possible numbers by permutating the remaining characters in the input string after removing the remembered substring.
3. It then checks if the remembered substring is present in the generated number and if the length of the number is correct.
4. Finally, it returns the smallest number that satisfies the conditions.
5. The program uses permutations to generate all possible numbers and checks for the smallest one, which ensures that the output is the smallest possible initial integer n.
