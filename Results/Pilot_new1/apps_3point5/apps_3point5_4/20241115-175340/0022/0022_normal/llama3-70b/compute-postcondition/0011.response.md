Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is between 0 and n // 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This covers all possible scenarios where the palindrome property is violated.***
