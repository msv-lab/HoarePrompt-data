Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts a string input. Since the precondition specifies that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters, the output state is `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters**
