Postcondition: ***s is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters. If the character at index i in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the program returns False. This condition covers all possible cases where the characters at symmetric positions in the string s are not equal, leading to the function returning False.***
