Output State: **If the length of string s is even, the loop will execute n/2 times. If the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of string s is odd, the loop will execute (n-1)/2 times, as the middle character will not be compared. If the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, the function returns False. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns True by default.**
