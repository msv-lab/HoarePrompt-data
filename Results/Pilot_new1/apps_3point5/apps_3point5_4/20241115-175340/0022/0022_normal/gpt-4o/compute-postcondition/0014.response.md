The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. 

The functionality of the function `func_1` is as follows:
- If the length of string `s` is even, the loop will execute n/2 times. If the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, the function returns False.
- If the length of string `s` is odd, the loop will execute (n-1)/2 times, as the middle character will not be compared. If the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, the function returns False.
- If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns True by default.
- The program returns True in Case_2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It compares symmetric positions in the string and returns False if they are not equal. If the length of the string is less than 2, it returns True by default.**
