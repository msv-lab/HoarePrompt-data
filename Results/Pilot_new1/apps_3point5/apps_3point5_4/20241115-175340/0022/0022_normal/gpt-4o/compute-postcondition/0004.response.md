Postcondition: ***s is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters, n is the length of string s and n is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index i in string s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, then the function returns False. This covers all possible cases where the characters at symmetric positions in the string are not equal, resulting in the function returning False.***
