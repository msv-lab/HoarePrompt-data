According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. The loop will iterate n // 2 times, so n must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, is_spalindrome is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `is_spalindrome` is True.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True**
