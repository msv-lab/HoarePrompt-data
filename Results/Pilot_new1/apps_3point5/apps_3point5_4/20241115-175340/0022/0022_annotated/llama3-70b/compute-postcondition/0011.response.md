Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. `i` is less than (n // 2) + 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This handles all cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not the same in the string `s`.***
