Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It then iterates through the string to check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). If the characters at symmetric positions do not match, it returns False. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True. The function handles cases where the length of the string is less than 2 correctly by not executing the loop. **
