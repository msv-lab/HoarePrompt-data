Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, containing only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, `is_spalindrome` remains True.***
