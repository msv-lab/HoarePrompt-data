The function reads a string `s` from the user input, calculates its length `n`, and determines if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If the characters do not match, it sets `is_spalindrome` to False. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. The function operates on a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000, containing only English letters.
