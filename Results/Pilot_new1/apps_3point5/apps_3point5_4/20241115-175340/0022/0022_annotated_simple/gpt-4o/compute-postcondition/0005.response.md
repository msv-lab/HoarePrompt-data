According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, and `n` is the length of the string `s` which is at least 2. If the condition `s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]` is met, the function will return False. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`. Since the loop is iterating over the first half of the string, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2**
