The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. If the length of the string `s` is at least 2, the function checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal. If any pair of characters at symmetric positions are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If all characters at symmetric positions are equal, the function returns True.
