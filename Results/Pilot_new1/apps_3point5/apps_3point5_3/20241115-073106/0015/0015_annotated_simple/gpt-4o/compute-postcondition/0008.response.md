Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'YES' to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this code, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. `b` is not equal to `a`. `c` is not equal to 0. The difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer**
