Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, then 'NO' is printed. The program handles cases where the result of (b - a) is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, printing 'YES'. It also accounts for cases where the condition is not met, leading to 'NO' being printed. The postcondition ensures that all possible scenarios are covered, including edge cases where `c` is 0 or the division result is negative.***
