Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If b is equal to a, the program correctly prints 'YES' as the favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence.
2. If c is equal to 0, the program correctly prints 'NO' as the sequence would not contain Vasya's favorite number.
3. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program correctly prints 'YES' as it checks if Vasya's favorite number can be reached from the first element of the sequence with the given difference between neighboring elements.
4. In all other cases, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
