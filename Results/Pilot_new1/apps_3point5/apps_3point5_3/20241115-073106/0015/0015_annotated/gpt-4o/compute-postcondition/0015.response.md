Functionality: ** The function takes three integer inputs a, b, and c within the range -10^9 to 10^9. It checks if b equals a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The function essentially determines relationships between the input integers a, b, and c and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.**
