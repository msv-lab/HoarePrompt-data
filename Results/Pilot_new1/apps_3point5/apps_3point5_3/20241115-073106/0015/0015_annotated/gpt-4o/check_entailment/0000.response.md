Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence generated starting from a with a common difference of c. It handles the cases where b is equal to a, where c is equal to 0, and where the relationship between a, b, and c allows b to appear in the sequence. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program's logic, which aligns with the problem description. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified.
