Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, printing 'YES' in that case, 'NO' otherwise. The function covers scenarios where `c` is 0, the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result is non-negative. However, the function lacks a return value.**
