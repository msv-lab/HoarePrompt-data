Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values based on the input. `c` is equal to 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, the string 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the string 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the execution of the if-else block.***
