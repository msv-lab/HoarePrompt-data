Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split operation. `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `c` is not equal to 0, including when the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of dividing `b` minus `a` by `c` is greater than or equal to 0, as well as cases where these conditions are not met.***
