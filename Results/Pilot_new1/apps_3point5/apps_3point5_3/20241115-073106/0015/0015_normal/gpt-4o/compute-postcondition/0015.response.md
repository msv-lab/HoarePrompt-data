Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers from the input, compares them, and prints 'YES' if the second integer is equal to the first, 'NO' if the third integer is 0, 'YES' if the difference between the second and first integer is divisible by the third integer and the result of the division is non-negative, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
