Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The function uses a helper function `count` to calculate the count of numbers that meet the criteria. The implementation of the `count` function seems to correctly handle the cases based on the problem description. The main function then calculates the final result by subtracting the count for `l-1` from the count for `r` and takes the result modulo `998244353`.

The input is correctly read using `map(int, input().split())` and the result is printed after calling the `func_1` function with the input values.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases within the given constraints.
