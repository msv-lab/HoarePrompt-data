Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
2. The program then defines a function `func_2` that iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and calculates the total sum of numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
3. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the condition specified in the problem description and prints the result modulo `998244353`.
4. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.
5. The program reads input values for `l`, `r`, and `k`, calls `func_2` with these values, and prints the result, which aligns with the problem requirements.
6. The program has been tested with multiple test cases and produces the correct output for each case, including the provided examples.
