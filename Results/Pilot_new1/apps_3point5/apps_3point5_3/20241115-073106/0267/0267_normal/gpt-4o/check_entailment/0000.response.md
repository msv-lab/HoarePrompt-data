Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of two functions. 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`, which aligns with the problem description.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) iterates over the range `[l, r]` and calls `func_1(num, k)` for each number in that range. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True for any number, the total sum is updated correctly.
- The code handles the case where `l` is greater than `r` by not executing the loop and keeping the total sum as 0.
- The output hints also align with the code, explaining the functionality of each function accurately.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle correctly.
