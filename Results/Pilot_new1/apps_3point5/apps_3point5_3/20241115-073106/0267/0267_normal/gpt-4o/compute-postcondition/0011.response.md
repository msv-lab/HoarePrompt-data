According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `(num + 1)` are integers. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `(num + 1)` are integers where `num` is incremented by 1**
