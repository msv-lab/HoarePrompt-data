According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD. In all cases, `l`, `r`, and `num + 1` remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to `(num + 1)` and `l` and `r` need to remain the same.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `(num + 1)` are integers**
