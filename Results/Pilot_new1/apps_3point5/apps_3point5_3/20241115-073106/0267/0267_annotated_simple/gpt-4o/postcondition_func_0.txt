The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10. The function returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it returns False. The code accurately checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k` and returns True or False accordingly.
