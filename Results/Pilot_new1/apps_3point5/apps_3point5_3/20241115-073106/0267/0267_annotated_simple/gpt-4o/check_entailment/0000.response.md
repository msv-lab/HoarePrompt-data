Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, where func_1 checks if the number of unique digits in an integer is less than or equal to a given value k, and func_2 calculates the sum of numbers within a given range that satisfy the condition of func_1.
2. The logic of func_1 seems correct as it checks the uniqueness of digits in a number and returns True if the condition is satisfied.
3. In func_2, the total sum is calculated correctly by iterating through the range [l, r], checking each number if it satisfies the condition of func_1, and adding it to the total sum if it does. The sum is then returned modulo MOD as required.
4. The program seems to correctly implement the problem description and handles all potential cases within the given constraints.
