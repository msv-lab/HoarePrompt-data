Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r` remain unchanged, and `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved.***
