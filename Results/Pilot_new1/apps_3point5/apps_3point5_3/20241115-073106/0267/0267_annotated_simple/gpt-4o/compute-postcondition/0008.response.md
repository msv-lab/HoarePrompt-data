According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r` remain unchanged, and `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num, k). The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` value should be considered. Since the loop iterates from `l` to `r` inclusive, the next `num` value should be `num + 1` within the range of `l` to `r`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r` remain unchanged, and `num + 1` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num + 1, k)`. The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved.**
