According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated with the calculated value. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The value of dp[n, k] is updated with the calculated value, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**
