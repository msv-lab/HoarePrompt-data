The function func_1 accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k and calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD. It relies on the count function to compute the difference between the counts of certain values. However, the implementation of the count function is missing, so the overall functionality is incomplete without the details of count function logic.
