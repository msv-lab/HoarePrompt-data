According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `k`. Additionally, the pair (n, k) with a value of 9 should not be present in dp, so the updated value of dp[n, k] should not be 9. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9, i is less than k, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
