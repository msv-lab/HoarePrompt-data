Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The variables `n` and `k` are used in the calculation, but their initial values are not provided. It is only mentioned that `dp` does not contain the pair `(n, k)` with a value of 9. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9**
