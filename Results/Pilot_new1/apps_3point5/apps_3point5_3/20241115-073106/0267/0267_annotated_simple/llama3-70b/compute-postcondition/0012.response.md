According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9, i is equal to k**
