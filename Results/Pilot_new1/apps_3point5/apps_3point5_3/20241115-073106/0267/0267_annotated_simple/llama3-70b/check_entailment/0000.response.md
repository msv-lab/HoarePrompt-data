Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `count`, to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits modulo `998244353`.
- The `count` function handles the calculation of the count based on the constraints provided in the problem description.
- The `func_1` function calculates the final result by subtracting the count for `l-1` from the count for `r`.
- The program uses memoization to store previously calculated values and optimize the computation.
- The logic and calculations in the functions are based on the problem description and constraints, ensuring that the program meets the requirements for all potential cases within the specified input range.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
