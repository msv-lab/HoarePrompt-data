The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function returns the updated value of total_sum after iterating over the range from `l` to `r` based on the evaluation of func_1(num, k). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, iterate over the range from `l` to `r`, evaluate func_1(num, k) for each number in the range, and return the updated value of total_sum.
