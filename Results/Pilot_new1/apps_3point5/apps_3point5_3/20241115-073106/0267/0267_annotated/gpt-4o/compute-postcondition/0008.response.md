According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition of `func_1(num, k)` for the next value after `l` within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows: `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`. If such a value exists, `total_sum` will be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD` and `num` will be updated to this next value. If no such value exists, no changes are made to the variables.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k`**
