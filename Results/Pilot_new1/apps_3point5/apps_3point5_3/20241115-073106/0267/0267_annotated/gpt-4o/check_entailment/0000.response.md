Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to check if a number has at most `k` different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` satisfying this condition.
2. `func_1` correctly determines if the number of unique digits in an integer is less than or equal to `k`.
3. `func_2` iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive, and for each number in the range, it checks if it satisfies the condition using `func_1` and updates the total sum accordingly.
4. The program calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, as described in the problem statement.
5. The output is the sum of these numbers modulo `998244353`.
6. The code annotations provide examples that align with the problem description, and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not covered by the code.
7. All provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
8. Therefore, based on the code, the annotations, and the problem description, the program can be considered correct.
