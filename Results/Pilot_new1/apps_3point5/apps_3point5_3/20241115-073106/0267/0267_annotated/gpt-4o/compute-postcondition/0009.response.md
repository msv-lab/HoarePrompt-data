Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values are `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and `k`. After execution, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k`**
