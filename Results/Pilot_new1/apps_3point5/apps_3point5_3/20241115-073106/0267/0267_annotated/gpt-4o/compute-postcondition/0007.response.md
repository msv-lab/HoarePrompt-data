Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `func_1(num, k)` is false, no changes are made to the variables.***
