Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is present in dp, the program returns the value stored at that key. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the given formula for each iteration of the loop, and i ranges from 1 to k-1. The final value of dp[n, k] is calculated by the formula involving n, k, and MOD.***
