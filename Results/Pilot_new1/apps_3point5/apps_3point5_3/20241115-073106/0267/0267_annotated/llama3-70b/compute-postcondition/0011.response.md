Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation. The values of `n` and `k` are not provided, but `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula given. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula, i is 1.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula, i is 1**
