Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and compares it with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. If `s` contains all characters of the target string in order, it prints the target string. If `s` does not contain all characters of the target string in order, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
