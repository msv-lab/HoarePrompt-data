Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the alphabet and for each character, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces it with the next character in the input string. After iterating through all the characters in the alphabet, if the length of `res` is 26 (indicating all characters have been found), it prints `res`, otherwise, it prints -1. This logic ensures that the output string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program covers all possible cases and correctly handles the problem description.
