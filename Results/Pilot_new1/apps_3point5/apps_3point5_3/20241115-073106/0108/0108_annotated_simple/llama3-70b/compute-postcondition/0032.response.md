Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the value of `char` to it. The value of `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`. Therefore, `res` is updated with the modified value of the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`, `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`**
