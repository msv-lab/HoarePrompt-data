According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the alphabet. Since the alphabet is not explicitly defined, we can assume it refers to the lowercase English alphabet. Therefore, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, and `res` is an empty string. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `char` to be the first lowercase English letter.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first lowercase English letter**
