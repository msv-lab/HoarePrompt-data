Example Answer:
The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The value of `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`, `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of `char`, `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`**
