Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`, which means the next lowercase English letter is added to the first lowercase English letter. The ASCII sequence ensures that the next lowercase English letter is added. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
