Example Answer:
The `char` is replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, and only the first occurrence is replaced. Therefore, the `s` will be updated accordingly. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, `res` is updated based on the addition of `char**.
