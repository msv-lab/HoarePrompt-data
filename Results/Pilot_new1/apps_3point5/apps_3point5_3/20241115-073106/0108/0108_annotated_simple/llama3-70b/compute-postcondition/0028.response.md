According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of `char`**
