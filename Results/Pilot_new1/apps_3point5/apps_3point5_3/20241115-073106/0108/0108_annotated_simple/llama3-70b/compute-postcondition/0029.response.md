Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the value of `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but after execution, it will have the value of the previous `res` plus the value of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of `char`**
