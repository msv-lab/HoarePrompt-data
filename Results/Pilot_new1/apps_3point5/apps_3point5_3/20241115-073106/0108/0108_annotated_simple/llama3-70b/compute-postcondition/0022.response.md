Example Answer:
The `char` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, with only the first occurrence being replaced in the string `s`. The `s` and `res` variables are updated based on this replacement. 
Output State: **`s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence**
