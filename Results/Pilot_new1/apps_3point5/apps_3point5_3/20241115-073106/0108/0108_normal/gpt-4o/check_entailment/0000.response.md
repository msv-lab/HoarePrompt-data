Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` from the user input and iterates through it.
- It compares each character of `s` with the characters in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- If `s` contains all characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- Otherwise, it prints -1.
- The code handles edge cases such as an empty string or characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' not in order by printing -1.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
