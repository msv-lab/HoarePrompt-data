According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`. Otherwise, `j` remains less than 26. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s`.
- `j` needs to be less than 26.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`. Otherwise, `j` remains less than 26**
