Example Answer: 
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character that is one position ahead in the ASCII table. The replacement is done only once. Since the initial state mentions that `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, `s` is not empty, and `res` has been appended with an unknown character, we can infer that `s` contains all alphabet characters, and `res` has been appended with a character. After the execution of the code, `s` will have the character `char` replaced with the next character in the ASCII table, and `res` will still have an unknown character appended.
Output State: **`s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string with one character replaced with the next ASCII character, `res` has been appended with an unknown character**
