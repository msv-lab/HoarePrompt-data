The function `func` reads a string `s` from user input and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If `s` contains all characters in the alphabet, it prints the resulting string `res`. If the length of `res` is 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters.
