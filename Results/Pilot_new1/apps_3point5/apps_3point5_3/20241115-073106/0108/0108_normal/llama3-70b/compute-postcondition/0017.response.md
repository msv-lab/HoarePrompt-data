According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string. This means that the loop can execute again as long as `char` is in `s`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty.**
