Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, `s` is an empty string, `res` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string in order, and `char` is the character after the last character in the `alphabet` string, then the `res` string is printed. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, `res` contains the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced character in `s`. If `s` is empty or does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, the loop does not execute, and `s`, `res`, and `char` remain unchanged. If the length of `res` is 26, the `res` string is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
