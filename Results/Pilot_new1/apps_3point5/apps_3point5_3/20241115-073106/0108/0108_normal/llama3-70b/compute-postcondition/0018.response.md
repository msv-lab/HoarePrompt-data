Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` string. The previous value of `res` is unknown, and the value of `char` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty, and `res` has been appended with an unknown character.
Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty, and `res` has been appended with an unknown character**
