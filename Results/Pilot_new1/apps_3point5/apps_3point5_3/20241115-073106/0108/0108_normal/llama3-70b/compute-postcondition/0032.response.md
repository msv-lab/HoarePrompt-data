Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to the end of `res`. The previous value of `res` contains the replaced characters, and the value of `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated based on the replacement, `res` contains the replaced characters along with the new character from `char`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is updated based on the replacement, `res` contains the replaced characters along with the new character from `char`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string**
