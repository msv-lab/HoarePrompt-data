Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, then after the loop finishes, `s` is updated based on the replacements, `res` contains all the replaced characters along with the new characters from `char`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string. If `char` is not in `s`, then `s`, `res`, and `char` remain unchanged. If `s` is empty or does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, the loop does not execute.**
