The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the consecutive character until that character is no longer present in `s`. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input string `s`.
