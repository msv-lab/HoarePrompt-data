Example Answer:
The character 'a' in string `s` is replaced by the character 'b' once, and the character 'b' in string `s` is replaced back to 'a'. The variable `res` contains the characters 'aaa', and the variable `char` is 'a'. After execution, the value of `s` will depend on the initial value of `s`, and the value of `res` will remain 'aaa', and the value of `char` will remain 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once and 'b' replaced back to 'a', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
