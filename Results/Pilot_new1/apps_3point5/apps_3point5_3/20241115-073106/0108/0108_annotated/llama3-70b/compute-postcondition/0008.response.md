Example Answer: 
The character 'a' in string `s` is replaced by the character that comes after 'a' in the ASCII table, which is 'b', but only once. Therefore, after execution, `s` will have 'b' instead of the first occurrence of 'a'. The other variables `res` and `char` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once, `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
