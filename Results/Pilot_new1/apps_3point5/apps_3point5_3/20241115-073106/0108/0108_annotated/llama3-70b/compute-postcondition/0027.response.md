Example Answer:
The character 'char' is replaced with the character following it in 's' only once. The 'char' variable is updated to the character following the last character replaced. The 'res' variable contains the characters added in each iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'.
Output State: **If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
