Postcondition: ***If 'a' is in 's', then 'res' will contain all occurrences of 'a' in 's' replaced with consecutive characters until 'a' is no longer in 's'. The final value of 'char' will be the character following the last character replaced in 's'. If 'a' is not in 's', then 'res' is an empty string. If 'a' is not in 'alphabet' or 's' is an empty string, the loop does not execute and 's', 'res', and 'char' remain unchanged. Additionally, the length of 'res' is equal to 26***
