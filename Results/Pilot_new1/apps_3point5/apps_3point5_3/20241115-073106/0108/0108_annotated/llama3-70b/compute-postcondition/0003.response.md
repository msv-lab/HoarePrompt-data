According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the alphabet contains characters. Since the alphabet is not explicitly defined, we can assume it refers to the English alphabet. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the alphabet must contain at least one character. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, and `res` is an empty string. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to set `char` to be the first character in the English alphabet.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
