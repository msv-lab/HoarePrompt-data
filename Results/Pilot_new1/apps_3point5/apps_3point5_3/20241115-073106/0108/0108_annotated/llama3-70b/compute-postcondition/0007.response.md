Example Answer: 
The string `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, where `char` is 'a' and `res` contains the character 'a'. After execution, the string `res` will now contain 'aa'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once, `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once, `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
