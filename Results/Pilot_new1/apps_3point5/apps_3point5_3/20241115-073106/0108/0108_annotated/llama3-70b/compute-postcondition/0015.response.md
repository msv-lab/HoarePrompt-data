Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are known, so the new value of `res` would be the concatenation of the old `res` value and the `char` value. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'.
Output State: **'s' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
