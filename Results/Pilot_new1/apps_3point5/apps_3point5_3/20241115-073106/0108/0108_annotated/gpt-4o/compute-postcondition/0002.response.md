Example Answer:
The variable `target_len` is assigned the length of the string `target`, which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Since the length of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is 26, the value of `target_len` is 26. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; target_len is 26.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; target_len is 26**
