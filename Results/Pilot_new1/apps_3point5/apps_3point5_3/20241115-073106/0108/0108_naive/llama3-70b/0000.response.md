Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through the alphabet characters and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence. The program then checks if the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the alphabet) and prints the result or -1 accordingly. The logic of the program is sound and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
