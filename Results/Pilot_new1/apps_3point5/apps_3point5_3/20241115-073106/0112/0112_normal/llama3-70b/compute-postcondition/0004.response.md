Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube in the list 'cubes' and converts it to a string before adding it to the set 'digits'. Since 'cube' is the first cube in the list 'cubes', the set 'digits' will be updated with the string representation of each digit in the first cube. The initial state is: n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list. After execution, the set 'digits' will contain the string representation of each digit in the first cube.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
