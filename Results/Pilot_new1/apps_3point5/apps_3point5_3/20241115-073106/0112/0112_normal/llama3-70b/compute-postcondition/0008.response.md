Example Answer: 
The code updates the set `digits` with the string representation of each digit in the first cube. Since `digits` is a set, duplicate values will not be added. The initial state includes `n` as an input integer, `cubes` as a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, and `digits` as a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube. After running the code, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representation of each digit in the first cube.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
