Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts all digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a single integer, and prints the resulting maximum number. The function does not return any value.**
