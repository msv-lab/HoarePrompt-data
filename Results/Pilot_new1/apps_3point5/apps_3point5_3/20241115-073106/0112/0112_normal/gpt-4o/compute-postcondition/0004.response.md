According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` is a positive integer
- `digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`
- `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`
- `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list
- `found` is False

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts would be:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False**
