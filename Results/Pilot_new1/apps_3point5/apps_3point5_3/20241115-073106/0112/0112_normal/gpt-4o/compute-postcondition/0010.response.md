According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `used_cubes` list. If `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`**
