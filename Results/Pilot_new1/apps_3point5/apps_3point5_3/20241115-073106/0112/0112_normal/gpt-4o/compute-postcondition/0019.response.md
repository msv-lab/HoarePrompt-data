Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, `i+1` is less than the length of `used_cubes`. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is terminated. All other variables retain their initial values.***
