According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more digits in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is False, and index of the next digit in `digits` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the index of the next digit in `digits` needs to be less than the length of the `digits` list.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is False, index of the next digit in `digits` is incremented by 2**
