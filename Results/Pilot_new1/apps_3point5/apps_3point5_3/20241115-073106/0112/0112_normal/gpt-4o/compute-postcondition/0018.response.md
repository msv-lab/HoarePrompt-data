Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i+1` is less than the length of `used_cubes`**
