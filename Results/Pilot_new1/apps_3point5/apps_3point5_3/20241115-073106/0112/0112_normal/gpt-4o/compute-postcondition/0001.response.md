Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, each initialized to `False`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact length of the list cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False**`.
