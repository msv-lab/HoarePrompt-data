According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop can execute. Since `digits` is an empty set before the loop starts, it needs to be adjusted so that `cubes` has at least 1 cube. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `cube` should be the first cube in the list.
State: **`digits` is an empty set, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
