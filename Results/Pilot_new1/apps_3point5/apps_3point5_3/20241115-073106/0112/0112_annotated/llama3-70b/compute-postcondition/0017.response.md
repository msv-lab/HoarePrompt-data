Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts the individual digits from all cubes, removes '0' if it exists, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a number, and prints the maximum number that can be formed. If '0' is present in any cube, it is removed before finding the maximum number.**
