Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa using cube rotations. However, the code does not handle this constraint. For example, if the cubes have both 6 and 9 on them, Masha would not be able to form numbers correctly following the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
