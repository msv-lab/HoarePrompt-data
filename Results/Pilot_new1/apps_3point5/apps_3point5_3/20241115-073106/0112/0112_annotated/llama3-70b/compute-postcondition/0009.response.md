According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If there are at least 4 cubes in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `cube` is the third cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes and `cube` should be the fourth cube in the list.
State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all three cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, `cube` is the fourth cube in the list**
