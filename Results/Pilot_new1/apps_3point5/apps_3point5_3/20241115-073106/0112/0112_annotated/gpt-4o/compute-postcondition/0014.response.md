Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i+1` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
