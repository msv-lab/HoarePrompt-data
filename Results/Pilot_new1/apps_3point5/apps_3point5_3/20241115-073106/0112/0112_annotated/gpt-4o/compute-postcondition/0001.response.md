Example Answer:
Each element in the list `used_cubes` is assigned the value `False`, and the length of the list is `n`. Therefore, after execution, the list `used_cubes` will contain `n` elements, all initialized to `False`.
Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `False`**
