According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, and `found` is False. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
