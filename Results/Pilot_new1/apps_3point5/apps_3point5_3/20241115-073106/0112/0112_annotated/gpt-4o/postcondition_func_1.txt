The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces` meeting specific constraints. It iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if each digit can be formed by the faces of the cubes represented in `cube_faces`. If a digit cannot be formed by any cube face, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, the function returns True. The function has a precondition that `num` is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 <= n <= 3, and each inner list in `cube_faces` contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, ranging from 0 to 9 (inclusive).
