Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input of the number of cubes and the digits on each face of the cubes. It then extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and constructs the maximum number possible. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description as it finds the maximum number that can be formed using the given cubes without violating the rules specified. Additionally, the program considers all possible cases and correctly handles them to output the desired result.
