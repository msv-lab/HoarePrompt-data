Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`. After the execution of the if statement, all elements in the list `used_cubes` remain `False` except for the element `i` which becomes `True` if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True` if the condition is met. The variable `n` remains greater than 0.***
