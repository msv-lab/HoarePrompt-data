Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` as a parameter. It iterates through the list of cube faces and checks if a specific condition is met during the loop execution. If the condition is met at least once, the function returns True. If the condition is not met at all, the function returns False. However, the code does not handle cases where the input `num` is negative or zero, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, if the list `cube_faces` is empty, the loop will not execute, potentially causing the function to always return False.**
