According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the list `digits` must have at least 1 digit for the loop to execute. Additionally, `digit` being the first digit in the list is necessary for the loop to run properly. The variable `found` being `False` does not directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to: 
State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0**
