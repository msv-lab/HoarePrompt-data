According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`, except for the element `i` which becomes `True` if a certain condition is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit and `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True` if the condition is met, and `n` remains greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the range.
- If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied for the new value of `i`, then the corresponding element in `used_cubes` should be set to `True`.
- No changes need to be made to `digits`, `digit`, `found`, or `n`.

State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`, except for the element `i+1` which becomes `True` if the condition is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True` if the condition is met. The variable `n` remains greater than 0.**
