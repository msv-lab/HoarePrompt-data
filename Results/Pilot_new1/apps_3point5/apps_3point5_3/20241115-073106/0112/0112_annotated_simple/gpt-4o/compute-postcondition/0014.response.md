Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`, except for the element `i+1` which becomes `True` if the condition is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True` if the condition is met. The variable `n` remains greater than 0. After the execution of the if statement, if `used_cubes[i]` is `False` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the loop or if statement is exited. This ensures that the state of the program variables is consistent with the initial conditions, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
