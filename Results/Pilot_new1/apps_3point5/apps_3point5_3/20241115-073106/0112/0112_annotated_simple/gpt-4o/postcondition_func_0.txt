The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube. Each integer a_{i}_{j} is such that 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. The function returns the smallest integer x such that can_form_number(x) is false, or 0 if n is 0. If n is greater than 3, the function does not handle this case explicitly. Additionally, the function does not provide any information on what can_form_number(x) does or how it is defined.
