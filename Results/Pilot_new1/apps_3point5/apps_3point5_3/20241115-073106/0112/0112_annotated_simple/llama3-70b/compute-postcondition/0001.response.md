Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list of lists named `cubes` by taking input for `n` number of times and splitting the input into integers. Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, the number of lists inside `cubes` will be 1, 2, or 3 respectively. Each list will contain integers based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers based on the input**
