According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the digits set is empty. So for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being iterated over is the first cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
