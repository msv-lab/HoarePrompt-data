Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4 respectively. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4**
