The function `func` prompts the user for three positive integers a, b, and c. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. After that, it computes the total number of fruits by summing the products of the maximum lemons with 1, 2, and 4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. The function does not have any parameters as inputs.
