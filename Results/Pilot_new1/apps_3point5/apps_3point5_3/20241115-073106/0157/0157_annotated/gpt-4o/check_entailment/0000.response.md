Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum ratio between the three inputs, but it does not consider the fact that for each lemon, there should be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears in the compote. The code simply multiplies the maximum lemons by 1, 2, and 4 to get the total number of fruits, which is not in line with the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears.

An example where the code does not work correctly:
Input:
2
3
2

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output:
6

In this case, the code incorrectly calculates that Nikolay can use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears, resulting in a total of 14 fruits, which is not correct according to the problem description. The code should be modified to ensure that the fruits are in the correct ratio before calculating the total number of fruits.
