Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func` calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the input values of lemons, apples, and pears. It then computes the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can cook the compote from, following the ratio of 1:2:4. The code correctly handles cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote, in which case it returns 0. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code, further confirming its correctness.
