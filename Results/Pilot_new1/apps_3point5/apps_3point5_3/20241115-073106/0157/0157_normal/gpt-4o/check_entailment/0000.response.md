Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the quantities of apples and pears he has. It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote and prints the result. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly handles the ratios of lemons, apples, and pears specified in the problem. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
