Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
