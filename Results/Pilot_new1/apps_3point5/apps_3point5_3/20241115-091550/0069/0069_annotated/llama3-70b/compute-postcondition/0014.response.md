Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n and x are assigned values based on the input, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then -1 is printed. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0), then ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This encompasses all possible outcomes of the if else block, considering various edge cases and boundary values.***
