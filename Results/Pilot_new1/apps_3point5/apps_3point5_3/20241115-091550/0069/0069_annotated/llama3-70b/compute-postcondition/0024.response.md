Postcondition: ***T-1 is a positive integer, n and x are assigned values based on the input, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in string s respectively, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) based on the input values of n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, and balance. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
