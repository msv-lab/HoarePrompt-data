Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element. If the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
