Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1] with index increased by 3. The initial state of index is unknown, so the exact value of x cannot be determined. The conditions for updating prefix_balances and appending values to the results list are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1**
