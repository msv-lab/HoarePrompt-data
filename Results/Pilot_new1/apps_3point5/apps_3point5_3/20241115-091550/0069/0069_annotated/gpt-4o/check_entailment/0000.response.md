Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that if the balance of the prefix is 0 and the desired balance is in the list of prefix balances, then -1 should be appended to the results. However, according to the problem description, if there is an infinite number of such prefixes, then -1 should be printed for that test case. The code does not handle the case of an infinite number of prefixes correctly.

For example, in the test case:
```
1
1 0
0
```
The code should output -1 because there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance 0, but the code will output 0 instead.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the case of an infinite number of prefixes as specified in the problem description.
