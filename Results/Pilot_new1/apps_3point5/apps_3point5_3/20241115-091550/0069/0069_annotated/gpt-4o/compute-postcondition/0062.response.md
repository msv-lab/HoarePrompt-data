Postcondition: ***T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, x is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], index is increased by 3, balance is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string s. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the prefix_balances list remains a list of zeros. If x is in prefix_balances, then -1 is appended to the results list. If x is not in prefix_balances, then 0 is appended to the results list.***
