According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` remains greater than 0, `n` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `s` is assigned a valid value from `data`, `balance` is calculated based on '0's and '1's in `s`, `index` is defined, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
