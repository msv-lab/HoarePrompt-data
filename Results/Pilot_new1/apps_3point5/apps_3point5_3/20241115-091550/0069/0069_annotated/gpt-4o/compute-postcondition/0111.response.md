Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `T` remains greater than 0, `s` is assigned a valid value from `data`, `balance` is calculated based on '0's and '1's in `s`, `index` is defined, `i` is the current iteration count, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `prefix_balances` has at least one more element. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
