Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The previous values of `data`, `index`, and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`**
