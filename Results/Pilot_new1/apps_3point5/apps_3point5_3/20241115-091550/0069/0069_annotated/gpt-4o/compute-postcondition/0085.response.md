Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and filled with zeros. The variables `T`, `n`, `s`, `balance`, `data`, and `index` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`.
Output State: **T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`**
