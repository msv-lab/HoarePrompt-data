According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 results, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 results, and the `result` should be the second result in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list**
