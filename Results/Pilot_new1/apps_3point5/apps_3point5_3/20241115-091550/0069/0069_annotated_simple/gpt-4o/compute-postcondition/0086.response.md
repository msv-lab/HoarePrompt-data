According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, so for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1.
State: **`balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
