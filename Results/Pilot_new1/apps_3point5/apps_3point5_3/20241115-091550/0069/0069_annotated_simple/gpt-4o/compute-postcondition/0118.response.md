According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, and `results` is a list of results. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `results` list must have at least 1 result, and `result` is the first result in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list**
