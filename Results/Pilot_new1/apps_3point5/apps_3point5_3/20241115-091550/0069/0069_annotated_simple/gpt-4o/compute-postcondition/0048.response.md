Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and filled with zeros. The variables `n`, `x`, `s`, `index`, and `balance` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`**
