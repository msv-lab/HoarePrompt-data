Output State: **The loop updates the `prefix_balances` list by calculating the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to the index `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1.**
