Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop has executed and calculated the prefix balances based on the values in the string s. The prefix_balances array has been updated with each iteration. If n is less than 1, the loop did not execute. In addition, if the balance is 0, the results array appends -1 if x is in the prefix_balances array; otherwise, it appends 0. If the balance is not 0, count is incremented based on the conditions met during iteration and appended to the results array. The overall state of the program after the if else block has executed covers all edge cases, ensuring the correct handling of different scenarios.***
