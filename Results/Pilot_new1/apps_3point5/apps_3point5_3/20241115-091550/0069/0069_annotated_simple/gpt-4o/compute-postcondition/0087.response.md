Example Answer:
`prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. This updates the balance at index `i` based on the previous balance at index `i-1` and whether the character at index `i-1` in string `s` is '0' or not. The initial state mentions that `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, so the calculation depends on the specific values of `s`, `n`, and `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the updated `prefix_balances[i]` value based on the condition.
Output State: **`balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition**
