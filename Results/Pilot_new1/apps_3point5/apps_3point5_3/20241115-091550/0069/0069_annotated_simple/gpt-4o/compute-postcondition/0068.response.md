Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1 and prefix_balances array is non-empty, the values of x, b, and balance are such that ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), then count is incremented by 1. This condition covers all possible scenarios where the if statement is executed, ensuring that the count is increased under the specified conditions.***
