Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where the number of prefixes is finite and prints the correct values, as well as the case where the number of prefixes is infinite and prints -1. The logic for calculating the prefixes based on the balance and string length is implemented correctly. The program also correctly reads input for multiple test cases and processes them accordingly.
