Postcondition: ***T is the previous value + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance are all input values with specific characteristics. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. The postcondition ensures that all variables maintain their initial conditions and covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases related to the division and modulo operations.***
