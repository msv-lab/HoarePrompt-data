Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is a string, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the code prints n + 1. If the difference between x and balance is divisible by the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, the code prints -1. Otherwise, if the difference between x and balance is not divisible by the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, the code prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
