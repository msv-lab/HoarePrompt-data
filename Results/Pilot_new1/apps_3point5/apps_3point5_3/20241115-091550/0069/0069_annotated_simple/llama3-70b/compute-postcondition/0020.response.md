Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(n + 1)` prints the value of `n + 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the input integer incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is the previous value + 1, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' characters in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, and the program prints the input integer incremented by 1.
Output State: **T is the previous value + 1, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' characters in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, and the program prints the input integer incremented by 1**
