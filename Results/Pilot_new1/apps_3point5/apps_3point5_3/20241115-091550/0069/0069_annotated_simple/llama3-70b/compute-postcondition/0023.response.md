Postcondition: ***T is the previous value + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance are all input values with specific characteristics. If the result of (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. The postcondition covers all cases where the program variables maintain their initial conditions and the if-else block correctly handles the division and modulo operations, ensuring the program executes as intended.***
