Example Answer:
`balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s` and `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in `s`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in `s`**
