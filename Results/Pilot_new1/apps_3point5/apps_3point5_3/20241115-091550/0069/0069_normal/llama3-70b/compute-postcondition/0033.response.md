Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer incremented by 1, n and x are input integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in s, n and x are assigned the input integers, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in s respectively, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in s. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This covers all cases where the program executes based on the conditions provided.***
