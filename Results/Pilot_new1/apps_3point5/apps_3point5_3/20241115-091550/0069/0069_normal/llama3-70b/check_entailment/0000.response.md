Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases `T`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.
- It calculates the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, then computes the balance by subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's.
- Depending on the relationship between the balance and `x`, the code outputs different values as described in the problem statement.
- The code correctly handles cases where the balance is equal to `x`, where the remainder of the division between `(x - balance)` and `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is 0, and where the remainder is not 0.
- The code also considers the case where there might be an infinite number of prefixes and outputs -1 accordingly.
- The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correctly implemented to solve the given problem.
