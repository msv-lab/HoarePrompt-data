Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in `s`. The balance is not equal to x. The result of ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0***
