According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is equal to `n + 2` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, index is incremented by 7, results contains either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances, x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 1], balance is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string s, prefix_balances contains updated values, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n + 2, n is assigned the integer value of data[index + 3], x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 4], s is assigned the string value of data[index + 5], prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, n is assigned the integer value of data[index], x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 1], s is assigned the string value of data[index + 2], balance is calculated as s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, n is greater than 0, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the formula provided**
