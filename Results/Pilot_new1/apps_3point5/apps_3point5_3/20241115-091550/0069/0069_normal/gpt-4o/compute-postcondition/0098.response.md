Example Answer:
A value of 0 is appended to the list `results`. The list `results` now contains 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If balance is not 0, prefix_balances will be a list containing x along with the previous elements; `results` contains 0.
Output State: **If balance is not 0, prefix_balances will be a list containing x along with the previous elements; `results` contains 0**
