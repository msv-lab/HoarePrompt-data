Postcondition: ***count is an integer, prefix_balances is a list with at least 1 element, b is the first element in the prefix_balances list. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, count is increased by 1. This condition covers the case where the difference between x and b is divisible by balance, and the result of dividing the difference by balance is greater than or equal to 0.***
