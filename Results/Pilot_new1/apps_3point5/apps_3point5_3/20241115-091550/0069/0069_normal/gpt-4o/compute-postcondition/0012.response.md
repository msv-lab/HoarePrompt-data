According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1**
