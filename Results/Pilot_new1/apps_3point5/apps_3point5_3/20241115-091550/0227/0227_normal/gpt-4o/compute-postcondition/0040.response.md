According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the set assigned that have not been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, the element x was processed, a[i] - x is not in assigned. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element x in the set assigned that has not been processed yet needs to be determined. 
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order within the range [1, 10^9], assigned is a set containing elements from list a, element at index i, m is either 2 or 3, i is incremented by 1, assigned has at least 1 element, i is less than n, x is the next element in the set assigned that has not been processed yet, a[i] - x is not in assigned**
