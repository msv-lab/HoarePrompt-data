The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers where each element is within the range [1, 10^9]. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times `can_form` was False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the number of times `can_form` was False.
