Output State: **If `assigned` is not empty and there is no element in `assigned` that satisfies the condition `a[i] - x`, where `x` is an element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is False. In this case, `m` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False.**
