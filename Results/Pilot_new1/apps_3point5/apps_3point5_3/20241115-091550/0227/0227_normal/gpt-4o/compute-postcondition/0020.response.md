Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order within the range [1, 10^9], assigned is a set containing elements from list a, m is 1, i is 1. If there exists a pair of elements x and a[i] in assigned such that their difference is in assigned, can_form is set to True and the loop breaks. If no such pair exists, can_form remains False.**
