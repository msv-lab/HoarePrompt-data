Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, so the output state is: n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer increased by 1.
Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer increased by 1**
