Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer. If a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i - 1], then m is increased by 1. The postcondition covers the case where the condition inside the if statement is true, resulting in the increment of m, while also ensuring that the values of n, a, and m remain consistent with the initial state described in the precondition.***
