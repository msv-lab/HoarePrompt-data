According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1, and i is 1.
State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1, i is 1**
