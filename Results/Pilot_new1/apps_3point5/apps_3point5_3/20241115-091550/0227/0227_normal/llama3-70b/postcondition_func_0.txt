The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, sorts the list `a` in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to count how many elements are not twice the previous element. The function prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function assumes `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` contains distinct positive integers.
