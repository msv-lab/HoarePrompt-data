Correctness: False

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the code is incorrect and does not guarantee the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The code does not handle all potential cases where the sequence of operations cannot be performed with the given variables.

An example where the code fails:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

In this case, the code should output -1 as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations with the given values. However, the code will output 2 instead. This shows that the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
