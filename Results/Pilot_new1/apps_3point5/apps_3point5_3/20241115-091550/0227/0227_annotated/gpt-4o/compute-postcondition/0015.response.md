According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the set `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `assigned` contains the next element in list `a`, `x` is the next element in list `a`. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in list `a` should be added to the set `assigned`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9), `assigned` is a set containing the next two elements in list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next element in list `a`**
