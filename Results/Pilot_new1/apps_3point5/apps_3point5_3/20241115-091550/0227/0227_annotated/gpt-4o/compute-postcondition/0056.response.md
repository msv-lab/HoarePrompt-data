Postcondition: ***`assigned` has more than 1 element. If the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
