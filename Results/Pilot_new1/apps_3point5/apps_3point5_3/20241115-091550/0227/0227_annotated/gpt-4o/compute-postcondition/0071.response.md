Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It sorts the list 'a', then iterates through the list to determine the count of elements that cannot be formed as the difference of any two elements in the 'assigned' set. The function returns this count. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 1.**
