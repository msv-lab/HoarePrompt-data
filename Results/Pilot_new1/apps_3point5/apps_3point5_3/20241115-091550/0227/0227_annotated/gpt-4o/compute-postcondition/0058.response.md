Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The other variables and elements in the list `assigned` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` has more than 1 element and the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True.
Output State: **`assigned` has more than 1 element and the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True**
