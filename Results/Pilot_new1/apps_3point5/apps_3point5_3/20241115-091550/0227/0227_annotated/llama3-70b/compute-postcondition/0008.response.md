According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and m is 2. If the element at index i in the list a is not twice the element at index i-1, then m is increased by 1.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1, so `i` should be adjusted to `n-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 2, i is n-1**
