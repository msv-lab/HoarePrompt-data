Output State: *n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] * 2, then m is increased by 1. In all cases, m is either 2 or 3, and i ranges from n-1 to 1. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] * 2, then m is increased by 1. If n is 1, the loop does not execute and m remains 1.*
