According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1 does not impact the loop execution directly. For the loop to execute, the initial state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `m` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
