Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `can_form` is True. After the execution of the if statement, if there exists an element `a[i]` in `a` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
