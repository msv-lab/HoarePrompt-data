Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` along with the new element `a[i+1]`, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
