Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is set to `False`. The values of `assigned`, `m`, and `n` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False.
Output State: **`assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False**
