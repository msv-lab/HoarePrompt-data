The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers with a length of `n`. After executing the loop within the function, the program returns the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the value of `m` after the loop execution.
