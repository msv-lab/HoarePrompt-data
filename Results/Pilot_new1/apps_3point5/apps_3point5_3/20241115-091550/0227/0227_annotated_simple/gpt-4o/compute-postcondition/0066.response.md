Output State: **`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` along with the new element `a[i+2]`, `x` is the last element in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` is False. If there are no elements in the updated `assigned` or no element `a[i+1]` in `a` such that `a[i+1] - x` is in the updated `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False.**
