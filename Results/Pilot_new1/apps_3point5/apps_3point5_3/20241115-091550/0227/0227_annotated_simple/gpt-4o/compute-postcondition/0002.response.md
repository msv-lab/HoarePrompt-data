Example Answer: 
The code adds the first element of list `a` to the set `assigned`. Since the set was initially empty, the value of `a[0]` will be added to the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`.
Output State: **`assigned` contains the first element of list `a`**
