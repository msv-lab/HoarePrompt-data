Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` one by one, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False if the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is not in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False.***
