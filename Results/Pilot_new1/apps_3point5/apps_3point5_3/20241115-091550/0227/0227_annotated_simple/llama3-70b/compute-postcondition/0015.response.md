Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 24), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `m` is either 1 or 2. If the element at index i in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index i - 1, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being set to 2. If n is 1, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 1.**
