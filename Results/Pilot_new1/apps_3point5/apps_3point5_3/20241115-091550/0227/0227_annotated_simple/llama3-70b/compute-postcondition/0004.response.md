According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Since n is a positive integer, it satisfies the condition. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, which will not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to be 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
