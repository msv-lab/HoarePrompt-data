Example Answer:
`floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, where `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are unknown. Then `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor` depends on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, which are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: No change in the initial state.
Output State: **No change in the initial state**
