The function accepts an integer parameter `apartment`, calculates the block and floor numbers based on the apartment number, and returns the variables 'block' and 'floor'. The block number is determined by dividing the apartment number by the product of `m` and `k`, while the floor number within the block is calculated using modular arithmetic.
