Example Answer:
`min_block_time` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `a_block` and `b_block` and `n` minus the absolute difference of `a_block` and `b_block`, multiplied by 15. The values of `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated based on the given formulas. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, `b_floor` is calculated as ((b - 1) % m) + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_block_time` is assigned the calculated value.
