Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are known, so we can calculate `a_block` based on these values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula**
