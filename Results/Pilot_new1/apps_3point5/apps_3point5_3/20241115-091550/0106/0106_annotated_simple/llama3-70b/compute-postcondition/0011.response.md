Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers; `a`, `b` are assigned input integers; `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time` are calculated values. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is set to the absolute difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor` multiplied by 5 plus 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is set to the absolute difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor` multiplied by 5 plus 10. This calculation accounts for all possible scenarios based on the conditions in the program fragment.***
