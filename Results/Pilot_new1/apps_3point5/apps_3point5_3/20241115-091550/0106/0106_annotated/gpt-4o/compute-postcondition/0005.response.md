Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the block and floor numbers based on the given formula. The block number is determined by dividing the apartment number minus one by the product of `m` and `k`, then adding one. The floor within the block is calculated by finding the remainder of the apartment number minus one divided by the product of `m` and `k`. The floor number is then calculated by dividing the floor within the block by `k` and adding one. The function returns the block and floor numbers. **
