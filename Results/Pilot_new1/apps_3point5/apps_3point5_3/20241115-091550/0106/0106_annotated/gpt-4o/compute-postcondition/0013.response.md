The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k` are such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000, and the positive integers `a`, `b` are such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k. The function returns the total time calculated based on the given conditions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n, m, k, a, b satisfying the given constraints and returns the total time calculated based on the conditions.**
