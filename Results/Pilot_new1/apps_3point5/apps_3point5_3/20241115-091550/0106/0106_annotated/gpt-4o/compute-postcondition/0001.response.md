Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated by taking the remainder of `(apartment - 1)` divided by `(m * k)`. The variables `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are used in this calculation. After the execution of this code snippet, the value of `floor_within_block` is determined based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
