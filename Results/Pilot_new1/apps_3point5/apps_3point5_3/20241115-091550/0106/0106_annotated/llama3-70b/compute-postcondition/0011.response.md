Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a`, `b` are integers, `a_floor` is calculated as `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` and `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
