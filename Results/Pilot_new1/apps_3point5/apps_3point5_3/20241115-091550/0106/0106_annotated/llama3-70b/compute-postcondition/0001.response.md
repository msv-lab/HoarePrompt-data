Example Answer: 
`a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` splits the input by spaces and `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input, while the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split**
