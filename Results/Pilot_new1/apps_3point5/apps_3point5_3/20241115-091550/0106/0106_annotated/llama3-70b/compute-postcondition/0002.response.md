Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a` and `m` are known, so we can calculate `a_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula**
