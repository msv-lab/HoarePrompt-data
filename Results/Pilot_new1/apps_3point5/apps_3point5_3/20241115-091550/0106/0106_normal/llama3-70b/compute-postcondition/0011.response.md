Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are assigned the input integers. a_floor, a_block, b_floor, b_block, and min_block_time are calculated based on the input values. If a_floor is greater than b_floor, min_floor_time is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If a_floor is less than or equal to b_floor, min_floor_time is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.***
