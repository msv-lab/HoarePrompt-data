Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` is the input integer and `m` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The value of `b_floor` depends on the input values of `b` and `m`, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values; `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values; `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values**
