Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers. `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are calculated based on the input values. The value of `a_floor` is greater than the value of `b_floor`. `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
