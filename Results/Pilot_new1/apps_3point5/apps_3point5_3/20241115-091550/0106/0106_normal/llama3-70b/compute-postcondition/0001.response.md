Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. The values of `a` and `b` are within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b, `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b, `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers**
