Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated using the formula (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1. The values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are known, and `b_block` is assigned the calculated value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values; `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `b_block` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values; `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `b_block` is calculated based on the input values**
