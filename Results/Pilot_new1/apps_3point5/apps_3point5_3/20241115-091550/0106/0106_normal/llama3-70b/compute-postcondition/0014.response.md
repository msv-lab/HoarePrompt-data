Functionality: **The function reads input values for n, m, k, a, and b. It then calculates various values based on these inputs and prints the sum of min_block_time and min_floor_time. The calculation involves determining floor and block values for a and b, calculating the minimum time based on block differences, and calculating the minimum time based on floor differences.**
