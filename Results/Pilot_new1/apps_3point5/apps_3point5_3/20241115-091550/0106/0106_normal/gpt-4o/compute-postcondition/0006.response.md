Postcondition: ***`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `a`, `b` are determined based on the initial values. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is different from 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). The postcondition covers all possible scenarios based on the values of `floor_a` and `floor_b`, ensuring the correct calculation of `time_to_exit` in each case.***
