Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `get_location`, that work together to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided inputs.
- The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers based on the apartment number.
- The `func_1` function correctly determines the time for Edward to exit his current floor, calculates the walking time between blocks in both directions, and calculates the time to reach the target floor.
- The total time is correctly calculated as the sum of these individual times.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.
- The output hints also align with the code and describe the correct functionality of the functions.
- Therefore, based on the code, description, and output hints, the program appears to be correct.
