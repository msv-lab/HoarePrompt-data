Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b` are positive integers between 1 and n·m·k. The function calculates the total time required based on the locations of `a` and `b`, considering walking times and floor differences. The total time is the sum of the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. **
