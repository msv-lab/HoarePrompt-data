Output State: **Based on the values of `floor_a` and `floor_b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
