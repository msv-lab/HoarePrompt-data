Example Answer:
The variable `block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `block` is determined by dividing `(apartment - 1)` by `(m * k)` and adding 1 to it. The variables `m`, `n`, and `k` are positive integers with specific constraints. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **m, n, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.** `block` is calculated based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
