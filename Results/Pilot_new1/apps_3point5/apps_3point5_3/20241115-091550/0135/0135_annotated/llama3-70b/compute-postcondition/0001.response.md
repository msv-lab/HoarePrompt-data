Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen` is an empty set**
