Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1, the remainder will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
