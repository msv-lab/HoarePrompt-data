Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is updated to the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is present in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables and the program continues its execution.***
