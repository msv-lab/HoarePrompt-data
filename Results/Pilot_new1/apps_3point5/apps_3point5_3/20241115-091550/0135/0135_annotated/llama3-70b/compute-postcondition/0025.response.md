Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder repeats. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function assumes that `n` and `k` are positive integers. **
