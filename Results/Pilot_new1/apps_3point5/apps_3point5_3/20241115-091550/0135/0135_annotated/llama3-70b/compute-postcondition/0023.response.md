Output State: **If `k` is at least 1 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will iterate from 1 to `k` calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and adding it to the `seen` set. If at any point the calculated `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program will print 'No' and exit. If `k` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.**
