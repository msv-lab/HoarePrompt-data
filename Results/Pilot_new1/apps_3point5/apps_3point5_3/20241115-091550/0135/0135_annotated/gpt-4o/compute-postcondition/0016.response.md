The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. 

Case 2: If k is less than n, the function will iterate k times, adding the remainder of n divided by i to the set of seen remainders each time. After the loop executes, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainders of n % i for each i in the range [1, k], i is the last value of the iteration, and remainder is the remainder of n % i for that last value of i.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the relationship between them, return either 'No', 'Yes', or perform the described iteration process.
