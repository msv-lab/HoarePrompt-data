According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
