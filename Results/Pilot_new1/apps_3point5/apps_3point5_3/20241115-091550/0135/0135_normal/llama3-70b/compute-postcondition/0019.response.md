Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `remainder` is the result of n modulo i. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
