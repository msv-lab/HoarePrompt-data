Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The value of `i` is 3, so `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` when divided by 3. The value of `remainder` can be any value between 0 and 2 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is 3, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 2.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is 3, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 2**
