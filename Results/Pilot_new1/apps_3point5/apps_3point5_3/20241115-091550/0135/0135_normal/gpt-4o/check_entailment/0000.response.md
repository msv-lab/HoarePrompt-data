Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. If k is greater than or equal to n, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it iterates through the range [1, k] and keeps track of the remainders seen so far. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
