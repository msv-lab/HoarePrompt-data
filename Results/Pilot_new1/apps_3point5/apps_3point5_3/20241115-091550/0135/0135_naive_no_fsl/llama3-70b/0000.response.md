Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if the remainder is already in the set. If it is, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, if all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
