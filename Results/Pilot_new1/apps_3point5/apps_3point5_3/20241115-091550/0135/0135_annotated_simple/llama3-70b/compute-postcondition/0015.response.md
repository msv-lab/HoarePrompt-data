According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k`, `remainder` is not in `seen`, and `remainder` has been added to `seen`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder` must not be in `seen` and `i` must be less than `k`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `remainder` is not in `seen` and `i` should be incremented to `i+1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k` and is not in `seen`, `remainder` has been added to `seen`, `i` is `k+1`**
