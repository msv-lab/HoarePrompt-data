Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1. `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`, where `i` is equal to `k`. `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k`, `remainder` is not in `seen`, and `remainder` has been added to `seen`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits.**
