According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to k (inclusive). Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `i` is 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1**
