According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i` (adjusted to be less than the original value), `remainder` are integers. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the original value of `k` and `k` should be greater than the adjusted `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i` (further decreased), `remainder` are integers, where `i` is less than the original value of `k` and `k` is greater than the adjusted `i`**
