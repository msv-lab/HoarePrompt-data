Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The states of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `i` (further decreased), `remainder` are integers, where `i` is less than the original value of `k` and `k` is greater than the adjusted `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i` (further decreased), `remainder` are integers, where `i` is less than the original value of `k` and `k` is greater than the adjusted `i`**
