The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` from the user input. It then processes the votes based on the indices of 'D' and non-'D' characters in the string. The function updates two queues, `d_queue` and `r_queue`, by popping and potentially appending values based on certain conditions. After processing, if `d_queue` is not empty, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed. The function does not have explicit return values but prints the result based on the processed input data.
