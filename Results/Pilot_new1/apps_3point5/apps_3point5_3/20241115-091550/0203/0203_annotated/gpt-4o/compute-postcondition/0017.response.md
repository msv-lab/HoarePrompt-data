Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string based on user input with length greater than the current index `i`. If `v` is equal to 'D', `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`, otherwise `r_queue` contains the appended index `i`. In both cases, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain the same if the corresponding condition is not met. `i` is updated to the next index, and `v` is the next character in the `votes` string.***
