Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, the loop will execute. After the loop finishes, votes is a string based on user input, d_queue is either updated with the front value removed and potentially appended with d_index + n, r_queue is either updated with the front value removed and potentially appended with r_index + n. d_index and r_index are updated accordingly. If either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty during the loop execution, the loop will stop. If d_queue is not empty, 'D' is printed. If d_queue is empty, 'R' is printed.***
