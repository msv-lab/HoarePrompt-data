Example Answer:
The value at the front of `r_queue` is removed and assigned to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` is not empty, `r_index` will be updated with the front value that was removed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` is updated with the front value removed.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` is updated with the front value removed**
