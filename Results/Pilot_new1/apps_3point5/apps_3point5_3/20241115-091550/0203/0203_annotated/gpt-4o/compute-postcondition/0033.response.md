According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `votes` is a string based on user input
- `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index
- `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index
- `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character popped from `d_queue`
- `r_index` is the index of the first non-'D' character popped from `r_queue`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` should append the value `d_index + n`
- If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` should append the value of `r_index + n`

State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty lists based on the adjusted conditions described above, `d_index` and `r_index` are updated accordingly**
