Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `d_queue` list and assigns it to the variable `d_index`. The value of `d_index` will be the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string. The `d_queue` list will be updated to remove the popped index. The `r_queue` list remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character popped from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character popped from `d_queue`**
