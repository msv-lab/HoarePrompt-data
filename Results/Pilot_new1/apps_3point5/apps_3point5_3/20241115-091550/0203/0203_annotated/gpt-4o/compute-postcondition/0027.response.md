According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `votes` is a string based on user input
- `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index
- `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index**
