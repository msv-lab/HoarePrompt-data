Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters. If `fractions` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1, resulting in either `depublicans` being 2 and `remocrats` being 0. If `fractions` is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1, resulting in either `depublicans` being 1 and `remocrats` being 1 or `depublicans` being 1 and `remocrats` being 2.***
