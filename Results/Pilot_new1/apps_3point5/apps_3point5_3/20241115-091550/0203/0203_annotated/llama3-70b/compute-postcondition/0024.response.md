Postcondition: ***If `fractions` is an empty string, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are both 0. If `fractions` contains only 'D' characters, `depublicans` is equal to the length of `fractions`, `remocrats` is 0. If `fractions` does not contain any 'D' characters, `remocrats` is equal to the length of `fractions`, `depublicans` is 0. After the if-else block executes, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
