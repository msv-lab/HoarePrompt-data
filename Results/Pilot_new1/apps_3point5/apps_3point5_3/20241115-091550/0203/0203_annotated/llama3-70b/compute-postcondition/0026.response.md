Functionality: ** The function reads an integer from the user and a string of characters representing fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string. If the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of 'R' characters, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
