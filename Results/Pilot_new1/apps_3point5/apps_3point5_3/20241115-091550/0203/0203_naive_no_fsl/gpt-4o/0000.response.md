Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the described voting procedure. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and simulates the voting process by popping the first person from each queue and either adding them back to the end of the queue or skipping their turn based on the order of their statements. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the last remaining person eligible to vote. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
