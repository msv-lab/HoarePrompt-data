Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, but it represents the count of 'D' fractions. After execution, `depublicans` will increase by 1, representing an additional 'D' fraction. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is incremented by 1, `remocrats` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is incremented by 1, `remocrats` is an integer representing the count of non-'D' fractions**
