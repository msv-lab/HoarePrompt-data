Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively. If the loop does not execute (i.e., the list `fractions` is empty), then `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If the loop does execute, for each fraction in the list, if the fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is incremented by 1. After the if-else block executes, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
