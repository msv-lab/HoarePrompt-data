Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` will be updated based on the value popped. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, d_queue and r_queue are not empty**
