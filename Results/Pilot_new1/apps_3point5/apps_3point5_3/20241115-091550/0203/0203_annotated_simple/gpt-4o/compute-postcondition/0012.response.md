Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The value of `i` is initialized to 0, so after execution, `r_queue` will have 0 appended to it. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1 consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', `r_queue` contains 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1 consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', `r_queue` contains 0**
