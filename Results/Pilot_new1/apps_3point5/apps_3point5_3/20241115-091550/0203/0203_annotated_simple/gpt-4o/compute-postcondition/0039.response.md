According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. `d_queue` needs to be updated by appending `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`.
2. `r_queue` needs to be updated by appending `r_index + n` if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.

State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, d_queue and r_queue are not empty. If d_index < r_index, then d_queue is appended with d_index + n. If d_index >= r_index, then r_queue is appended with r_index + n.**
