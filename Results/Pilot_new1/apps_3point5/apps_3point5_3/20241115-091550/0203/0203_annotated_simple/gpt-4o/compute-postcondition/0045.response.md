Postcondition: ***Both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty. If d_queue is not empty, 'D' is printed. If d_queue is empty, 'R' is printed. The loop will continue to execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty. The variables d_index and r_index are updated based on the popped characters. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n. The loop will terminate if either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty.***
