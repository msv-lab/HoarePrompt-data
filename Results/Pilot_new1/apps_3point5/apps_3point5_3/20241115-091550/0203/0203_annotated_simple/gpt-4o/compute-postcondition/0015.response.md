Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`, and `i` is a positive integer. The previous state of `d_queue` is updated with the addition of `i+1`. The state of `r_queue` remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1, d_queue is updated with i+1, r_queue is unknown.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1, d_queue is updated with i+1, r_queue is unknown**
