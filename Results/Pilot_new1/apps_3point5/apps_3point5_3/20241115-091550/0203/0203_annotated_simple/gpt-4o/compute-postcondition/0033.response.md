According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- n is a positive integer
- votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'
- d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue
- r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue
- d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index
- r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index

For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to have at least one element in them. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, d_queue and r_queue are not empty**
