Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `d_queue`, and `i` is initialized to 0. The `d_queue` will contain the value of `i`, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1 consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue contains 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1 consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue contains 0**
