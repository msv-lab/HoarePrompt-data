Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. Since r_queue remains unchanged and contains the indices of 'R' characters, r_index will contain the index of the popped 'R' character. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue may be updated with remaining indices of 'D' characters, r_queue remains unchanged, d_index contains the index of the popped 'D' character, r_index contains the index of the popped 'R' character.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue may be updated with remaining indices of 'D' characters, r_queue remains unchanged, d_index contains the index of the popped 'D' character, r_index contains the index of the popped 'R' character**
