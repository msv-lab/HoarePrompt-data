Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` is assumed to be a list. The value popped from the list is now stored in `r_index`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`**
