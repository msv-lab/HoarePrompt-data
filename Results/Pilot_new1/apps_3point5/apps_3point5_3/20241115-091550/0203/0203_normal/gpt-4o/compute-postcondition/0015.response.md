Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 2. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length at least 1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` contains 2, `r_queue` states depend on the first character in `votes`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length at least 1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` contains 2, `r_queue` states depend on the first character in `votes`, `i` is 2**
