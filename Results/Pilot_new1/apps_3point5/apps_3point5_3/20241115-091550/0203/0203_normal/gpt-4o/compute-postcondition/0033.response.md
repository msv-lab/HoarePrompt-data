According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `r_queue` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d_queue` also needs to be not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` can either be longer by one element if `d_index < r_index` or shorter by one element if `d_index >= r_index`, and `r_queue` is not empty after the execution of the if-else block**
