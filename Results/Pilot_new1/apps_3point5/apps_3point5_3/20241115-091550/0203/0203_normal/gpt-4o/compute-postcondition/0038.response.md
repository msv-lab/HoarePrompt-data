Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` can either be longer by one element if `d_index < r_index` or shorter by one element if `d_index >= r_index`, `r_queue` is not empty after the execution of the if-else block, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`. If `d_index < r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. If `d_index >= r_index`, `r_queue` has a new element added which is the result of `r_index + n`.***
