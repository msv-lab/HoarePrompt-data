According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the fractions list must have at least 1 fraction, and the fraction is the first fraction in the list. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, fraction is the first fraction in the list**
