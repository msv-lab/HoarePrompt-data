Postcondition: ***`fractions` is a list of fractions, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively, `n` is an integer. If the list is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If the list is not empty, after the loop execution, `depublicans` contains the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` contains the count of non-'D' fractions, and `n` remains an input integer. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
