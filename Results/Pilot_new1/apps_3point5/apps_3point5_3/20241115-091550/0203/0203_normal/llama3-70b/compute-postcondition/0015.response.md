Example Answer:
If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` will be incremented by 2. If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` will be incremented by 2. Since `depublicans` is incremented by 1 in this code snippet, the output state will depend on the value of `fraction` and the initial state of `depublicans` and `remocrats`. 
Output State: **Depublicans and Remocrats will be updated based on the value of `fraction` and their previous states.**
