Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The calculation is done by finding the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program handles the conversion of the triangle side lengths as required, ensuring that at each step, the triangle remains non-degenerate. The output is the minimum number of seconds required, which is the expected result according to the problem description.
