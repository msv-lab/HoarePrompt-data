Correctness: False

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y, which involves a specific sequence of operations to modify the sides of the triangle. The program does not implement this logic and only calculates the absolute difference between x and y. Thus, the program is incorrect for this problem.
