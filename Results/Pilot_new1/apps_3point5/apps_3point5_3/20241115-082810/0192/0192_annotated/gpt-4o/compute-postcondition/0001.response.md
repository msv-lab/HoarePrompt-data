Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). Since x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be the same for any valid input values of x and y. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is constant.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is constant**
