Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is calculated using the `abs()` function and printed. Since `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the difference between them will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
