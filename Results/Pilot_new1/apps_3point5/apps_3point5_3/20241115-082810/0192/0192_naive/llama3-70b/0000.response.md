Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes the input values x and y, calculates the absolute difference between them, and then prints the result. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, as the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y is indeed the absolute difference between x and y, which is correctly calculated and printed by the program. 

For all the provided examples and potential cases within the given constraints, the program works as expected and provides the correct output.
