Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The program calculates this by finding the absolute difference between x and y, then dividing it by 2. If the difference is odd, it adds 1 to the result. This logic correctly handles all cases where the side lengths are within the given constraints.

For example, in the first sample test case where x=6 and y=3, the program correctly outputs 4, as Memory can transform the triangle from (6,6,6) to (3,3,3) in 4 steps.

Similarly, for the other sample test cases, the program provides the correct minimum number of seconds required to obtain the desired equilateral triangle.
