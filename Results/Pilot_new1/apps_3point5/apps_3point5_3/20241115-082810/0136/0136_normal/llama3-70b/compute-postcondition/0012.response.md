Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings with no leading zeros. It then compares the integer values represented by `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not return any specific output. However, it is important to note that the function lacks error handling for cases where the input strings do not represent valid non-negative integers. **
