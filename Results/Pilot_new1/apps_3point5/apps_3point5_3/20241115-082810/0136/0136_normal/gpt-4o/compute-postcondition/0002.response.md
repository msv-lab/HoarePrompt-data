Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing leading zeros. If `data[1]` is '000123', then `b` will be '123'. Since `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
