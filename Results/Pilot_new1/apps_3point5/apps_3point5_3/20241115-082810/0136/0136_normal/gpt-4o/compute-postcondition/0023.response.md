Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If the value of `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If the value of `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If the value of `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The length of `a` is equal to or less than the length of `b`, and the values of `a` and `b` are appropriately compared and printed based on their relationships.***
