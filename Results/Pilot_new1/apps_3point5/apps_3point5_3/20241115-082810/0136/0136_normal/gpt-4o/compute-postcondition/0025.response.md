Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If the value of `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If the value of `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If the value of `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. Edge cases are handled where `a` or `b` are empty strings, in which case they are updated to '0'. The program correctly compares the lengths and values of `a` and `b` and prints the appropriate comparison symbol.***
