The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, each with at most 10^6 digits. The function compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if they are equal. If `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is treated as '0'. The function correctly handles comparisons between `a` and `b` based on their lengths and values.
