Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings without leading zeros, compares them, and prints the corresponding symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on their values. The code annotations provide a clear explanation of the program logic, and after reviewing both the code and annotations, it can be concluded that the program handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
