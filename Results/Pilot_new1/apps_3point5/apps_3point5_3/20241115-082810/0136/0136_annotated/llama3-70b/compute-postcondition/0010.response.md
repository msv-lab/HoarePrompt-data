Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the input string without leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'. The program ensures that `a` is not equal to `b` and handles all possible cases where `a` is either less than or greater than `b`, providing the corresponding output.***
