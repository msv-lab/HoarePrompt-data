The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings without leading zeros from the user input. It then compares the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The function handles all cases where `a` is not equal to `b` and provides the corresponding output. The function does not have a return value specified.
