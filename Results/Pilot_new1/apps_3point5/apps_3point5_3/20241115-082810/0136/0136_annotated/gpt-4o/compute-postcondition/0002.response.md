Example Answer:
The value of `b` is modified by removing any leading zeros from the second element of the `data` list. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed**
