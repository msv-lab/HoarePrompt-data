Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than b, it prints '<'. If they are equal, it prints '='. The function handles edge cases where `a` or `b` are empty strings by updating them to '0'. The comparison is accurate in all cases, including when `a` and `b` are both '0'. The return value of the function is not specified. **
