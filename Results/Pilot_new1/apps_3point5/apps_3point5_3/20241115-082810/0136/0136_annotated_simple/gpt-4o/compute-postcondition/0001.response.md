Example Answer: 
The code snippet removes any leading zeros from the string stored at index 0 of the list `data` and assigns the result to variable `a`. If the string at index 0 of `data` contains leading zeros, they will be removed. The value of `b` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
