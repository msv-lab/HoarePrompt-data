Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros. The initial state does not provide the value of `data`, so we can only assume that `data` is a list containing at least two elements. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing any leading zeros from the second element of `data`.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing any leading zeros from the second element of `data`**
