Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('>')` simply prints the character `>`. It does not affect the variables `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. They are not equal after removing any leading zeros, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`**
