According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3.
State: **`MOD` is assigned the value 1000003, `total_days` is assigned the value 2, `numerator` is assigned a new value based on the calculation, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
