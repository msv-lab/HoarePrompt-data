According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is assigned the value 1000003, `total_days` is assigned the value 2, `numerator` is assigned the value 2, `denominator` is assigned a new value based on the calculation, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is assigned the value 1000003, `total_days` is assigned the value 2, `numerator` is assigned the value 2, `denominator` is assigned a new value based on the calculation, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
