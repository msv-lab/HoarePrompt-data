The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The variable `MOD` is assigned the value 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1, and then returns. Otherwise, the program does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, assign a value to `MOD`, and print 1 and 1 if a specific condition is met.
