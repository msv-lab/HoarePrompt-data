Example Answer:
`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. Therefore, `p_total` is now equal to `denominator` and `p_no_shared` is now equal to `numerator`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
