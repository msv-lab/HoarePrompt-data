Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `p_no_shared` and `p_total` are given as `numerator` and `denominator` respectively. Therefore, `p_shared` is calculated based on these values. 
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula**
