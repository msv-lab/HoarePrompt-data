The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It then executes a loop to update the values of `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. The final value of `a` after the loop execution is returned. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to perform a mathematical operation on `a` and `b` based on the provided algorithm.
