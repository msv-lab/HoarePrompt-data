Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is 2 to the power of `n`. The value of `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, so `denominator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`. The values of `numerator`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
