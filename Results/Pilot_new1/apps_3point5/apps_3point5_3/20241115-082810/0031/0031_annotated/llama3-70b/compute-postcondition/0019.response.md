Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the remainder of the division of `numerator` by (10^6 + 3) and `denominator` by (10^6 + 3) after performing certain operations involving `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator`. The function aims to return these remainders as a tuple.**
