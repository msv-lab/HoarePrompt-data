Output State: **If k is at least 1, then the loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, `numerator` will be multiplied by the product of (total_days - i) for each iteration, `denominator` will be multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` for each iteration. If k is 0, the loop will not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` will remain as 1. Finally, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
