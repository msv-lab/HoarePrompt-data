Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0. Since `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0, `total_days - i` is equal to `2^n`. Therefore, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
