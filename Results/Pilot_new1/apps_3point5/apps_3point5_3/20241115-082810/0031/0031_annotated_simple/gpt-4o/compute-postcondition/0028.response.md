The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The variable `MOD` is assigned the value 1000003. If k is greater than 2 raised to the power of n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, the program does not return anything. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 2 raised to the power of n, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it does not return anything.
