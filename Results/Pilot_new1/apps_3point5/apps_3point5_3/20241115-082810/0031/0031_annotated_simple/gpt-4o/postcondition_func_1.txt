The function func_2 accepts two integer parameters n and k. If k is greater than 2 raised to the power of n, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates values for p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g based on the loop iterations. Finally, it calls func_1 with A and B, updates A and B, then prints the results.
