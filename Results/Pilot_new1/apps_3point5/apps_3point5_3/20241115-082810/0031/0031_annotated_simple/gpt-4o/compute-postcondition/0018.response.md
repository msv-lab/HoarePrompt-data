Output State: 

If `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `k` times. After the loop executes, MOD will remain assigned the value 1000003, total_days will be assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n, numerator will be updated to the final value calculated by multiplying the current value of numerator with (total_days - k) % MOD, denominator will be updated to the final value calculated by multiplying the current value of denominator with total_days % MOD. `i` will be equal to `k` at the end of the loop.

If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the values of numerator and denominator will remain 1. 

Output State: **If k is greater than 0, numerator and denominator are updated after k iterations of the loop. If k is 0 or negative, numerator and denominator remain 1.**
