Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` after k iterations of the loop. If k is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` remains 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is updated based on `numerator` after k iterations, if k is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` remains 1.
Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is updated based on `numerator` after k iterations, if k is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` remains 1**
