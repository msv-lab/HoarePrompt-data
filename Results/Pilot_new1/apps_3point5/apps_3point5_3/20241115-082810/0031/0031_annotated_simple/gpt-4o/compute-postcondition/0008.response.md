According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is assigned the value 1, denominator is assigned the value 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
