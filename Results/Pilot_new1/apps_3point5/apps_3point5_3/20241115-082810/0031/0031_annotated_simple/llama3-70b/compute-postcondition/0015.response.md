Example Answer: 
The numerator is divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd). The previous value of the numerator is the result of the product of (total_days - 1), (total_days - 2), ..., (total_days - k), and the denominator is the result of the product of total_days raised to the power of k. After dividing by gcd, the new value of the numerator is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is the updated result after dividing by gcd, denominator remains the same, total_days remains the same, i remains the same, k remains the same, gcd remains the same.
Output State: **numerator is the updated result after dividing by gcd, denominator remains the same, total_days remains the same, i remains the same, k remains the same, gcd remains the same**
