According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1), (`total_days` - 2), and (`total_days` - 2), `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 since it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
