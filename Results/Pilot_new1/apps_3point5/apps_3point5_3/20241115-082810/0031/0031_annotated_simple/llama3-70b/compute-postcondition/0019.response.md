Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both being integers. It calculates the remainder of the division of numerator by denominator, where numerator is the product of (total_days - 1), (total_days - 2), ..., (total_days - k), and denominator is the product of total_days raised to the power of k. The function then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numerator and denominator, divides both by the gcd, and returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). The functionality of the function is to perform these calculations and return the remainders.**
