Example Answer:
`denominator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. The value of `gcd` remains the same, so the `denominator` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain the same.
Output State: **numerator is the updated result after dividing by gcd, denominator is updated after integer division with gcd, total_days remains the same, i remains the same, k remains the same, gcd remains the same**
