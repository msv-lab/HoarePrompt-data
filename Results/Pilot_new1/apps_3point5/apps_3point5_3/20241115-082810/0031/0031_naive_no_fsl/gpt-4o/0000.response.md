Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario.
2. The program handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by directly outputting 1 1.
3. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the result modulo 10^6 + 3 as required. 
4. The program calculates the irreducible fraction A/B correctly by finding the greatest common divisor between A and B using the func_1 function.
