Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated based on the previous values of `total_days` and `k`, and `i` is k-1. If k is 0 or negative, `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 1. `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. After that, `numerator` is divided by `gcd` using floor division.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values are adjusted based on the conditions, and `numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`**
