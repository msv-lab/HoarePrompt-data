Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `numerator` is the result of multiplying all numbers from `total_days` to `total_days - k + 1`, `denominator` is the result of multiplying all numbers from `total_days` to `total_days - k`, `i` is k-1. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 1.**
