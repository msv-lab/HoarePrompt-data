The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It assigns the value 1000003 to the variable MOD. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing. The functionality of the function is to handle cases where k is greater than 1 shifted left by n by printing 1 and 1, otherwise it returns nothing.
