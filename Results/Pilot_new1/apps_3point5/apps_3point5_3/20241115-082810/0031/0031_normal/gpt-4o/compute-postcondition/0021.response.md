Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. p_shared is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD. The values of p_no_shared, p_total, and MOD are used in the calculation. 
Output State: **p_no_shared has the updated value based on the condition, p_total retains its value, and p_shared is calculated using the updated values**
