The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It then executes a loop where the values of `a` and `b` are updated until `b` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the final value of `a` after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input integers `a` and `b`.
