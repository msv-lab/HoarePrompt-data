Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers n and k as input.
- It then checks if n is less than k, and if so, prints -1.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence of positive numbers.
- It then iterates from 1 to k, adding each number to the sequence and subtracting it from n.
- If at any point n becomes less than the current number, it breaks out of the loop.
- Finally, it checks if the length of the sequence is equal to k. If not, it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it prints the sequence of positive numbers as a space-separated string.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the expected output. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
