Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the new values depend on the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have new values based on the initial values.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have new values based on the initial values**
