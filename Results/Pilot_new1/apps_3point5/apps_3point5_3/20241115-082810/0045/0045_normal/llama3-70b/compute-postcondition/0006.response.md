Output State: **If b is greater than 0, after the loop finishes, a will be 0 and b will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b. If b is 0, a will be the GCD of the initial values of a and b, and b will remain 0. If a or b is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute and the values of a and b will remain unchanged.**
