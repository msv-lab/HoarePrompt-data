Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and then `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` was initially 0 and `b` is non-zero, the value of `a` after the operation will be 0. The value of `b` after the operation will be the remainder of dividing the initial `a` (which is 0) by the initial `b` (non-zero). Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 0, `b` is the remainder of dividing the initial `a` by the initial `b`.
Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is the remainder of dividing the initial `a` by the initial `b`**
