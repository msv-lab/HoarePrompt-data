According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 0, and `b` is the remainder of dividing the initial `a` by the initial `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to be not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is 0, `b` is the remainder of dividing the initial `a` by the initial `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
