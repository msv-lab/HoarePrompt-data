Output State: If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, where `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 2` and `remainder` is equal to -2. If `remainder` is 0, the loop breaks out, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.
