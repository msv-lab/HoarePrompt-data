According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` is 0, then the program breaks out of the loop.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the loop is iterating backwards from `k - 1` to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be equal to -1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1**
