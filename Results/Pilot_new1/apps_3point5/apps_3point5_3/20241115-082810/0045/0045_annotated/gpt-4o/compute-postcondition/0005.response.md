Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the difference between `n` and `d` multiplied by `min_sum`. The values of `min_sum` and `d` are already defined in the initial state, so we can directly calculate `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the calculated value of `n - d * min_sum`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the calculated value of `n - d * min_sum`**
