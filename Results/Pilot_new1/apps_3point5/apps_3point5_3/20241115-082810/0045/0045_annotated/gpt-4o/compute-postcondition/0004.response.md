Example Answer:
The value of `n` is divided by `min_sum`, which is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, and `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`**
