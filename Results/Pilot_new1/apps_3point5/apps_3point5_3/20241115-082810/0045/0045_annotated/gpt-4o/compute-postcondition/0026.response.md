The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. 

In Case 1, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.

In Case 2, the program returns the updated sequence after the loop execution. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `k` as `min_sum`, and return -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the updated sequence after the loop execution.
