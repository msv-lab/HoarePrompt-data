Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `b` is a non-zero positive integer. After the operation, `a` will have the value of the previous `b`, and `b` will have the remainder of the division of the previous `a` by the previous `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is a non-zero positive integer.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is a non-zero positive integer**
