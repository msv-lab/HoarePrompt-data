Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder left after forming the sequence with common divisor d.
5. It constructs the sequence by multiplying d with increasing integers from 1 to k.
6. It then distributes the remainder among the elements of the sequence starting from the end to maximize the greatest common divisor.
7. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise returns -1.

The program handles all potential cases and generates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with maximum greatest common divisor.
