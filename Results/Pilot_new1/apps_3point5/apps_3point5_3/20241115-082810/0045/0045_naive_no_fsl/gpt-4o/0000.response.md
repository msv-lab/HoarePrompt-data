Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. It then checks if this minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
2. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, the program calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum. It then calculates the remainder by subtracting d * min_sum from n.
3. The program then constructs the sequence by iterating over k numbers and assigning d * (i + 1) to each element. It then distributes the remainder among the elements in a way that the sequence remains strictly increasing.
4. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise outputs -1.
5. The program handles all potential cases as per the problem description and provides a valid sequence if one exists.
