Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes two integers n and k as input.
2. It then checks if n is less than k and prints -1 if true, which aligns with the problem description.
3. If n is greater than or equal to k, the program generates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n.
4. The program ensures that the generated sequence has the maximum possible greatest common divisor by incrementing the numbers in the sequence.
5. Finally, the program outputs the generated sequence or -1 if no such sequence is possible.
6. The logic used in the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
