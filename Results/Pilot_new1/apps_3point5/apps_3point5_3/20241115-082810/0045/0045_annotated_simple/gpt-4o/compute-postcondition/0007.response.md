According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states so that the loop executes correctly. 

State: **`min_sum` is greater than `n`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`.**
