The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: The function calculates `min_sum` based on the value of `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

Case_2: After the loop execution, the function returns the list 'sequence'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate `min_sum` based on `k`, and return -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the list 'sequence' after the loop execution.
