Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is a helper function that can be used to calculate the greatest common divisor of elements in a sequence, which is a crucial step in finding the sequence with the maximal greatest common divisor as required by the problem description. The function itself is correct and follows the logic of the Euclidean algorithm, so it can be used as a reliable helper function in solving the main problem.
