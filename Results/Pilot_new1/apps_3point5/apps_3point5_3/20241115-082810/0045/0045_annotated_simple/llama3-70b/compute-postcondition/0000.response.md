Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are positive integers. Therefore, after execution, `a` will have the value of the original `b`, and `b` will have the remainder when dividing the original `a` by the original `b`. 
Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of `a` divided by the original `b`**
