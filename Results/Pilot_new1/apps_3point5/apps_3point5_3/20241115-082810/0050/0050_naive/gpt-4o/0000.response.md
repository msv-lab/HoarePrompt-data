Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening based on the given inputs. It considers the scenario where the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price and handles it by not taking any action. It also calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles and then calculates the total bourles after selling those shares at the maximum sell price. The logic seems to cover all possible scenarios and the examples provided in the problem description work correctly.
