Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order**
