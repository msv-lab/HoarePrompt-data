According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 2**
