Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of `b` are a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers. After sorting in descending order, `b` is now sorted in reverse. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order**
