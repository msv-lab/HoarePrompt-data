Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `b[i]` are known. Therefore, the new value of `r` after execution is `r + shares * b[i]`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r + shares * b[i]`, `shares`, `i`, `s`, and `b` are updated appropriately for the next iteration**
