Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `shares` are updated, `s` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order, `r` remains greater than or equal to all elements in the list `s`, `i` is less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
