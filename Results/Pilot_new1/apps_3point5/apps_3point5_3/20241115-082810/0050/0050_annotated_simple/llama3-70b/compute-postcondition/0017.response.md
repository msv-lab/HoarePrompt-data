Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1. If r >= s[i], `shares` is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], the program breaks out of the loop.***
