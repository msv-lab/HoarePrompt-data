The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with lists `s` and `b`. It then sorts `s` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. The function iterates over the elements in `s` and updates the `shares` variable based on the division of `r` by elements in `s`. After that, it iterates over the elements in `b` and updates `r` based on the product of `shares` and the elements in `b`. The final value of `r` is printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
