Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, when `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`, the program calculates `max_shares` as `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`.***
