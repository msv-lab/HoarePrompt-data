Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by first calculating the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price. If this condition is true, it prints the initial amount of bourles `r`. If the condition is false, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling the shares at the maximum sell price. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
