Example Answer:
The code snippet converts the input values into a list of integers and assigns it to variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers**
