Example Answer:
The list `s` is created by mapping the input values to integers after splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, and `s` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, and `s` is a list of integers created from the input**
