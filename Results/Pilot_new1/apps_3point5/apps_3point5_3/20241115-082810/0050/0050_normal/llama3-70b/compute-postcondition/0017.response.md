Postcondition: ***n, m, r, shares are integers. If r is greater than or equal to the i-th element of sorted list s, shares is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r is less than the i-th element of sorted list s, the program breaks out of the loop.***
