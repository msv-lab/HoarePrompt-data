Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the list of integers created by mapping the input to integers and splitting it. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, and `s` is a list of integers created from the input; `b` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, and `s` is a list of integers created from the input; `b` is a list of integers created from the input**
