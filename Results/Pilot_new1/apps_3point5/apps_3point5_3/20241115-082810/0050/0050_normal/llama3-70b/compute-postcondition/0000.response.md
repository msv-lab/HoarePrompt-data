Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The input is expected to be in the format of three integers separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges**
