Output State: **n, m, r, shares are integers. If r is greater than or equal to the (i+1)-th element of sorted list s, shares is increased by the integer division of r by s[i+1] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i+1]. If r is less than the (i+1)-th element of sorted list s, the program breaks out of the loop. `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.**
