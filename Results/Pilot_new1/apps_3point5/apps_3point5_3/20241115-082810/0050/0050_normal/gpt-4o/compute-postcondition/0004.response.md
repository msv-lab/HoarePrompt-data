Example Answer: 
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value of `b`, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`. The values of `b` are obtained by splitting the input string. After execution, `max_sell_price` holds the maximum value of `b`, and `min_buy_price` holds the minimum value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`**
