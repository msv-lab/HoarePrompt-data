Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are known, so the output state is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`**
