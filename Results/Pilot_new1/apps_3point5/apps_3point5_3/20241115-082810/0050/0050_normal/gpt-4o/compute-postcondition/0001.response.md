Example Answer:
The input string is split into integers and stored in list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the split values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers**
