Postcondition: ***`b` contains integers from the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is the sum of the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`, and the function prints `total_bourles`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios involving the comparison between `max_sell_price` and `min_buy_price`, ensuring the correct execution and output of the program.***
