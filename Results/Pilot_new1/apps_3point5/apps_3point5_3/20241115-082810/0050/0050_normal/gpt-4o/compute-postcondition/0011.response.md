Example Answer:
The `print(total_bourles)` statement outputs the value stored in the variable `total_bourles`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` holds the calculated total value, and the value stored in `total_bourles` is printed.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` holds the calculated total value, and the value stored in `total_bourles` is printed**
