Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. It correctly reads the prices for buying and selling shares and sorts them accordingly.
3. The program then iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible with the available bourles.
4. It then iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the shares bought, maximizing the profit.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum number of bourles after the evening, which is the correct output based on the problem description.
6. The logic of the program ensures that it handles all possible cases of buying and selling shares with the given constraints.
