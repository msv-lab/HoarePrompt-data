Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates `max_shares` as the result of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`, then prints the value of `total_bourles`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specified return value.**
