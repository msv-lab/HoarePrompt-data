Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the values entered by the user after splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `b` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers**
