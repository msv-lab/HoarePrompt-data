Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles.**
