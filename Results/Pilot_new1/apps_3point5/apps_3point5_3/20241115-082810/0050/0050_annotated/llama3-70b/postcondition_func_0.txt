The function `func` reads input values n, m, and r. It then reads lists of integers s and b, sorts them, and calculates the distribution of shares based on the values of r, s, and b. The function updates the remaining amount r after distributing shares and prints the final value of r. If n is 0 or r is less than the first element in s, the distribution of shares does not occur. The function does not return any value.
