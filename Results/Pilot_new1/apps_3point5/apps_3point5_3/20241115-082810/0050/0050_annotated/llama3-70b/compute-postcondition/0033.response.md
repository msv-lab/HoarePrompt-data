Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `b[i]` are known. Therefore, the new value of `r` can be calculated based on the given values. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on the formula, `i` is 1**
