Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Since `shares` is 0, the value of `r` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 2, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 2, `shares` is 0**
