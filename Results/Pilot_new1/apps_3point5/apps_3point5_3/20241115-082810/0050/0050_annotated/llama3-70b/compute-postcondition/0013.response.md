According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. This means the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers, `i` is 0**
