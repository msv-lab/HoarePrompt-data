Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `shares` are integers, `s`, `b` are integers, `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division result of `r` divided by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program exits the loop.***
