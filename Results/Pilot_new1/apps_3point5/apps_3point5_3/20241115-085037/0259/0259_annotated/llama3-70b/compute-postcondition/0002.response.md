According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
