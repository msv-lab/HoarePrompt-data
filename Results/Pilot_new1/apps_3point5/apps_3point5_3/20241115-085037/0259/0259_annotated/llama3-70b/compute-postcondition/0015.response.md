According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` will be a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values from the first tuple in the list. Additionally, `t` must be a positive integer satisfying the constraints. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `s` and `d` are integers from the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0**
