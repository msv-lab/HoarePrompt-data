Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `s` and `d` are integers from the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is now equal to the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is equal to i + 1, `i` is 0, `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`, and `min_time` is the minimum time calculated among all previous iterations.***
