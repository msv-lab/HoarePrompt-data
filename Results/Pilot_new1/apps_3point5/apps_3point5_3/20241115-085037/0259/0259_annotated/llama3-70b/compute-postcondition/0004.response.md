Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from splitting the input, so they are integers. The list `buses` now contains one tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains one tuple, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains one tuple, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
