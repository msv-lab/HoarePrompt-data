Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time`. After this calculation, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`. The value of `n` remains the same, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
