Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown in the initial state, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is dependent on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is dependent on the value of `i`**
