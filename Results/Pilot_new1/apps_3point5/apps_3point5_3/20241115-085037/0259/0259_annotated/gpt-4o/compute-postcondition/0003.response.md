Example Answer:
`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `bus_routes[i]` are unknown, but `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0**
