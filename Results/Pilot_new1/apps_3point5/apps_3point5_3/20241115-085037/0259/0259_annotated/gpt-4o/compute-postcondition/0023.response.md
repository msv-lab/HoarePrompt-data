Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`. `n` remains the same. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the variables involved in the program fragment.***
