Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated, `n` is updated, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is less than the updated `n`. `wait_time` is 0.
