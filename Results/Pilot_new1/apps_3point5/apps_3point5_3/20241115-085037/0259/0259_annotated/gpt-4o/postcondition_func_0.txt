The function func_1 accepts the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes with their arrival times and intervals. It iterates through each bus route to calculate the minimum wait time for Serval. It then returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time (index + 1) or -1 if no routes were chosen. The function handles cases where Serval arrives before a bus, when the wait time is 0, and in all other scenarios to determine the appropriate wait time for each route.
