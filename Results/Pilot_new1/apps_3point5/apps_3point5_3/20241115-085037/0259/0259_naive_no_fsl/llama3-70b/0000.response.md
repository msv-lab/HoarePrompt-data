Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then stores the arrival time and interval between buses for each route. The program calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus of each route, and selects the route with the minimum time difference as the answer. This logic follows the problem description accurately, and the program outputs the correct bus route for Serval to take. The program also handles multiple buses arriving at the same time by selecting any of them as a valid answer.
