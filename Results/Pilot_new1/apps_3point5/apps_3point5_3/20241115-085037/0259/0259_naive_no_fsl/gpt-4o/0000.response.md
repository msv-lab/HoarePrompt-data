Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time Serval goes to the station and the schedule of buses for that route.
3. The program then determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time calculated for each route and returns the correct route number.
4. The output is as expected and follows the problem description for all possible cases.
