Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list after the previous iteration. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum time, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the current bus schedule. This process is repeated for each bus schedule in the list, ensuring that `min_time` holds the minimum time and `ans` holds the corresponding bus index that provides the minimum time for reaching the destination.***
