Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules, `_` is the index of the last iteration. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity.**
