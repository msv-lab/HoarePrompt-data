Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `s` and `d` are dependent on the input, so they can vary. The variables `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` with the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` with the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is 2**
