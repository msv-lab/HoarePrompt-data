Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, `s_i` and `d_i` are the source and destination of the ith bus route in the list. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The postcondition covers scenarios where `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time` based on the calculations involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.***
