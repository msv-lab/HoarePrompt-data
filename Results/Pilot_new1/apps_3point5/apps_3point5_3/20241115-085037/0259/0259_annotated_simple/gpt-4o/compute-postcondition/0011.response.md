Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i and d_i are assigned from the first tuple in bus_routes, s_i is less than t. If ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - ((t - s_i) % d_i). This covers all cases and edge scenarios of the program fragment execution.***
