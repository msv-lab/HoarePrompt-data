Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - ((t - s_i) % d_i). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment execution. Additionally, the `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`***
