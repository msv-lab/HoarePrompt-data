Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated by subtracting the destination time `t` from the source time `s_i`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, `s_i` and `d_i` are the source and destination of the ith bus route in the list, and `wait_time` is the calculated wait time.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, `s_i` and `d_i` are the source and destination of the ith bus route in the list, and `wait_time` is the calculated wait time**
