Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, `s_i` and `d_i` are the source and destination of the ith bus route in the list. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if else block based on the initial values of the variables.***
