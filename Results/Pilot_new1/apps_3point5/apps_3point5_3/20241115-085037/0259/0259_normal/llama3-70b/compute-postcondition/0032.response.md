Output State: 
- `min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated after iterating through all buses in the list.
- `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time after iterating through all buses in the list.
- `buses` is a list of buses with at least 1 element.
- If the loop does not execute (empty list of buses), `min_time` remains positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1.
- The loop iterates through each bus, calculates the time based on the current bus's schedule, and updates `min_time` and `ans` accordingly if a new minimum time is found.
