According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 3 buses, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is a positive integer, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 2 elements. To execute the loop one more time, the list of buses must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 3 elements**
