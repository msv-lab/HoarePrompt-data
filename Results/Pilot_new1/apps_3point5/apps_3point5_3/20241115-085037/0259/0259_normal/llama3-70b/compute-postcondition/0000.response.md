Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the input after splitting, where `map` converts the input to integers. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer**
