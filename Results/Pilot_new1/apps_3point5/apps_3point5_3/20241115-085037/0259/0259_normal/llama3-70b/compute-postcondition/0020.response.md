Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 1 element, `i` is an integer representing the index, `s` and `d` are the values of the first element in the list, and `time` is the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum time, and `ans` is updated to the index of the current bus. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
