Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the route number with the minimum wait time, `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values based on `bus_routes[i]`. The `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop code. After each iteration, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum `wait_time` value, and `chosen_route` is updated to the corresponding route number.**
