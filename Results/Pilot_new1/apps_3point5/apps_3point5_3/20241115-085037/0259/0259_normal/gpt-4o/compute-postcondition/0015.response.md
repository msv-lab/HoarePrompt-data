Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i) / d_i`. Additionally, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`**
