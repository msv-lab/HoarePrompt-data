Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on calculations, `n` is greater than the current value, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`. This postcondition covers all scenarios where the `wait_time` is either 0 or calculated based on the given conditions, ensuring the proper handling of edge cases.***
