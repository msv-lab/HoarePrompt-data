According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity and chosen_route is assigned the value -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, min_wait_time should remain positive infinity, chosen_route should stay as -1, and `n` should be greater than 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
