Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station correctly.
- It correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given conditions.
- It determines the route number with the minimum wait time and returns that route number.
- The code handles the case where `n` is 0 by not executing the loop.
- The code does not need to handle cases where multiple routes have the same minimum wait time as the problem description allows for printing any of them.
- The output hints are consistent with the code and provide a clear explanation of the functionality of the `func_1` function.
