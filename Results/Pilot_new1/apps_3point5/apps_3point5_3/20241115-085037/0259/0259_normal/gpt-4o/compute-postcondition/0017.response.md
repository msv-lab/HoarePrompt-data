According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time, and `n` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the current `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.
- Update `chosen_route` to the corresponding route number based on the current iteration.
- Update `min_wait_time` to the minimum `wait_time` value based on the current iteration.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time for the current iteration, `n` is greater than 0**
