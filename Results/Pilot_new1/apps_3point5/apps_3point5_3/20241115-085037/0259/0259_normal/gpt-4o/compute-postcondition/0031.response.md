Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `t` is the current time, `s_i` is the start time, and `d_i` is the duration. The output state will be updated with the new calculated value of `wait_time`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on calculations, `chosen_route` is updated based on calculations, `n` is greater than the current value, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values, `wait_time` is calculated**
