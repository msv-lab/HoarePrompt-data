Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `t`, `wait_time`, `i` are all updated based on calculations and assignments. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This postcondition ensures that the variables are correctly updated based on the comparison of `wait_time` and `min_wait_time`, covering all scenarios where `wait_time` is either less than `min_wait_time` or equal to it, thus handling all possible edge cases.***
