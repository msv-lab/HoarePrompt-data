The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer. The program returns the value of `x` based on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `multiplier`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and return the value of `x` based on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `multiplier`.
