Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the k-rounding of a given positive integer `n`. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and calculates the value of `x` based on the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`, where `multiplier` is calculated as `10 ** k`. This formula ensures that the resulting integer `x` ends with `k` or more zeros and is divisible by `n`. The code also handles the input correctly by reading the values of `n` and `k` from the input and printing the result of the `func_1` function. The output matches the expected k-rounding of `n` as described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
