Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` can be any value from 0 to 8, `x` can take on values from 1 to 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is a positive integer that can range from 1 to 100000000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is a positive integer that can range from 1 to 100000000**
