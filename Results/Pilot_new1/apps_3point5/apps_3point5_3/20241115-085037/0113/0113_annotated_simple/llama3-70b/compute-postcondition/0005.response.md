According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of `n % x != 0`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to remain a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`**
