Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The input is split by space, and the values are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
