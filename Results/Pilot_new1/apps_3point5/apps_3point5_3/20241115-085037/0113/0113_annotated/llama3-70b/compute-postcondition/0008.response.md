Output State: **If n is divisible by 10^k then the loop will not execute and n will remain the same. If n is not divisible by 10^k then the loop will execute until n becomes divisible by 10^k. In this case, n will be the smallest multiple of 10^k greater than the initial n, k will remain the same, and x will be recalculated as 10^k with the same value of k.**
