Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The program calculates a value based on the input parameters using the formula x = n * (10^k // gcd(n, 10^k)), where gcd is the greatest common divisor function. The function then returns the calculated value of `x`. **
