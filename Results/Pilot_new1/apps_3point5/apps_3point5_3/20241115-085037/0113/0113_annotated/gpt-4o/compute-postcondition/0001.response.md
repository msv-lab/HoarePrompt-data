Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` can be any positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `multiplier` can be any of the specified values. The `math.gcd()` function calculates the greatest common divisor between `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the value of `x` will be an integer multiple of `n` that is divisible by `multiplier`. 
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; x is the result of the calculation described above**
