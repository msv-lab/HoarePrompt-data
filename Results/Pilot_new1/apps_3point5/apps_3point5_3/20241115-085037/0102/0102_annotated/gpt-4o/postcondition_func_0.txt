The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns the string representation of the number n based on the given conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the `teens` list. If n is between 10 and 99, it returns the name of the tens place from the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10; otherwise, it concatenates the name of the tens place with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words. The postcondition covers various scenarios including multiples of 10, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers between 20 and 99.
