Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of strings containing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings containing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings containing number names for tens from ten to ninety. n is an integer outside the range of 11 to 19, and n is an integer between 10 and 99. If n is divisible by 10, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when n is a multiple of 10, n is between 10 and 19, and n is between 20 and 99.***
