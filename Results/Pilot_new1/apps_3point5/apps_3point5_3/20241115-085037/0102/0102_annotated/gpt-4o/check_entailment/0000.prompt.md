You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

Annotated Program:

def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string representation of the number 'n' from the list 'ones'
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string representation of the number n in the list 'teens'
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the name of the tens place of the integer n
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the number n in words
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ones` is a list of strings containing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings containing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings containing number names for tens from ten to ninety. n is an integer outside the range of 11 to 19, and n is an integer between 10 and 99. If n is divisible by 10, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when n is a multiple of 10, n is between 10 and 19, and n is between 20 and 99.

If 10 <= n <= 99, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words.

If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the string representation of the number n in the `teens` list. If 10 <= n <= 99, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words.

#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns the string representation of the number n based on the given conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the `teens` list. If n is between 10 and 99, it returns the name of the tens place from the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10; otherwise, it concatenates the name of the tens place with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words. The postcondition covers various scenarios including multiples of 10, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers between 20 and 99.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
