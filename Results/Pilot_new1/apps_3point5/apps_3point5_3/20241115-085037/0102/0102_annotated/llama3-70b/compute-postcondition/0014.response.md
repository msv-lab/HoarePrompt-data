Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It takes an integer input `s` between 0 and 99 and converts it into its textual representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the string representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. For values between 20 and 99, it constructs the textual representation by combining the tens and ones places. The code accounts for all edge cases within the specified range of `s` to provide accurate textual representations.**
