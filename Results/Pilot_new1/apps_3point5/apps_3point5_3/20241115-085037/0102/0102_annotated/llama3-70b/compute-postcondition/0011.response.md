Postcondition: ***s is an input integer where 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If 10 ≤ s < 20, the code prints the string representation of the number corresponding to s in the teens list. If 20 ≤ s ≤ 99, the code prints the concatenated string representation of the number based on the input s, considering both the tens and ones places. The program handles all edge cases within the specified range of s.***
