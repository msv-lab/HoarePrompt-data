The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function also utilizes two lists: `ones`, which contains string representations of numbers from zero to nine, and `teens`, which contains string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen. 

After executing the function body, if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the list `ones`. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the list `teens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the list `tens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in words by combining the string representation of the tens place with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place from the lists `tens` and `ones`, respectively. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the correct string representation of `n` based on the conditions mentioned above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and returns the corresponding string representation of n based on predefined conditions.**
