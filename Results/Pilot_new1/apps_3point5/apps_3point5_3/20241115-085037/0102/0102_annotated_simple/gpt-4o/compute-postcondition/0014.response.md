Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of 'n'. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of 'n' in words, with the tens place followed by a hyphen and then the ones place. The postcondition covers all edge cases, including when n is a multiple of 10 or when it is not, ensuring the correct string representation is returned.***
