Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 10 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 20, the code prints the string representation of the number in the `teens` list corresponding to the value of `s`. If s is equal to or greater than 20, the code prints the string representation of the number in the `tens` list corresponding to the tens place of `s`, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number in the `ones` list corresponding to the ones place of `s` if the ones place is not zero.***
