The function `func` takes user input as an integer `s` and prints out the corresponding English word representation of that number. It handles numbers from 0 to 99 inclusively. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the `teens` list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it prints the word representation by combining the tens and ones place values. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
