Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer where 10 <= s <= 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens place values. If s < 20, the code prints the string representation of the input integer `s` from the `teens` list. If 20 <= s <= 99, the code prints the string representation of the tens place value from the `tens` list concatenated with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place value from the `ones` list, unless the ones place value is 0, in which case only the tens place value is printed. The program successfully handles all boundary cases and provides the correct output based on the input integer `s`.***
