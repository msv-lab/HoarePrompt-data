The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The function also utilizes a list `tens` containing strings representing tens places from 0 to 90. 

The function has multiple return cases:
1. If 0 ≤ s ≤ 9, the function returns the string at index 's' in the list 'ones'.
2. If 11 ≤ s ≤ 19, the function returns the string at index (s - 10) from the list 'teens'.
3. If 10 ≤ s ≤ 99 and s is not between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the 'tens' list if `s` is divisible by 10.
4. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the 'tens' list with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the specified range and return the appropriate string representation based on the conditions described above.
