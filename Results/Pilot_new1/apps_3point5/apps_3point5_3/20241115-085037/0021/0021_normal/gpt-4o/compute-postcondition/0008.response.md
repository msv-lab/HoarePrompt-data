Example Answer:
The `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. 
- `dist1` is n-1, 
- `dist2` is 0, 
- `dist3` is 0, 
- `dist4` is the absolute difference between n-1 and min_pos. 
Since `min_pos` is 0, `dist4` is n-1. 
Therefore, the maximum value among these is n-1. 
Hence, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer, 
`a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, 
`min_pos` is 0, 
`max_pos` is n-1, 
`dist1` is n-1, 
`dist2` is 0, 
`dist3` is 0, 
`dist4` is n-1, 
and `max_distance` is n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is n-1, and `max_distance` is n-1**
