Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input `n` and a list of `n` integers as `a`.
- It correctly calculates the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (`n`) in the list.
- It then calculates the maximum distance of each element from the ends (0 and `n-1`) and prints the maximum distance.
- The code handles the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the list and no swap is needed.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
