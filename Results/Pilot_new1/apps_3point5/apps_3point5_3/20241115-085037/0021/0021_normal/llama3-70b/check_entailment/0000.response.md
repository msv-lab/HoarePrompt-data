Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` representing the size of the permutation and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`.
- It then finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the list.
- It calculates the maximum distance between these two elements by finding the absolute difference between their positions and subtracting 1.
- It also calculates the minimum distance between these two elements.
- Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1` minus the minimum distance.

The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality. There are no edge cases identified where the code would not work as expected.
