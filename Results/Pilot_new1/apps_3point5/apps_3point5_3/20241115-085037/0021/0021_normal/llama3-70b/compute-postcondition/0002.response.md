Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. Since each integer in the list `a` is distinct and between 1 and n inclusive, the index of 1 in the list `a` is the position of 1 in the list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`**
