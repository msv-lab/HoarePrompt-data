Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered as input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The number of elements in the list `a` is equal to `n`, which is an input integer. Each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and n inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive**
