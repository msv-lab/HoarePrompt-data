Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a` using the `index` method. The value of `n` is the maximum integer in the list `a`, so `posn` will be the index of the maximum integer in the list `a`. The states of `n`, `a`, and `pos1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`**
