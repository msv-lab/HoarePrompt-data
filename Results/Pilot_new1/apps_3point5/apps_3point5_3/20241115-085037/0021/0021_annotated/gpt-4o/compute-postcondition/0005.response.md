Example Answer: 
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between the value of `n` minus 1 and the value of `max_pos`. The values of `n` and `max_pos` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `dist2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
