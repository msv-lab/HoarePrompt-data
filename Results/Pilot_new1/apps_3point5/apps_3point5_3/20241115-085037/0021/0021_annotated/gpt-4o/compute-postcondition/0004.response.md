Example Answer:
The variable `dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and the value of `max_pos`. The previous values of `max_pos` and `dist1` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
