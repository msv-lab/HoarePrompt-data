Example Answer:
`max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not provided, so the output state is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
