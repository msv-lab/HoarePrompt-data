Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list `a`. If there is no 1 in the list, an error will occur. The state of the list `a` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers**
