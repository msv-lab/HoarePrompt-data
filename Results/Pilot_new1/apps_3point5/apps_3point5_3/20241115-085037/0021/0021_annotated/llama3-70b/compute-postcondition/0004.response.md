Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The values of `pos1` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `max_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
