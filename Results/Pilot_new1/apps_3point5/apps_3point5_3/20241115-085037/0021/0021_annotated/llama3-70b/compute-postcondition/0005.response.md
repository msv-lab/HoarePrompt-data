Example Answer: 
The minimum distance is calculated as the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `min_dist` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
