Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and prints the result. The previous values of `max_dist`, `n`, and `min_dist` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
