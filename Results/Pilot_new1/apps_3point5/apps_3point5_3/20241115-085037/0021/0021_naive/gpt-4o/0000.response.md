Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum positions in the array and calculates the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. It then calculates all possible distances based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and returns the maximum distance. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
