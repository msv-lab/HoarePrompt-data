Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, where `n` is the input integer, `min_pos` is 0. The value of `n` and `min_pos` are known, so the calculation results in the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `0`, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1**
