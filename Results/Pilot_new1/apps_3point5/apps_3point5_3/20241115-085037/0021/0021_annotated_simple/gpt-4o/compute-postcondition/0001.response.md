Example Answer:
The list `a` is reassigned to the list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers, forming a new list `a`. The previous values of `n` and the elements in the list `a` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
