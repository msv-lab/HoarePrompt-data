Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the maximum value in list `a`, which is n. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of n in list `a` is n-1. Therefore, `max_pos` is assigned the value of n-1. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1**
