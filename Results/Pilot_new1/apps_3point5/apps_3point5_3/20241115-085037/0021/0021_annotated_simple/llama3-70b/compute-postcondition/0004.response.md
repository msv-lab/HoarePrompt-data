Example Answer:
The maximum distance between pos1 and posn is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the indices and subtracting 1. If the indices are adjacent, the distance will be 0. Otherwise, it will be the number of elements between them minus 1. The output state is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance**
