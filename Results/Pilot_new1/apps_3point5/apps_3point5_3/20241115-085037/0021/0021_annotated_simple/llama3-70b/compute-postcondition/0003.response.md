Example Answer:
posn is assigned the index of n in list a using the index() method. The value of n is between 2 and 100, and a is a list of n distinct integers, so posn will be the index of n in list a. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a**
