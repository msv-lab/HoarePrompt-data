Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N, max_divisor is assigned the value of gcd. If gcd is divisible by i without any remainder, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between its current value and gcd divided by i.***
