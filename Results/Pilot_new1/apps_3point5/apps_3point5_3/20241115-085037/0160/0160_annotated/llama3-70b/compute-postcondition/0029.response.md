According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, `i` is `N`. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N + 1**
