According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, N is an integer between 2 and 500, so it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, since the loop starts from 1, the value of i should be adjusted to 1 at the beginning of the loop. 
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input split, gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, i is 1**
