Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd` divided by `i`, where `i` is `N - 1`. The `gcd` is calculated from elements in list `A`, and `max_divisor` is initially assigned the value of `gcd`. Therefore, the output state is: N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N - 1, and max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by N - 1.
Output State: **N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N - 1, and max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by N - 1**
