According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be one more than its current value. 
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x up to x, x is greater than or equal to 1, i is adjusted to be one more than its current value**
