Output State: **If x is 1, the loop will not execute as int(math.sqrt(1)) + 1 is 2 and the range will be (1, 2) which does not include 1. In this case, divisors will remain an empty set. If x is greater than 1, the loop will execute and divisors will contain all the divisors of x, including 1 and x itself.**
