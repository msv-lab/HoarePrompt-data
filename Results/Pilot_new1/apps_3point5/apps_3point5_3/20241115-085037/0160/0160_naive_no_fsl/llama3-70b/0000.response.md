Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates over the divisors of the gcd and finds the maximum divisor that satisfies the condition. The logic seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
