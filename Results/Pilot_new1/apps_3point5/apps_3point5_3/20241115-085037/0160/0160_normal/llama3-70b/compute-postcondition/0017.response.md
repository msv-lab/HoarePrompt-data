Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A` where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is N, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of the maximum between `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, and the gcd of all elements in list `A` is divisible by `i`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
