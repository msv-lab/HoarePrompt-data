Output State: **`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. If N is less than 2, `gcd` remains the same as the initial value. `i` is N if the loop executes. If `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If the loop does not execute, then `max_divisor` remains the same as the initial value. The code snippet prints the value of `max_divisor`.**
