Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The values in the list `A` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^6. The length of the list `A` can be between 2 and 500. The variable `K` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`A` is a list of N integers where 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9**
