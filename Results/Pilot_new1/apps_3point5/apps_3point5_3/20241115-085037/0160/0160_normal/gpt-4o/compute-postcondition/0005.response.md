Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The set `divisors` is updated by adding both `i` and `x // i` for each `i` that satisfies the condition x % i == 0.***
