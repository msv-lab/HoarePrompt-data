Example Answer: 
The value `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x // i` will be an integer. Therefore, the new set `divisors` will contain all the previous divisors along with the new one, `x // i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
