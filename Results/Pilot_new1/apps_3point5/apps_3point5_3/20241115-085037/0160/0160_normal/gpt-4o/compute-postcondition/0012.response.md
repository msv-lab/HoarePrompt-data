Example Answer:
The code snippet adds `x // i` to the set `divisors`, which already contains all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`. The set `divisors` is updated to include this new divisor. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i`, `x // i`, `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`, as well as `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i`, `x // i`, `int(math.sqrt(x))`, `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x // i`**
