According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. In this case, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Add `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))` to the set `divisors`.**
