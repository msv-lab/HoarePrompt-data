Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of integers and find the divisors of a given integer, respectively.
- The main part of the code reads the input, calculates the sum of the list `A`, calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements in `A`, finds the divisors of the sum of `A`, and then iterates through the divisors to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.
- The code handles the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the range of N, the range of A_i, and the range of K.
- The code logic seems to correctly find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations based on the provided problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality and do not indicate any potential cases where the code might fail to meet the requirements.
