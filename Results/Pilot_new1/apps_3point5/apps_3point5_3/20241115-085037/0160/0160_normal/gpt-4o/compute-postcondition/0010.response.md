According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `divisors` includes `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is updated to include `i` and `x // i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to include the next positive integer `i+1` in the range of `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `divisors` includes `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is updated to include `i` and `x // i`, and `i+1` is the next positive integer in the range of `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.**
