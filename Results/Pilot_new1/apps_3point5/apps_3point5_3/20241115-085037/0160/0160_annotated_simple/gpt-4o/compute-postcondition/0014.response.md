According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current square root of `x`, and the set `divisors` should be updated with the newly added divisor based on the condition `x % i == 0` in the if statement.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` is the next integer after the current square root of `x`.**
