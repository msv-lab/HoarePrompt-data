Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers. This is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. The `func_2` function correctly finds all the divisors of a given positive integer x and returns them in descending order. This is necessary for determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
3. Both functions are implemented correctly and fulfill the requirements of the problem description. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
