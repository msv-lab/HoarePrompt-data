Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated using the `math.gcd` function with the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`. The previous values of `gcd` and `i` are known, so the new value of `gcd` will be the greatest common divisor of the previous `gcd` and `A[i]`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), `gcd` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), `gcd` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is incremented by 1**
