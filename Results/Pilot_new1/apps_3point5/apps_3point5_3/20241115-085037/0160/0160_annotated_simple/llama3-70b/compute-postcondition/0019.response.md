According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gcd`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `gcd`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers. If `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `max_divisor` needs to be updated based on the conditions mentioned above.

State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions**.
