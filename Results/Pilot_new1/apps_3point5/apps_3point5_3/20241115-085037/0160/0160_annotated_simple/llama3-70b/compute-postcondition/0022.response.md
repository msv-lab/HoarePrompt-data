Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of dividing gcd by i. In all cases, the variables maintain their integer values with appropriate adjustments based on the conditions of the if statement.***
