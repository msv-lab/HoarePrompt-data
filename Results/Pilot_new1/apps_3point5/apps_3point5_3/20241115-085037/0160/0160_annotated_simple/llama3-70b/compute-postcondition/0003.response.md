According to the code, the loop will execute for values of N greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, the values of N, K, A_i, gcd, and i need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, i is 1**
