Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes the input, processes it, and outputs "YES" if there is an interval with the prescribed color counts, and "NO" if there is none. The program uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the current counts of each color and compares it with the desired counts. It iterates through the colors list and adjusts the window accordingly. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
