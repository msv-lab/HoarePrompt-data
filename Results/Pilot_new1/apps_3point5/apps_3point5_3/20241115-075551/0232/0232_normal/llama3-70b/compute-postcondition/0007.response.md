Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is not empty, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input. If the color is not present in `color_counts`, the color is added to `color_counts` with a count of 0. In all other cases, the state of the program remains unchanged and no modifications are made to `color_counts`.***
