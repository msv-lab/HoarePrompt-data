Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, colors is non-empty, color_counts is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0. window_counts[color] is incremented by 1. The variable found remains True if all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting. If the condition in the if statement is met, found is set to True and the loop breaks. All edge cases, including the initial state of variables and handling missing colors in window_counts, are accounted for in the postcondition.***
