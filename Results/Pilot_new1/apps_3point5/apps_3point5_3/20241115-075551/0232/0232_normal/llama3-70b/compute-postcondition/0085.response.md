Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, then all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts` after sorting. The loop breaks after this condition is met or j reaches n. If color is not in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if colors is an empty list or if n is less than or equal to i. This ensures that the program continues to iterate over colors until the matching condition is met or the end of the loop is reached, handling all possible cases effectively.***
