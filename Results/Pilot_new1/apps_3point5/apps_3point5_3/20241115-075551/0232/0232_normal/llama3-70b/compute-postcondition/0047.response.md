Postcondition: ***`n` is still greater than 0, `colors` remains non-empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, `found` remains True, `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color` incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial conditions and relationships, ensuring the integrity of the program state after the execution of the if statement.***
