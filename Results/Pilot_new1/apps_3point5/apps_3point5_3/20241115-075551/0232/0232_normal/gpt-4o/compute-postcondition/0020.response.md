According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` and `right` are updated, `left` remains the same, and `desired_counts` unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` and `right` are updated, `left` remains the same, `desired_counts` unchanged, `right` is less than `n`**
