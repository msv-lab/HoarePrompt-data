Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in `colors` is incremented by 1 in `current_counts`. The loop continues until `right` is less than `n`, and `right` is increased by 1. The values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are affected, while `desired_counts` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **current_counts and right are updated, left remains the same, desired_counts unchanged**
