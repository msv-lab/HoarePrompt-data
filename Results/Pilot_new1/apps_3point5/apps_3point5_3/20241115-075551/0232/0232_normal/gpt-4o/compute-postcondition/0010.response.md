Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0. If all colors in desired_counts have their counts matching the counts in current_counts, the function returns 'YES'. In all other cases, the function does not return 'YES'.***
