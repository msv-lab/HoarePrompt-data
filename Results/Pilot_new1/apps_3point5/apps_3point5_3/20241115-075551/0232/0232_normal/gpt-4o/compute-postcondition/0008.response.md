According to the code, the loop can execute again if all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the `current_counts`. At the end of the previous iteration, the condition was already satisfied for the loop to continue. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, desired_counts is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, current_counts is a defaultdict with default value 0**
