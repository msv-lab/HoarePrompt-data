Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the input is not provided, the specific values of `n` and `m` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum(counts) <= n.**
