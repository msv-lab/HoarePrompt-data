Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values, processes the data, and determines if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It iterates through all possible contiguous intervals and checks if the color counts match the desired counts. The logic for updating the color counts and checking for a match is implemented correctly. The program prints "YES" if such an interval exists and "NO" otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description.
