Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is assigned 0, where `color` is the first color in the `colors` list. Therefore, the count of the first color in the `colors` list is set to 0 in the `color_counts` dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the first color `color` added as a key and its count as value, `color` is the first color in the `colors` list, the count of the first color in the `colors` list is 0**
