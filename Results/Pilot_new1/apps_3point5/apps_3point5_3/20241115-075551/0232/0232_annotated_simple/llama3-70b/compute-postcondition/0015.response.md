Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers. `color_counts` is a dictionary where the third color in the list is added as a key if it's not already present, and its count is set to 0. If the third color is already in `color_counts`, its count remains unchanged.***
