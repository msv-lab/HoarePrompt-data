Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts` at the index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are unknown, so the output state is: Updated values in `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **Updated values in `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` to reflect the next iteration of the loop**
