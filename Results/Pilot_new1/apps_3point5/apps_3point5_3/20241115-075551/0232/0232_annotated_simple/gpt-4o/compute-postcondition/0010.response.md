Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything. The program handles all possible cases where the values in `current_counts` do not match the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for each color, ensuring the correct output based on the comparison.***
