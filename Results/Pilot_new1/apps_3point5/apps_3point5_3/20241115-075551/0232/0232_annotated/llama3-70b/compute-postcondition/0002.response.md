Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts`. After execution, the values in the list `counts` are updated. The sum of all counts should be between 1 and `n` inclusive. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an input integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of integers representing the colors of lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, and updated `counts` list with desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
