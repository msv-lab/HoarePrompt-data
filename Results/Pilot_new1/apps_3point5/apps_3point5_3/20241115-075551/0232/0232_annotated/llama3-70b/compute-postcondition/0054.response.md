Example Answer:
A dictionary named `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `found` remains False, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values and relationships.
Output State: **`found` is False, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
