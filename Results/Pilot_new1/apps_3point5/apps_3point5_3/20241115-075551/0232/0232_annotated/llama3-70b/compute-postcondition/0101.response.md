Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all color counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` list. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0.***
