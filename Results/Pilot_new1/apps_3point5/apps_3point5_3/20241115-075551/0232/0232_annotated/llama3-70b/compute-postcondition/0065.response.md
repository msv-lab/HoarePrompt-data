According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`found` is a boolean variable, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color is properly updated**
