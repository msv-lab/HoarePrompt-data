Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all counts of colors in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts in `counts` after sorting, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color is properly updated. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False and the loop continues.***
