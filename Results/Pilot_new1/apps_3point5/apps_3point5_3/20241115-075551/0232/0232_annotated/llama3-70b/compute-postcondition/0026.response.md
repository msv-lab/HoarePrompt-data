Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not in the keys of `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. This condition covers all cases where the color is not present in the window_counts dictionary, ensuring that it is initialized to 0.***
