Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the output is n. If n is not divisible by 10, if n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output is n without the last digit. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the output is n with the last digit replaced by the next multiple of 10.***
