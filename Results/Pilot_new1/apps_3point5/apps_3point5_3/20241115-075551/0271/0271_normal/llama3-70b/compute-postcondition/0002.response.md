Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer divisible by 10. Since the value of `n` can be any number that meets the given conditions, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is divisible by 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is divisible by 10**
