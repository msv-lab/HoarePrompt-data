Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it checks the last digit of `n`. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` without the last digit. If the last digit is greater than 5, it prints `n` with the last digit replaced by the next multiple of 10. The function does not have any specified return value.**
