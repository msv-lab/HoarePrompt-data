Example Answer:
The code prints `n - n % 10`, which means it prints the value of `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the result will be a number that is a multiple of 10 and less than `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5**
