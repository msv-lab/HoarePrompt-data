Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It handles the scenario where the input number `n` is already divisible by 10 and prints `n` as is. It also covers the cases where `n` is not divisible by 10 and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and confirm that it covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the output produced by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
