Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is divisible by 10, the program prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the program prints `n` with the units digit removed if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. Otherwise, the program prints `n` incremented to the nearest multiple of 10. This postcondition encompasses all possible scenarios and outcomes of the given program fragment.***
