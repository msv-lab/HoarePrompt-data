Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9 and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5, the value of `result` will vary based on the specific values of `n` and `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5, and `result` is the result of n - remainder.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5, and `result` is the result of n - remainder**
