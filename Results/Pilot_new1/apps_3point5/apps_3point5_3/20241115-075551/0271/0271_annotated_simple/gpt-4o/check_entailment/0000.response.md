Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer input 'n' and calculates the remainder when divided by 10. Based on the value of the remainder, it rounds 'n' to the nearest integer ending with 0. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from 'n' to get the result. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds (10 - remainder) to 'n' to get the result.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description provided. For any non-negative integer input 'n', the program correctly rounds it to the nearest integer ending with 0. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
