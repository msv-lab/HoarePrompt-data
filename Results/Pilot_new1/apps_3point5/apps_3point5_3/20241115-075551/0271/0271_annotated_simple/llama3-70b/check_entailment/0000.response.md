Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases for the input value 'n' within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). If 'n' is already divisible by 10, it prints 'n'. If the last digit of 'n' is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the last digit. If the last digit of 'n' is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference between 10 and the last digit. Since the program covers all scenarios and produces the correct output for each case, it is considered correct.
