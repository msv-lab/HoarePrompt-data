Example Answer:
Since `n` is a non-negative integer divisible by 10, the value of `n` will be printed. The output state will remain the same as the initial state with the value of `n` being printed.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and divisible by 10, and the value of n is printed**
