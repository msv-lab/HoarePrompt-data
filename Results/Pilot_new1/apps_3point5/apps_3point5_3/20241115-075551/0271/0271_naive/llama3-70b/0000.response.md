Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem statement. It checks if the number is already ending with 0, and if so, prints the number itself. Otherwise, it determines the closest multiple of 10 by subtracting or adding the appropriate value based on the last digit of the number. The logic covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, and the program will provide the correct output for any valid input within the specified range.
