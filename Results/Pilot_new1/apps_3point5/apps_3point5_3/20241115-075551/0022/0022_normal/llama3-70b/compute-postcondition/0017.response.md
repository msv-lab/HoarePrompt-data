Output State: **`s` is the input string provided by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is a boolean variable. The loop checks if the characters at corresponding positions in the string are equal, updating `is_spalindrome` to False if a mismatch is found and breaking out of the loop. The loop will not execute if the input string is empty or has a length of 1, in which case `is_spalindrome` remains True.**
