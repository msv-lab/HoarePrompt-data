Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is the length of `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is a boolean variable. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. The program handles all cases where the characters at the corresponding indexes are not equal, updating `is_spalindrome` accordingly.***
