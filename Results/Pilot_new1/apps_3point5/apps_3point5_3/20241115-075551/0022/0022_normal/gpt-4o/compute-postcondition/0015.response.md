Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It then iterates through the string to check if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end towards the middle. If any pair of characters does not match, it returns False. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True. The function handles both odd and even-length strings correctly, ensuring that it accurately determines if the input string is a palindrome or not.**
