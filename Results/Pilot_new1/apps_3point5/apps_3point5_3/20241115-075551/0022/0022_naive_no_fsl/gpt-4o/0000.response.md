Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the input string is symmetric about the middle. It then reads the input string, calls the `func_1` function, and prints "TAK" if the string is symmetric and "NIE" otherwise. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly compares the characters from the beginning and end of the string to determine if it is a symmetric palindrome. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
