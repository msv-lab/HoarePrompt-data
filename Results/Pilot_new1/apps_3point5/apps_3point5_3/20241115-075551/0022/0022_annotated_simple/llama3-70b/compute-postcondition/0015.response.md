Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This covers the case where the palindrome property is violated at index `i` in the string.***
