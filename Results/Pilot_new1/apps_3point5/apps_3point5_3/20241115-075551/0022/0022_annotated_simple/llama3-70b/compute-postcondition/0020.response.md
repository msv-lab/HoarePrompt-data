Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input, checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric indices, and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, otherwise 'NIE'. The function assumes the input string consists of English letters and has a length greater than or equal to 2. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
