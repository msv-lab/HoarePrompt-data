Output State: **If `n` is at least 2 and `s` is a non-empty string, the loop checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric indices. If a mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2 or `s` is an empty string. Then it prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, otherwise it prints 'NIE'.**
