The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters. The function also accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 1000, and an integer `i` which is at most `n // 2 - 1`. 

Case_1: The function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]` at any point during the loop, the function returns False. If the loop completes without encountering any unequal characters, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.

Case_2: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s`, check if it is a palindrome, and return True if it is a palindrome. If `n` is less than 2, it returns False.
