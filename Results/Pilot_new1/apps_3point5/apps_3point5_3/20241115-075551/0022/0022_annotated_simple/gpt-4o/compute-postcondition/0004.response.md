Postcondition: ***s is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 0. If the character at index i in string s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the program returns False. This condition covers all possible scenarios where the characters at the specified indices do not match, leading to the function returning False.***
