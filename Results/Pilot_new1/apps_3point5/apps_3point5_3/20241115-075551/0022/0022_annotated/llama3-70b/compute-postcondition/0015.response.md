Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This indicates that the string `s` is not a palindrome.***
