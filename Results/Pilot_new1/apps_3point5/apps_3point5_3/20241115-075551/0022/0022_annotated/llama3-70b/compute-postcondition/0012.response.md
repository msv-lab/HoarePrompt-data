According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 - 1` to meet the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1**
