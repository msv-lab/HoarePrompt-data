According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, and `is_spalindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i` < `n // 2` must still hold true. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 4.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5, `is_spalindrome` is True**
