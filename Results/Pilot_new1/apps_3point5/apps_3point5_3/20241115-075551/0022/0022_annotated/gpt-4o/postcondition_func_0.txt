The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and checks if all characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in the string `s` are equal for all `i` from 0 to `(n // 2) - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. If any pair of characters is not equal, it returns False. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, it returns True.
