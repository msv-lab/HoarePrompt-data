The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. The function then checks if the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in the string `s` are equal for all `i` from 0 to `(n // 2) - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns False. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True if all characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in the string `s` are equal for all `i` from 0 to `(n // 2) - 1`. If any pair of characters is not equal, it returns False. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, it returns True.
