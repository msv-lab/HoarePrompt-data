Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `(n // 2) - 2`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, ensuring the integrity of the string `s` is maintained.***
