Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with `sub` according to the function `is_valid_number`, then `candidate` is yielded. This ensures that the program yields valid candidates based on the given conditions.***
