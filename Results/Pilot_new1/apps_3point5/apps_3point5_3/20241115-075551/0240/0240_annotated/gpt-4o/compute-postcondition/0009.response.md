According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more permutations available for `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `perm` should be the next permutation of `chars` and `candidate` should pass the validation check with `sub` according to the function `is_valid_number`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`.**
