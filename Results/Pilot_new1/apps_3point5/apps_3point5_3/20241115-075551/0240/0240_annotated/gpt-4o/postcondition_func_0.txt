The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the characters in `sub`. Then, it generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters and `sub`. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle cases where `sub_counter` is empty, potentially leading to unexpected results.
