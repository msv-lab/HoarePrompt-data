Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function iterates through each character in the input string `s` and appends it to the result `n` only if it is present in the substring `t`. Then, it appends the substring `t` to `n` and returns the resulting integer value.

The code annotations also accurately describe the behavior of the program, detailing the state of the variables after the for loop has been executed and explaining the logic behind the function.

Since the program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations align with the code's functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct.
