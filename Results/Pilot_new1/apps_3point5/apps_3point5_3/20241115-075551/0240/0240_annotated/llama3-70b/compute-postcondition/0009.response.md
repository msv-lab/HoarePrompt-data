According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the set `t_set`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the first character removed. If the first character of the original `s` was in `t_set`, `n` should be updated to include this character. If the first character of the original `s` was not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` should not be empty.
State: **`s` is not empty, `n` may or may not be updated based on the removed first character of the original `s`**
