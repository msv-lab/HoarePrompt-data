Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated to include the character `c`. The character `c` is the next character in `s` after removing the first character, and it is in `t_set`. Therefore, `n` is updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` is updated to remove the first character, if the next character in `s` is in `t_set`; `n` is updated to include this character**
