According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in `s`. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, so it meets the condition for the loop to execute. `t` is a substring of `s`, so it does not affect the loop execution. `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, which also does not affect the loop execution. `n` being an empty string does not impact the loop execution either. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `c`, which will be the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character in `s`**
