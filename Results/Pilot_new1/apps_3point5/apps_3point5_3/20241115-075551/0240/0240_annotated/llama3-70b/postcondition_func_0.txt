The function func_1 accepts two parameters, s and t, where s is a string of digits and t is a substring of s. It iterates through each character in s and if the character is in t, it appends it to n. Finally, it concatenates t to n and returns the integer value of the resulting string. If t is an empty string, the function returns the integer value of s. If s is empty or none of its characters are in t, the function returns 0.
