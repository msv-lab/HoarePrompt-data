Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated by adding the value of `c`. The value of `c` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `n` after the update cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is not empty, `n` may or may not be updated based on the removed first character of the original `s`.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `n` may or may not be updated based on the removed first character of the original `s`**
