Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, `n` is updated to include the characters of `t` (if `t` is not empty), `c` is the current character in `s`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to include `c`. If `t` is an empty string, `n` remains an empty string. If `s` is an empty string or none of the characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged.**
