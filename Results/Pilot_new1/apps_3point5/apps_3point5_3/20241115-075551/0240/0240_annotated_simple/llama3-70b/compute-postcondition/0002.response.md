According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in the string `s`**
