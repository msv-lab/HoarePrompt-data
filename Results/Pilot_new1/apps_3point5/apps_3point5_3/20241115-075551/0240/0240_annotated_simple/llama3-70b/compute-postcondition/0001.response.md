Example Answer: 
Variable `n` is assigned an empty string `''`, which does not affect the state of the set `t_set` containing unique digit characters present in string `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`.
Output State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`**
