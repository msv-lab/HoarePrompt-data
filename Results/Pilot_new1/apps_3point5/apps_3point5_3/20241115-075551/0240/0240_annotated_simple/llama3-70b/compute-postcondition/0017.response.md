Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It creates a set `t_set` from the characters in `t`. Then, it iterates through each character in `s` and if the character is present in `t_set`, it appends it to the string `n`. After that, it concatenates the string `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. The function assumes that both `s` and `t` are strings containing only digits, and `t` can contain leading zeroes. If `s` is empty or none of its characters are in `t_set`, the function returns 0.**
