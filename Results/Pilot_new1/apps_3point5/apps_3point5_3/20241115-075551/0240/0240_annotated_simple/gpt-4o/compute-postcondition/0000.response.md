According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `chars`. If `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `chars` has at least 2 elements. Additionally, since it's the start of the loop, the `perm` should be the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
