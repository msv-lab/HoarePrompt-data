Postcondition: ***`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`.***
