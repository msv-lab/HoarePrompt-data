Correctness: **True**

The program defines three functions to solve the problem of finding the smallest possible initial integer n given a string and a substring. The functions work together to generate all possible numbers by permuting the characters in the string, validate those numbers based on the provided substring, and return the smallest valid number.

The logic in the functions seems correct as it appropriately handles the situation where the substring is present in the generated numbers and the length of the number is correct. The use of Counter to handle character counts and permutations to generate possible numbers is a valid approach to solve the problem.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, it seems like the program is correctly implemented and should work for all potential cases.
