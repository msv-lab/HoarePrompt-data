Postcondition: ***`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub), then the function yields `candidate`.***
