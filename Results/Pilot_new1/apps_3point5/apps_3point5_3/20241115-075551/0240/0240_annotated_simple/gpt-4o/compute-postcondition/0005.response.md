According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of the characters in `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of the characters in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation needs to be generated. Therefore, the `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` should represent this new permutation. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
