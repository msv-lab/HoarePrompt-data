According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is another permutation of the characters in `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` should be generated. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `perm` should be the next permutation after the current `perm`, and `candidate` should represent the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
