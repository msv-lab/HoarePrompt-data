The function func_1 accepts two string parameters, s and sub, both containing digits. It subtracts the count of common characters in s by the count of those characters in sub. If sub contains characters not present in s, those characters are ignored. Then, it generates possible numbers from the remaining characters in s after subtraction. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers.
