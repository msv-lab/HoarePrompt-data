The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub. It returns True if the substring sub is present in num_str and the length of num_str is equal to n_len. Otherwise, it returns False. However, the code snippet provided is missing the definition of n_len, which may lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior if n_len is not defined elsewhere in the code.
