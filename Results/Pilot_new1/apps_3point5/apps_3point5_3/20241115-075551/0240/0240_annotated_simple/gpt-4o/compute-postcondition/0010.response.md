Example Answer:
The `candidate` string is created by joining the elements of the `perm` list. The `perm` list represents the next permutation after the current `perm`. Therefore, the `candidate` string represents the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
