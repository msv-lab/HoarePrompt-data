Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the current `candidate` string. The variables `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged. The function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` is not called in this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, and the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub) returns true.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, and the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub) returns true**
