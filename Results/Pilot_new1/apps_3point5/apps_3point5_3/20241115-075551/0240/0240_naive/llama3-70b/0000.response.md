Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the substring t contains leading zeroes. This will result in the incorrect output as the program simply concatenates the substring t to the end of the reconstructed number n without considering leading zeroes. 

For example:
Input:
```
003512
021
```
Output:
```
30021
```
Expected Output:
```
300021
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the case of leading zeroes in the substring t.
