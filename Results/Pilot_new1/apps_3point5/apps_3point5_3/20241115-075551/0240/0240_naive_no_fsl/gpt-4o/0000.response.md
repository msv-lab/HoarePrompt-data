Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input string contains leading zeros. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except when the integer n was equal to zero itself. The program does not account for this condition and may produce incorrect results when there are leading zeros in the input string.
