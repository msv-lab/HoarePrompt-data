According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no output. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated and checked if it forms a valid number with `sub`.
State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub**`.
