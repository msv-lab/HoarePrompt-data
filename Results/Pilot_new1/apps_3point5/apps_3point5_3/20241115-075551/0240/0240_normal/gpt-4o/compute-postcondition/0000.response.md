According to the code, the loop can execute if the `chars` string contains at least one digit. The loop uses the permutations of the characters in `chars`, so if `chars` has no characters, the loop won't execute. Additionally, `sub` being a substring of `n` does not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `chars` string must contain at least one digit.
State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`**
