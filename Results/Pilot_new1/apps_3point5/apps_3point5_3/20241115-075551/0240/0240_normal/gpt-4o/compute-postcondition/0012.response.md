Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`.***
