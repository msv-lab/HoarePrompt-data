According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more permutations of `chars` to explore. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. 

State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`.**
