Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. The previous values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`**
