Output State: 

- If `chars` is a string with at least one digit and `sub` is a substring of `n`, the loop will generate permutations of `chars`, join them to form `candidate`, and check if `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, the loop will yield `candidate`.
- If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a substring of `n`, the loop will not execute, and there will be no changes to the variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate`.
- If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` never evaluates to true for any generated `candidate`, there will be no output after the loop finishes.
