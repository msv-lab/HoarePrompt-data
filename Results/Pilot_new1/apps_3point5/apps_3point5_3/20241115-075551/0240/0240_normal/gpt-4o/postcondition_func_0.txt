The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub, where s has a greater length than sub. It then updates the character counts in s_counter by subtracting the counts in sub_counter. After that, it generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters in s_counter and sub, finds the smallest number from the list of possible numbers, and returns it.
