Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The condition x <= y + z still holds true, x is not less than y. If x is equal to y and z is 0, the code prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, the code prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the code prints '?'.***
