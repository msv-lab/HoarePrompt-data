Example Answer:
The values of x, y, and z are assigned based on the input split by spaces. Since the values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state is: x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
