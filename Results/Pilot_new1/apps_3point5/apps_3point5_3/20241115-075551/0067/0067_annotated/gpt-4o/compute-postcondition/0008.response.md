Postcondition: ***`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false.***
