Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. Since the values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
