Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It checks the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints the appropriate symbol ('+', '-', '0', or '?') based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The code covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that the code is correctly following the problem requirements. Hence, the code is correct.
