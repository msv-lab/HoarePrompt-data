Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100**
