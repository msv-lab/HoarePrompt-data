To analyze the output state of the while loop given the initial state and the loop operation, we can deduce the final conditions based on how the loop operates.

The code of the loop:
```
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```

1. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero. 
2. In each iteration, the current value of `b` is assigned to `a`, and the value of `a % b` is assigned to `b`.

Given that `0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9` (which are positive integers) and the range for `b_1, b_2, L, R` does not restrict `b` from being initially zero or non-zero, we can derive the following:

- **Before the loop:** `b` must be non-zero for the loop to execute at all.
- **After the loop finishes:** The loop performs what is known as the Euclidean algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_1` and `b`. 

The final values will be such that:
- `b` will eventually become `0`, indicating that the GCD has been found.
- `a` will hold the last non-zero value of `b`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b`.

Now, I will summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop. 

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b` (where `b` is the initial value before the loop started).**
