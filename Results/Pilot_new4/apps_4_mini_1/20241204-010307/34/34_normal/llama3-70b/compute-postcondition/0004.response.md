According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the variable `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `b` is non-zero. This means that the loop can execute again without requiring any state adjustments. 

State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` is non-zero, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`**
