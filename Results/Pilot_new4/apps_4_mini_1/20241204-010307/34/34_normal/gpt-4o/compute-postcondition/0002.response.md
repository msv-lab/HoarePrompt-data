The variable `x` is incremented by the product of `k` and `a2_div_gcd`. Here, `k` is defined as `(L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`. Since `k` is calculated based on the given values of `L`, `b1`, `a1`, `x`, and `a1_div_gcd`, the updated value of `x` will depend on these calculations. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers; current value of `sign_a1` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned the value of (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd); `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`.**
