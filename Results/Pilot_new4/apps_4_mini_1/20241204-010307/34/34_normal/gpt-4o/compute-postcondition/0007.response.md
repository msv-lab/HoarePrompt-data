The variable `y` is decremented by `k * a1_div_gcd`. The value of `k` is previously calculated as `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`. The initial state indicates that `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers and that `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0, which may imply that `a1_div_gcd` is non-positive or zero. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0; `k` is calculated as (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd); `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`; `y` is updated to `y - (k * a1_div_gcd)`.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0; `k` is calculated as (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd); `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`; `y` is updated to `y - (k * a1_div_gcd)`**.
