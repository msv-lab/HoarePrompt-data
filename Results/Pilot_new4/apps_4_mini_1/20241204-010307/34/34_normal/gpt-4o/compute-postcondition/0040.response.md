Postcondition: ***`a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9. If `val` is greater than `R`, then the values of `x0` and `y0` are updated with `x0` incremented by `a2_div_gcd` and `y0` decremented by `a1_div_gcd`, while `val` is calculated as `a1 * x0 + b1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
