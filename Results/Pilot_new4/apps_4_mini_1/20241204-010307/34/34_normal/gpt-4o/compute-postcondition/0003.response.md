The variable `y` is updated by subtracting `k * a1_div_gcd`. The value of `k` is already determined as (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers; current value of `sign_a1` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned the value of (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd); `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd; `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd.**
