You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1, a_2 are positive integers such that 0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9; b_1, b_2, L, R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9 and L ≤ R.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns b, which is an integer in the range -2·10^9 ≤ b ≤ 2·10^9, along with the values 0 and 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a_1`, `a_2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R` ≤ 2·10^9 and `L` ≤ `R`; `a` is a non-zero integer.
    gcd, x1, y1 = func_1(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1

    #The program returns gcd, x, and y, where gcd is the greatest common divisor calculated from func_1(b % a, a), x is calculated as y1 - (b // a) * x1, and y is equal to x1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `a` and an integer `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, along with coefficients `x` and `y` that satisfy `gcd(a, b) = a * x + b * y`. The case where `a` is `0` is not applicable based on the provided constraints.

    if (B < 0) :
        y0 = -y0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `A` = `a1`; `B` = -`a2`; `C` = `b2` - `b1`; `gcd`, `x0`, are assigned the values returned by `func_1(abs(A), abs(B))`; `C` is divisible by `gcd`; if `B` is less than 0, then `y0` is negated. Otherwise, the values of the program variables remain unchanged.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x0` has been incremented by `n * a2_div_gcd`, where `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `y0` has been decremented by `n * a1_div_gcd`, `count` contains the count of all valid `val` values that were within the range defined by `L` and `R`, and `val` is the last calculated value that exceeds `R`. `val` equals `a1 * x0 + b1`, indicating that the loop executed until the calculated value exceeded `R`, thus ensuring `val` was within the specified limits for `count` updates at least `n` times.
    return count
    #The program returns the count of all valid 'val' values that were within the range defined by 'L' and 'R', where 'val' is the last calculated value that exceeds 'R' and was updated at least 'n' times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six parameters: two positive integers `a1` and `a2`, two integers `b1` and `b2`, and two integers `L` and `R`. It first checks if the difference `b2 - b1` is divisible by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a1` and `-a2`. If not, it returns -1. If it is divisible, the function calculates a linear combination of `a1` and `a2` to count how many valid values of the form `a1 * x + b1` fall within the range `[L, R]`, incrementing `x` by `a2` and decrementing `y` by `a1` in each iteration. The function returns the count of such valid values. The code does not handle cases where `L` is greater than `R`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1 and a_2 are positive integers such that 0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9; b_1 and b_2 are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2 ≤ 2·10^9; L and R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 2·10^9.
def adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2):
    if (sign_a1 > 0) :
        k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)
        x += k * a2_div_gcd
        y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    else :
        k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)
        x += k * a2_div_gcd
        y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers. If `sign_a1` is greater than 0, then `k` is assigned the value of `(L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`, `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, and `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`. If `sign_a1` is less than or equal to 0, then `k` is calculated as `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`, `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, and `y` is updated to `y - (k * a1_div_gcd)`.
    if (b1 + a1 * x < L) :
        x += a2_div_gcd
        y -= a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers. If `b1 + a1 * x` is less than `L`, then `k` is assigned a value based on the condition of `sign_a1`, resulting in `x` being updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd` and `y` being updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`.
    if (b1 + a1 * x > R) :
        x -= a2_div_gcd
        y += a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers. If `b1 + a1 * x` is greater than `R`, then `y` is increased by `a1_div_gcd`. If `b1 + a1 * x` is less than or equal to `R`, then there are no changes made to `y`.
    return x, y
    #The program returns the values of x and y, where the value of y may have been increased by a1_div_gcd if b1 + a1 * x is greater than R, and if b1 + a1 * x is less than or equal to R, y remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, two positive integers `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd`, and two integers `sign_a1` and `sign_a2`. It adjusts the values of `x` and `y` based on conditions involving the bounds `L` and `R`, and the calculations involving `b1`, `a1`, and the signs. Specifically, it may increase or decrease `x` and adjust `y` depending on the results of these calculations. The final output is the modified values of `x` and `y`. Note that the function does not handle any cases where values might exceed the specified bounds in the comments, nor does it check if `a1_div_gcd` or `a2_div_gcd` are valid in the context of the operations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
