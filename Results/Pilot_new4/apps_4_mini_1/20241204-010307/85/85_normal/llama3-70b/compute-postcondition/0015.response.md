Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)) and counts how many integers `i` (ranging from 1 to \( n/2 \)) exist such that the sum of `i` and \( n - i \) is a multiple of \( 10^{(len(i + (n - i)) - 1)} \). It then prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result. **
