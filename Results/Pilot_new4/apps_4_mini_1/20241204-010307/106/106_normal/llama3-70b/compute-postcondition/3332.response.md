According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the knight's possible moves in chess. The loop will execute regardless of the initial state of `x`, `y`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece`, as the loop's execution depends only on the predefined list of moves. 

Thus, the loop will run for each of the 8 possible knight moves. However, since the loop body is omitted, there's no specific computation or change to the variables that would occur during the loop execution.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The critical states (like `x`, `y`, `cur`, and others) are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(x, y)` considering all valid knight's moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` can take values from the knight's moves list**
