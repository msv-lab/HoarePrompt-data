The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are constrained to be between 0 and `N-1`, while `N` is between 3 and 10, which means `nx` and `ny` will also be valid indices for accessing elements in a 2D array `A`. The values of `nx` and `ny` do not change, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
