The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. Given that `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, and that both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions of being greater than or equal to 0 and less than `N`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `nx` and `ny` in the context of the matrix `A`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
