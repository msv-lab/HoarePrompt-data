Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices and `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then the distance `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than this new value, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0) along with one additional tuple (ncur, 1). Otherwise, no changes occur in the distances or parent tracking.***
