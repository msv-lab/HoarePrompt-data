The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which refers to the element at the position `(nx, ny)` in the 2D list `A`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already confirmed to be within the bounds of the grid. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will include all unchanged variables and the updated value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `piece` is less than or equal to `n`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
