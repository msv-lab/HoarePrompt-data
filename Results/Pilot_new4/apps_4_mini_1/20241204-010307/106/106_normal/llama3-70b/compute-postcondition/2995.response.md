The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous value of `dist[0][cur]` is known, and since it is being incremented by 1, `dist[0][ncur]` will now reflect this updated value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
