The code assigns the values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The calculation is as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`. Since `dx` is -1, this means `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `dy` is 0, this means `ny` will remain equal to `y`, which is 0.

The initial state provides no specific value for `x`, so we can't determine the exact value of `nx`. However, we know the following:

- `N` is an integer in the range from 3 to 10. 
- `y` remains 0.
- `dx` is -1.
- `dy` is 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0.**
