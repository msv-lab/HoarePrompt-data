The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value being added to the `queue` reflects the current position and the piece type. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, with `parent[2][ncur]` assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
