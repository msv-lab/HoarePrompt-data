The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are given to be between 0 and N-1, and the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified but can be inferred as they are likely offsets applied to `x` and `y`. As a result, `nx` and `ny` will be adjusted according to the specific values of `dx` and `dy` added to `x` and `y`.

Since the loop has exhausted all tuples, it indicates that the current iteration is completing, and there are no further valid tuples to process. However, the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
