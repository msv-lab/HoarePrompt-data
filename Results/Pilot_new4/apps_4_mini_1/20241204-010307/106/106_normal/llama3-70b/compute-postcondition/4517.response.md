The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `N`, `y`, and the contents of `A` and `dist` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. The impact of the code is limited to updating `parent[1][ncur]`, which now holds the value of `cur` associated with a specific `piece`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
