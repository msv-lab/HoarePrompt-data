The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be one more than `dist[0][cur]`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this change will equalize those two values.

Let's denote the previous value of `dist[0][cur]` as `cur_value`, then the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be `cur_value + 1`.

Since no other variables are affected by this code, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The valid information includes the conditions surrounding `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the condition on `dist[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N` are satisfied, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
