Postcondition: ***If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples along with `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged. Additionally, `ncur` takes the value assigned from `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is in the range [0, N) and `ny` is in the range [0, N).***
