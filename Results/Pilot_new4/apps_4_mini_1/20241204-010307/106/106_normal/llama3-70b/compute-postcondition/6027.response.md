According to the code, the loop iterates over the possible directions represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have specific values. 

Currently, `y` is 9, which suggests that `dy` could take values from the direction tuples. The loop will execute for each of the four direction tuples. Since `y` is currently at its maximum of 9 (given `N` is greater than or equal to 9), this means that in the next iteration, the `dy` component of the tuple could be used to affect the `ny` value.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we will need to consider the `dx` and `dy` values. 

- When `dx = -1`, `ny` will not change.
- When `dx = 1`, `ny` will not change.
- When `dx = 0`, for `dy = -1`, `ny` will decrement by 1, resulting in 8.
- When `dx = 0`, for `dy = 1`, `ny` will increment by 1, which would exceed `N` (if `N` is exactly 9).

Since `y` is currently 9, the next value of `ny` must be less than 9 to allow for further iterations through the tuple, hence for future iterations, `ny` must be set to 8 as the maximum valid value.

Thus, the adjustments for the next iteration would be:

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 8, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and also includes `(ncur, 2)`**
