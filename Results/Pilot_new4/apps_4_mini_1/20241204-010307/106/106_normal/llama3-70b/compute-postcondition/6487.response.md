The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the queue, but other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of the variables remains valid after the execution, and only the `queue` variable is updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` with `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
