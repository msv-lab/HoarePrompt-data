The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[1][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value currently at `dist[1][cur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is derived from the values of `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`, we can express `ncur` in terms of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
