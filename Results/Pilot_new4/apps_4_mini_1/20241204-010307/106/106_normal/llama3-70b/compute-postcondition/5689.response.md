Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 2)` for each valid `(nx, ny)` position found where `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from `cur` to `ncur` for each valid position; `parent[2][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)` for each valid position; if no valid positions were found, `queue` remains unchanged, and `dist` and `parent` would not be updated for `ncur. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
