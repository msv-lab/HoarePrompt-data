To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the conditions provided.

1. The loop iterates over pairs `(dx, dy)`, which are offsets to the current values of `x` and `y`.

2. Each iteration of the loop will use different values of `dx` and `dy` from the list `[(−2, −1), (−2, 1), (−1, −2), (−1, 2), (1, −2), (1, 2), (2, −1), (2, 1)]`.

3. Since `x` is currently 1 and `y` is currently 2, we calculate `nx` and `ny` based on the current `dx` and `dy` values.

4. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `nx` and `ny` are updated to `1 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively.

5. The loop will execute one more time if there are more pairs `(dx, dy)` to iterate over. The current iteration index is determined by how many pairs have already been processed.

6. Given that the loop iterates over 8 pairs, and since `dx` and `dy` are applied to `x` and `y`, we need to ensure that at the beginning of the next iteration, we are set to handle the next pair.

Assuming the last pair processed was the first one, the next iteration will involve the second pair: `(-2, 1)`. Thus, `dx` and `dy` will take on the next values from the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 - 2`, and `ny` is `2 + 1`.**
