Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples of positions added during the loop execution, and if `piece` is set to 2, then `dist[2]` has been updated for all reachable positions that meet the condition, with `parent[2]` reflecting the relationships based on the position updates. No valid moves were found, and `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
