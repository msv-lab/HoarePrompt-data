Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` has been assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state of the variables.***
