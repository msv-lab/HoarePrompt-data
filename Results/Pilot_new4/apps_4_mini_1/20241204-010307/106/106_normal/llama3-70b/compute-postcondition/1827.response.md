Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 3; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition does not hold, no operations are performed.***
