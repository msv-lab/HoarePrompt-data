The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. In the initial state, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `piece` is stated to remain unchanged at the value 2, the output state reflects the specific assignment to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables retain their previous descriptions because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices with `dist[1][ncur]` now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`**.
