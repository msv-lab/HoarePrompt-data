The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent[2][ncur]` variable. The state of other variables remains unchanged, and since `ncur` and `cur` are undefined, the specific values cannot be determined. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `nx` is undefined, `ny` is undefined, `ncur` is undefined, `cur` is undefined, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
