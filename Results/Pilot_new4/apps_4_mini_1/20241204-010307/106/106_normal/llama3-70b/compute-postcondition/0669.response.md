The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]` based on the current value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the `parent` array has been updated with the new value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
