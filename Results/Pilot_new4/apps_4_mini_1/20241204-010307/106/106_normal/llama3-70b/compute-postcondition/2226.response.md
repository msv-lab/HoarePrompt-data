After executing the code snippet, the variable `queue` is updated to include a new tuple consisting of `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables retain their previous values, reflecting the state before the code execution. The values of `piece`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist[1][cur]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`piece` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state and now `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` has increased by 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
