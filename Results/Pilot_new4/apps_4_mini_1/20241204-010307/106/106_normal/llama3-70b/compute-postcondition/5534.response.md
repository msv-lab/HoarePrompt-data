The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is -2 and `ny` is -1, `ncur` will be equal to `A[-2][-1]`. Since the values of `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, and `cur` are not affected, the output state should reflect the new value of `ncur` based on the current indices.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`.**
