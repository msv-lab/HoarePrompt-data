The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are included in the tuple, which means that the variable `queue` is updated to include this new pair. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur`, `queue` includes the new entry `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
