To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the loop statement and the current state:

1. The loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` which are four possible directions: `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. Given that there are four pairs, the loop will execute four times, once for each direction.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, it is implied that the loop has either processed one direction or multiple directions depending on how many times it has run. Since `dx` and `dy` are iterated over pairs, let's assume the last pair processed was the first one, `(-1, -1)`, and therefore, we need to prepare the state for the next iteration.

3. Since the loop iterates through four predefined pairs, after processing the first pair `(-1, -1)`, the next pair in the sequence would be `(-1, 1)`.

4. The state variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged in this context unless certain conditions within the loop body are met. In this case, since the loop does not alter these variables inherently, we can retain their values.

Given this analysis, the adjustments for the next iteration primarily revolve around moving to the next pair of `(dx, dy)` while other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)`; `ny` is equal to `1 + 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements.**
