Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2]` captures the minimum distances from the start position to reachable positions according to the movement rules, `parent[2]` reflects the tracking of the paths taken to reach those positions, `queue` contains the pair `(cur, i)` appended to it, and if the loop does not execute, then `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `queue` would have that pair added. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
