Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes all new entries generated during the iterations along with the entry `(ncur, 2)`. The values of `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.***
