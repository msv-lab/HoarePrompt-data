The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and associates it with `piece`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the state of `A[nx][ny]`, which has not changed from its previous definition. All other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`**
