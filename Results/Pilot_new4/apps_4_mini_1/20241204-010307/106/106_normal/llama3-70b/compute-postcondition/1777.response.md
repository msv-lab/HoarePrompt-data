The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The impact of the code is specifically on the `dist` array, where the value at `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to the value of `dist[0][cur]` plus 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
