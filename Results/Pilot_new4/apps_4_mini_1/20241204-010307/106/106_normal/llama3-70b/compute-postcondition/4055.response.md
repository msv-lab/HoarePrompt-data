The `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing `(ncur, 0)`. The previous values of the variables are not affected directly by this operation, and the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `queue` will now contain an additional element which is the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]; `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
