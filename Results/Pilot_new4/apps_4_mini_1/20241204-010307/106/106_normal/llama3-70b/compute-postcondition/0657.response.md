According to the code, the loop will execute for each pair of `(dx, dy)` values provided in the list. In this case, there are 4 pairs: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Since `y` is currently 1, it is likely that `y` will be incremented during the loop executions. The current iteration has processed the first pair, and thus we assume that `dx` and `dy` correspond to the first pair `(-1, -1)`.

Since there are 4 pairs, after processing the first pair, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration. The next pair corresponds to the second iteration `(dx, dy)`, which will be `(-1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1.**
