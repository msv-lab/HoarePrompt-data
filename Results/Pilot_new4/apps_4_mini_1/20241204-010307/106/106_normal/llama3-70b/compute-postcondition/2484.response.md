Postcondition: ***`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
