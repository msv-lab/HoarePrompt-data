Output State: **`piece` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur` for all reachable indices, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
