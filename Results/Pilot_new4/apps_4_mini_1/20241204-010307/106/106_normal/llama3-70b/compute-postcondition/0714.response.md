Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `ny` equals `2 + dy`, and if the value of `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
