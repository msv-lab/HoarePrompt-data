Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.***
