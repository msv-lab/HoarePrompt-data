Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 1, `index` in directions is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains (ncur, 1). If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `parent` or `queue`.***
