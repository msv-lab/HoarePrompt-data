The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, which means that `parent[0][ncur]` will now hold the value of `cur`. The `piece` variable is also included in the assignment, indicating that it might be treated as part of a tuple or another data structure alongside `cur`, but its actual handling in this context isn't specified. However, the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, and `queue` are unaffected. The dimensions of the array `parent` likely remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is still 0 if not modified, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` might be modified based on the next values of `nx` and `ny`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
