Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated distances for valid `ncur` indices, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `(cur, piece)` pair for those `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 2)` appended during the iterations, including the tuple `(cur, i)`.***
