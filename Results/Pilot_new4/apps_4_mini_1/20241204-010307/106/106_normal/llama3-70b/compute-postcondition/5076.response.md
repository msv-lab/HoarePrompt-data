Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
