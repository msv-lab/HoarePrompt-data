Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then if the `piece` is not equal to `i`, `piece` is set to 2 if conditions were met at least once, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` from those conditions alongside the initial tuples of `(ncur, 1)` and the new tuple `(cur, i)`. If no conditions were met, `piece` remains 0, and `queue` contains only the initial tuples `(ncur, 0)`. The final distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur` are stored in `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`.***
