The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the existing values of `x` and `y`, combined with the values from `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are lists with multiple tuples, it's necessary to consider that `nx` and `ny` will take on multiple possible values depending on which tuple is selected from the list.

1. Current values:
   - `x = 2`
   - `y = 1`
   - `dx` and `dy` will take on values from the list [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)].

2. Evaluating for each tuple in the list:
   - For `(-2, -1)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + (-2) = 0`
     - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   - For `(-2, 1)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + (-2) = 0`
     - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - For `(-1, -2)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
     - `ny = 1 + (-2) = -1`
   - For `(-1, 2)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
     - `ny = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - For `(1, -2)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `ny = 1 + (-2) = -1`
   - For `(1, 2)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `ny = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - For `(2, -1)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   - For `(2, 1)`: 
     - `nx = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

3. Valid states for `nx` and `ny`:
   - `nx` can take values: 0, 1, 3, 4
   - `ny` can take values: -1, 0, 2, 3

Since the range for `N` is not directly affecting `x` and `y`, we still maintain those values. The output must reflect the range of possible values for `nx` and `ny` after the calculations.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, 1, 3, or 4, `ny` is -1, 0, 2, or 3**
