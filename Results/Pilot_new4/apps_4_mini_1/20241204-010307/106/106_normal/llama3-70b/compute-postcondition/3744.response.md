Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`; the `queue` now contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair and the new pair `(ncur, 2)`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
