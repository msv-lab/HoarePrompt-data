The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The value is derived from the current value in `dist[1][cur]` increased by 1. The variables `ncur` and `cur` are used as indices to access `dist`. Since we are not given the specific values of `dist[1][cur]`, `ncur`, and `cur`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dist[1][ncur]`. However, we know it is increased by 1 from the current value of `dist[1][cur]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
