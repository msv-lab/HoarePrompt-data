The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values still hold true. The only variable affected in the output state is `parent[2][ncur]`, which now holds a tuple (cur, piece).

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece)**
