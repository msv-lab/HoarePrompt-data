The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x - 1` and `1`, respectively. Since `x` is in the range `0 <= x < N`, and `N` is an integer between `3` and `10`, the value of `nx` will be `x - 1`, which is a valid index from `-1` up to `N-2`. The value of `ny` is `1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`.**
