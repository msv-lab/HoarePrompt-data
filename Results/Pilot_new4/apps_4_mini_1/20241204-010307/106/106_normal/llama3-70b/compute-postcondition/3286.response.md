The value at `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`, we do not have specific values for `A` or `cur`. However, the code updates `dist[1][ncur]` by adding `1` to `dist[1][cur]`. Without specific values for `cur` or `ncur`, we cannot determine specific outcomes for `dist[1][ncur]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
