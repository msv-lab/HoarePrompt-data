Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`; if `0 ≤ nx < N` and `0 ≤ ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` has a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes occur in the `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
