According to the code, the for loop is iterating over a predefined list of tuples representing coordinate changes. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N` and `y` since the list has a fixed length of 8 elements, ensuring that the loop will always iterate 8 times.

However, since `y` is set to `N`, and `N` needs to be within the range specified (3 to 10), it is essential to note that `y` will always equal `N`.

For the loop to be executed, the values need to be adjusted to ensure that `N` is indeed within the specified bounds, and `y` must reflect the value of `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`**
