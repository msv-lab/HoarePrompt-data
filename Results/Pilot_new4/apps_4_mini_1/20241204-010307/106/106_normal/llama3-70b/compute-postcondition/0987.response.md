Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` remains 0, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes to `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, or `queue`.***
