The statement `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged in their states. The initial state for `ncur` is determined earlier in the code and can be a specific index based on the previous calculations. 

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`, the variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are also part of the structure but are not directly modified except for appending to `queue`.

Thus, the output state will include the appended tuple in the `queue`, while retaining all other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][1 + dy]`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**
