The code assigns values to the `parent` array at the specified indices. The value at `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, but the values of `cur` and `piece` are not given in the initial state. Therefore, while we know that `parent[2][ncur]` is updated, we cannot specify what it is updated to without those values.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
