The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is `1`. After that, the code updates the matrix `dist` at the position `[0][ncur]`. 

The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` modifies the entry in the `dist` array corresponding to `ncur` as it assigns it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. However, the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
