The given code snippet modifies the `dist` array based on the current state of the variables. Specifically, it updates `dist[0][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

To break this down:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, and `nx` equals `x - 1`, which is not explicitly defined but indicates that it depends on the value of `x`.
- The previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be replaced with `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Since the values of `dist`, `cur`, and `A` are not provided, we can't derive specific numeric outputs, but we can state the relation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
