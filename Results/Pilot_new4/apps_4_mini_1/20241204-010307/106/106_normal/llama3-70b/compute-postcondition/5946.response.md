The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as none of them are modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of all variables, with the addition of the new element in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`; `queue` includes the new element `(ncur, 2)`.**
