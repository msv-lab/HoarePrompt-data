Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1). If `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then the tuple (ncur, 1) is appended to `queue`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece` is assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If `nx` and `ny` are out of the range [0, N), no operations are performed.***
