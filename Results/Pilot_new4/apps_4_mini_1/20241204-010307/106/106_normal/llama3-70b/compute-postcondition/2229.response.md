According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Since the loop is designed to iterate through all the elements in this list, it will execute for each pair of `(dx, dy)`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state reflects that `piece` is 0 and other variables are in their initial state, with `nx` and `ny` calculated based on the previous `x` and `y` values. As the loop progresses, it will iterate through each `(dx, dy)` pair.

The loop will execute a total of 4 times, once for each pair. If we are considering the state just before the next iteration, we note that it will be the 1st iteration for the first tuple, the 2nd for the second tuple, and so on. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple to be processed will be `(1, 1)`, which is the last pair in the list.

State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
