According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. It is stated that `N` is between 3 and 10, which means `N` is guaranteed to be at least 3. Therefore, the loop will have at least 3 iterations. 

Before the loop starts, `y` is not yet defined, but it will take values from 0 to N-1 during the loop execution. Since `N` is at least 3, `y` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

The values of `x`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `cur`, and `piece` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they may be relevant for the operations inside the loop body, which is omitted.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` starts at 0, and the loop will iterate `N` times.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0**
