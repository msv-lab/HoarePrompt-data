The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The state of the program indicates that `ncur` is dependent on the values of `nx` and `ny`, which are further defined by `dx` and `dy`. The previous values of the affected variables remain valid, and there is no direct calculation or change in the other variables. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
