The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, as this operation does not modify them. The relevant state of the program is now updated to include the new state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `nx` is not defined; `ny` is not defined; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
