The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is computed from the values of `nx` and `ny`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`, which means `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the combination of those two values.

The impact of the code on the program is that it modifies the value of `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we do not have specific values for `cur`, `piece`, or `ncur` as they depend on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`.**
