Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
