Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
