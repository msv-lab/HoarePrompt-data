The code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. The specific values of `cur` and `dist` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numeric value of `dist[1][cur]`. However, we can infer that `dist[1][ncur]` is now one more than whatever `dist[1][cur]` was. 

Since `ncur` is assigned the value `A[1][3]`, the state of the variable `ncur` remains the same. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is A[1][3], and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1**.
