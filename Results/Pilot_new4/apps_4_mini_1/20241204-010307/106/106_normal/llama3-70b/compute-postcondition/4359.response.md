The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = N + dy`, respectively. Given that both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `ncur` will be set to the value in the 2D array `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`. The state of other variables remains unchanged, but we now know the value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `dx, dy` are the next direction changes from the list, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
