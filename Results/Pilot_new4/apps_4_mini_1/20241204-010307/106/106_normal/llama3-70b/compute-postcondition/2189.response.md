Postcondition: ***`dist[2][...]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable indices from the current position, `parent[2][...]` reflects the parent nodes for each updated index, and `queue` contains one element `[(cur, i)]` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
