The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing the value `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged as a result of this operation. The state of the `queue` variable is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
