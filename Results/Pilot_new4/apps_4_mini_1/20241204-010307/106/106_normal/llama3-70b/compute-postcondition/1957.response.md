Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, and the values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the last executed values of `dx` and `dy` during the loop, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If conditions for updates were met during the loop executions, `dist[0][ncur]` is the minimum distance for each reachable index, while `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last position from which that index was reached. If no conditions were met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their state before the loop.**
