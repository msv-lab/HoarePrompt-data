In the provided code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), we can determine the values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Since `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, the value of `nx` will depend on the value of `x`. However, since `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and there is no information on its value, we cannot determine `nx` exactly without it.

For `ny`, since `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `ny` will range from 1 (when `y` is 0) to 9 (when `y` is 8).

Thus, `ncur` will be assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `ny` will be between 1 and 9, and `nx` remains undefined due to `x` being unspecified.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is between 1 and 9; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
