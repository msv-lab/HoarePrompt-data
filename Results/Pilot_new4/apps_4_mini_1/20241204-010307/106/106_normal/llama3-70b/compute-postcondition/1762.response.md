The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the value of `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is defined as equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are used directly to set the value of `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The initial state indicates:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is 2
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x + 2`
- `ny` is 3
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is 0
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and is now less than or equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The impact of the code is that `parent[0][ncur]` will now hold the value of `cur` and `piece`. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
