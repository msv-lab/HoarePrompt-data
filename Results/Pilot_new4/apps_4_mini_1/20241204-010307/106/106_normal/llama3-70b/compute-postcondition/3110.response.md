The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This operation does not change the values of any other variables; it simply modifies the `queue` by adding an element to it. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 1)`.**
