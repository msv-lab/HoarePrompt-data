The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations using `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. 

Given the initial values:
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `y` is 2 
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < N\)

- For `nx`: 
  \[
  nx = x + dx = x - 1
  \]
  
- For `ny`: 
  \[
  ny = y + dy = 2 - 2 = 0
  \]

This means `ny` is updated to 0, while `nx` retains its relationship with `x`.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is 0**
