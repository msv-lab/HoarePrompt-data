The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, but it is used to index `parent[0]`. Since `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` now references both `cur` and 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` is equal to 0, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and 0.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` is equal to 0, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and 0.**
