Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10 with `x` equal to 2, `y` equal to 2, `nx` equal to 1, and `ny` equal to 2. If `nx` is between 0 and `N-1` and `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, then `ncur` is set to `A[1][2]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)` and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`.***
