Postcondition: ***`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y - 1]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
