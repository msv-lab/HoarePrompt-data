Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made. If `nx` is out of bounds or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes occur.***
