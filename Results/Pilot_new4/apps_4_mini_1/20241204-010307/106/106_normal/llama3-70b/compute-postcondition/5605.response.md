Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, while the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged.***
