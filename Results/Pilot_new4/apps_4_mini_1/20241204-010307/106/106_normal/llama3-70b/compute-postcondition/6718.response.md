Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true, then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains all reachable positions from (1, 1) plus the new position `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, 2)`. If the condition does not hold, the state remains as described without any updates occurring.***
