According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple of `(dx, dy)` in the specified list of moves. The for loop will execute once for each of the 8 tuples in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. The loop will go through each of the 8 pairs of `(dx, dy)`, where `dx` and `dy` will change with each iteration. Since `y` starts at 1, the first iteration will use `(-2, -1)`, the second will use `(-2, 1)`, and so forth.

The loop executes for all the tuple pairs, and in your case, if we consider the loop has executed for all pairs, the next pair would be the first pair again, which is `(-2, -1)`.

However, we don't modify `N`, `y`, or the values of `nx` and `ny` because the loop does not affect them directly; it merely iterates through the specified moves.

Since we are considering the next iteration of the loop (which is the first one if we are cycling through the pairs), the next dx, dy pair would still remain the same as the current state of `y` is fixed at 1 and is a part of the iteration. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be set to `(-2, -1)`, and we continue with `N` between 3 and 10. The values of `nx` and `ny` would need to be calculated depending on the current values of `x` (which is not provided) and `y`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2` (assuming `dx` is -2) + `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 - 1` (assuming `dy` is -1) + `dy`.**
