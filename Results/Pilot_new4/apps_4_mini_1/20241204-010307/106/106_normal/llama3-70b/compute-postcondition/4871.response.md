The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The initial states of the variables do not change, but the state of `parent` is updated.

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is derived from `nx` and `ny`, we have to consider that the specific value of `ncur` is dependent on the matrix `A` and the values of `nx` and `ny`. However, since there are no changes to `N`, `dist`, `cur`, or `piece`, we can keep their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
