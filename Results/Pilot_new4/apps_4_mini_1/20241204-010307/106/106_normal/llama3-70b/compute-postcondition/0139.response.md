The `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables, and all preconditions that remain valid are included in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 â‰¤ `nx`, `ny` < `N; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, piece).**
