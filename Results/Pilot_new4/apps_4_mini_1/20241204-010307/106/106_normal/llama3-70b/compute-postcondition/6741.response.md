According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable provided in the for loop, which is a list of tuples representing the changes in x and y coordinates. This list is already defined and will be used to iterate through the potential directional changes. The loop will run for each tuple in the list.

The variables `N`, `x`, and `y` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may relate to the context in which the loop operates (like position updates or constraints). However, they do not need adjustment for the loop to simply execute.

The current state of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` also does not affect whether the loop iterates; these states may influence what occurs within the loop body but do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Thus, the states that need to be highlighted for the loop to execute correctly, based on the current context provided, include the state of `piece` that determines if `(cur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, `piece` must not equal `i` for `(cur, 2)` to be added to `queue`**
