The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the specific index `parent[1][ncur]`. However, the value of `cur` is undefined in the current context, meaning we cannot assign a concrete value to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged, and the output state must reflect the unchanged variables while acknowledging the update that cannot specify `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[3][0], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece` (with `cur` being undefined)**.
