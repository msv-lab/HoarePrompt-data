According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined set of direction changes represented by the tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. Each iteration corresponds to one of these direction changes. Since there are four tuples in the list, the loop will execute a total of four times.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the last direction (1, 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it would need to start over with the first tuple from the list.

Since the loop is based on a fixed set of directions, the relevant states do not change based on the contents of the loop. The `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` states are not affected by the direction tuples themselves but rather by the logic that executes in the loop body.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that the loop will start again with the first tuple.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Ready to process the first direction (-1, -1).**
