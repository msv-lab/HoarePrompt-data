The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged, but `parent[1][ncur]` is now set to this new value.

The conditions before executing the code remain unchanged, so:

- `N` is still an integer between 3 and 10.
- `x` is still greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`.
- `piece` is still 1.
- `dist[0][ncur]` is still greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`.
- `nx` is still `x + dx`.
- `ny` is still `y + dy`.
- The values of `nx` and `ny` remain such that 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`.
- `ncur` is still assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.
- `dist[1][ncur]` remains equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 ≤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`.**
