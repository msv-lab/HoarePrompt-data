Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the minimum distances updated based on valid moves from the initial state, `parent[1]` contains the connections made for valid moves, `queue` contains at least one tuple representing a valid move (a node). The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
