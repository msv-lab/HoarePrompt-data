Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for all reachable indices; `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the parent of each reachable index based on the updates made during the loop; `piece` is 0; `queue` contains all newly appended tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each index that was updated; if the loop did not execute, `dist` remains unchanged, and `parent` retains its original state.**
