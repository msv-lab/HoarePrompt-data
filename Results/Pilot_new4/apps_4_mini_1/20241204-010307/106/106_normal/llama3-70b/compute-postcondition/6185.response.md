The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, we can determine the following:

- `nx` becomes `x + (-1)`, which simplifies to `x - 1`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 0`, which simplifies to `y` and remains 1.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the value of `x` is not specified, but it's inferred that it is an integer within a range based on the context of `N`.

The updated output state reflects the changes in `nx` and `ny` while preserving the characteristics of the other variables:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1**
