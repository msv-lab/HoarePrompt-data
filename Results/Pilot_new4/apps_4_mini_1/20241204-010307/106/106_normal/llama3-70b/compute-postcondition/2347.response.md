The code adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `queue` already contains some elements, and now it will also include the new tuple. The states of `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
