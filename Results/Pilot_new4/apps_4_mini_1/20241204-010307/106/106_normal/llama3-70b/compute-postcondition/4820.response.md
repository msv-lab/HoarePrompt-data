Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions, `parent[2]` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions, and `queue` now contains the previous entries plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, given that the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
