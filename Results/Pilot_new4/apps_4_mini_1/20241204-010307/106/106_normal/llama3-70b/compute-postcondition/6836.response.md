The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, and the state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
