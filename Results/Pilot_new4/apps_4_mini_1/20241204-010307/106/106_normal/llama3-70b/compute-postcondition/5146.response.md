Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, ensuring that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]` if the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the variables.***
