Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples generated during the loop iterations, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur` based on the distance from `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged throughout the execution.**
