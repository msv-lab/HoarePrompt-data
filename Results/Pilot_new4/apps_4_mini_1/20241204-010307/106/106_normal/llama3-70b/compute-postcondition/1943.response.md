The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The state of `nx` is defined as `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is `5`. The value of `A` is not specified, so we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur`, but it will be equal to the value at the position indexed by `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `5`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
