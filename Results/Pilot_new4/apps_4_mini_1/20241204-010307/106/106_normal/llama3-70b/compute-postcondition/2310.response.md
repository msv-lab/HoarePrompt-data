The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this assignment will update the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `dist` remains unchanged except `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment.**
