In the given code, the statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value in the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]` based on the value at the index `[1][cur]`. 

The state of `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remains unchanged except for the specific item in the `dist` array which is being updated.

1. `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 
2. The previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` changes to the new value based on `dist[1][cur]`.

The variables `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, except for the updated value in the `dist` array.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains unchanged, `dist` is updated such that `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` states remain as they are, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]**.
