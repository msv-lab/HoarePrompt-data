Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), then if `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and `queue` includes (ncur, 0) as a new element; otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of the specified range, no changes are made to any variables.***
