Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` has an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
