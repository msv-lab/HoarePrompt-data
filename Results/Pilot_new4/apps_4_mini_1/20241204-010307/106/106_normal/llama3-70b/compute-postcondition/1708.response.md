The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. We know:

- `dx` is -1, thus `nx` will be `x - 1`.
- `dy` is -1, thus `ny` will be `y - 1`.

As a result:
- `nx` becomes `x + (-1)`, which is equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` becomes `1 + (-1)`, which simplifies to `0`.

Now we need to analyze the ranges for `nx` and `ny`:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, so `0 <= nx < N` implies `0 <= x - 1 < N`. Since `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, this condition holds true for the possible values of `x`.
- As for `ny`, we have `ny = 0`, and since `0 <= ny < N`, this condition is also satisfied because `N` is at least 3. 

Thus, after executing the code, we have the updated values:
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is `0`

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 0.**
