Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains all reachable positions added during the iterations. If no iterations occur, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged for unreachable points, while `queue` remains empty.**
