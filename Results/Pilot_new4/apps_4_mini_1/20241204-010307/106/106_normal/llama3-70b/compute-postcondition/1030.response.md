The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which is now equal to `cur` and `piece`. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, but we know that `piece` is already equal to `2`. The previous values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `2`.**
