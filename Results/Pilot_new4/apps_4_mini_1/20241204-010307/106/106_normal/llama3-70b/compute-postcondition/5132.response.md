The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`. The value of `ncur` is `A[4][2]`, and `piece` is `1`. The value of `cur` is unknown at this moment.

Since no other variables have changed and the other variables retain their previous values, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 4, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is A[4][2], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][A[4][2]]` is (cur, 1)**
