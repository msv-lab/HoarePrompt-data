Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where the conditions are met, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Additionally, the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
