The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are known (`x` is 1 and `y` is 0), while `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so the results for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the output state retains all the information about the initial conditions that are still valid and updates only the changed variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `dist` must be initialized for reachable positions; `parent` must reflect previous positions for reachable states; `queue` should contain reachable tuples derived from the iterations; `piece` is still 0 if the conditions were met; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
