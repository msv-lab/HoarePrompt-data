Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N` (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
