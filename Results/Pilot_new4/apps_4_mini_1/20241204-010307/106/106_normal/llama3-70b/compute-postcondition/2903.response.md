The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`, which modifies the state of the `queue` variable. The values of other variables remain unchanged, but we can detail their relationships as provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, with `dist[0][ncur]` now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now contains the previously processed tuples plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `N + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0.**
