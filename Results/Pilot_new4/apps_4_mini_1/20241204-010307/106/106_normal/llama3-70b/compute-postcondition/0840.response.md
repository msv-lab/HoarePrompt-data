The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this operation. The state of the queue changes as it now includes a new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
