The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged apart from the addition to the `queue`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices with `dist[1][ncur]` now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` now contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`, `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 1)`.**
