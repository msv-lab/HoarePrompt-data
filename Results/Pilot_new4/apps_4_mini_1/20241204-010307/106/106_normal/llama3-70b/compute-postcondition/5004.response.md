Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains all valid tuples and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
