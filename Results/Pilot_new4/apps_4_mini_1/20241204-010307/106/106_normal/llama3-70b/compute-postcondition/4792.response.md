Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`; `nx` is 0 + `dx`, `ny` is 0 + `dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the boundaries of the grid, meaning 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, and `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
