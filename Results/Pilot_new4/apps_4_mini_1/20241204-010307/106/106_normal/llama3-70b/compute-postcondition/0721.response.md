The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
