The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the two-dimensional array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The conditions indicate that `nx` and `ny` are computed based on `x` and `y`, where `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `2 + dy`, with `nx` and `ny` satisfying 0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
