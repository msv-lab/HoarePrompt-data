The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variable `x` is not mentioned, so it is not possible to determine its exact value in this context. The other variables `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, and `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.
