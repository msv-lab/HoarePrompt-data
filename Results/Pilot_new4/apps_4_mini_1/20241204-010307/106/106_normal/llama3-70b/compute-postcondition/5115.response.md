The line of code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. Before this operation, it is given that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. This means that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is at least `dist[1][cur] + 2`.

After executing the code, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be exactly `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged, and our output state reflects the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` in relation to `dist[1][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`**.
