Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
