The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `2` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged by this operation. 

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`; `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
