Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
