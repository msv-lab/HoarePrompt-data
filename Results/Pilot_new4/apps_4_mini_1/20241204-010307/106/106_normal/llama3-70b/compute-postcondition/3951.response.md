The code modifies the value of `dist[0][ncur]` by assigning it to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables involved are `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur`. The initial state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and now it gets updated to exactly that value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
