According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the valid moves represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. Here, `dx` and `dy` are the changes in the x and y coordinates respectively. Since the loop iterates over these possible direction changes, it will execute regardless of the current state of the other variables.

However, for the loop to properly update `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, we need to ensure that there are valid positions to move to, given the current position `(1, 0)`. The conditions for valid moves are:
1. The new position must be within the defined boundaries: `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.
2. There must be at least one valid position reachable from `(1, 0)` such that the new position `(nx, ny)` corresponds to a valid entry in `dist` and `parent`.

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, valid positions will always exist for the given starting point `(1, 0)`, as long as `dist` and `parent` are initialized properly for these positions.

Thus, the states that need to be reflected are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (ensured by initial state).
- `(x, y)` is the current position `(1, 0)`.
- The boundary conditions are satisfied for the possible moves.

Considering the context and the requirement for the loop to execute properly with the existing positions, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` is initialized for all valid positions, `parent` is initialized for all valid positions, `queue` is initialized to contain reachable positions from (1, 0)**
