The code adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial values of the variables are:

- `piece` is 1
- `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0)
- `nx` is `x + 1`
- `ny` is `y`
- `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`
- `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`

After executing the code, the `queue` now contains an additional element, which is the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. None of the other variables' values have changed; therefore, the output state needs to reflect the current state of the program with the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
