The code assigns a tuple `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]` along with the value of `piece`, which is `1`. The value of `ncur` has already been assigned earlier as `A[nx][ny]`. The state of `parent` changes based on the value of `cur`, but the actual values of `cur`, `ncur`, `piece`, and `parent` are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the last element of the tuple, `dy` is the last second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned value `cur` and piece `1`.**
