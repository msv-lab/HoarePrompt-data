Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive)***
