The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` already contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. The addition of `(ncur, 0)` means that `ncur` remains unchanged, and the value of `piece` is still equal to `0`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` are valid; `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)`, `(ncur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 0)`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to (cur, 0).**
