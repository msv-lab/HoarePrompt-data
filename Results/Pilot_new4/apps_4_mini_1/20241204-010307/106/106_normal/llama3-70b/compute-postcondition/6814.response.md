The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated according to the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given the initial values, `x` is 1 and `dx` is 0, therefore `nx` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`. For `ny`, since `y` is 2 and `dy` is 1, `ny` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3**
