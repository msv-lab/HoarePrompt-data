The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` can be one of the tuples: (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), or (0, 1). Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the specific values taken by `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, where `dx` and `dy` take values from (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1).**
