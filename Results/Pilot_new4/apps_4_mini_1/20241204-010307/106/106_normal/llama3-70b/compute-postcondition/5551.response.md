Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.***
