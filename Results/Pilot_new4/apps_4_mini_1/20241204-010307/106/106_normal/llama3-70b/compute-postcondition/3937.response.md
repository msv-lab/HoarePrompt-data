Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then the valid position `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the shortest distances for valid positions reachable from the starting position `(x, y)` based on piece type being 2, and `parent[2][ncur]` contains the parent references for those positions. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their states before the execution of the if statement.***
