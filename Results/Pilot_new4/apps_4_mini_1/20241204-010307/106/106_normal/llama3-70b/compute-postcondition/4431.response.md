Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made.***
