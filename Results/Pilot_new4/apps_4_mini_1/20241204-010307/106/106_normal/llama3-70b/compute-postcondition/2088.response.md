Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, and `piece` is equal to 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(A[x][y + 1], 2)`. Otherwise, if the condition fails, no changes occur to `parent`, `dist`, or `queue`.***
