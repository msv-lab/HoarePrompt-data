The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`, but it does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state will indicate the updated state of `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
