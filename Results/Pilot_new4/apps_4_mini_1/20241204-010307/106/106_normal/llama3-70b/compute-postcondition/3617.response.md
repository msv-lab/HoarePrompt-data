Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`; `y` is an integer between `0` and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y - 1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, none of these updates occur.***
