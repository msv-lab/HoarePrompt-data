To analyze the impact of the code snippet, we need to break down what has been provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is between 3 and 10.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `piece` is 2.
   - `dx` is -1.
   - `dy` is 0.
   - `nx` is equal to `x - 1`.
   - `ny` is 2.
   - The condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, which means both `nx` and `ny` are valid indices based on the size of array `A`.

2. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The code assigns the value of `dist[2][ncur]` based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`. However, we need to understand the value of `ncur`.
   - `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` and `ny` are valid indices, `ncur` has a specific value from the array `A`.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Since we do not have the specific values of `cur`, `dist`, or `A`, we cannot specify exact values but can express the changes relative to these variables.

4. **Output State:**
   - Since `dist[2][ncur]` is updated but we do not know the exact numerical values of `dist` or `cur`, the output state reflects that we have updated `dist[2][ncur]` based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`.

Thus, the Output State will include the known conditions and the change made by the code execution.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
