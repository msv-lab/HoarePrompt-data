According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` and the value of `N`. The loop iterates over the range of `N`, which means it can run as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning `N` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` will become 1 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged.**
