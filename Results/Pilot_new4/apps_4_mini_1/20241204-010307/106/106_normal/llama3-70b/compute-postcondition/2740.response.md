The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variable `dx` and `dy` are not defined after the loop has completed, meaning their values cannot be determined, thus their impact cannot be quantified. However, `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is the current y-coordinate
- `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `dx`, `dy` are not defined after the loop has completed

After executing the code, `nx` and `ny` will reflect the new computed coordinates based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, since `dx` and `dy` are not defined, we cannot specify their values or the exact result of `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `dx`, `dy` are not defined after the loop has completed.**
