The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are equal to `x - 1` and `y - 1`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is at least 4, and `dist` is valid for reachable indices. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ncur` is now equal to the element at the indices `A[x - 1][y - 1]`. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; `cur`, `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1; `dx` and `dy` have been reset to the first tuple (-1, -1); `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`.**
