The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used to create this tuple. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx = 2 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
