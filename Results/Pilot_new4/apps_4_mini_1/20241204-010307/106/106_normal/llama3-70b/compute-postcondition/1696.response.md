Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 } and `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }. `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` for valid combinations of `dx` and `dy`. `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the conditions checked against `dist[0][cur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` will have values derived from `cur` and `piece`. The `queue` will contain tuples of all valid `(ncur, 0)` appended during the iterations. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial or prior values.**
