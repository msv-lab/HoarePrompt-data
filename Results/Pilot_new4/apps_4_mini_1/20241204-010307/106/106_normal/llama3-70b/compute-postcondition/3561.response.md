According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list of directions provided by `[(dx, dy)]` and the state of the `queue`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one position in `queue` that is reachable from `(x, y)`. If `queue` is empty, the loop will not run, and `dist` and `parent` will remain unchanged.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the following states:
- `queue` must contain at least one position that can be reached.
- The minimum distances in `dist[1][ncur]` and the last position in `parent[1][ncur]` will not change if the loop does not execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need:
State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `queue` must contain at least one reachable position.**
