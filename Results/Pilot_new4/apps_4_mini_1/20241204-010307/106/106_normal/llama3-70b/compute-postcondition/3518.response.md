The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The conditions for `ncur` to be assigned a value are not evaluated in this code snippet, but it does not affect the other variables.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the previous values of `x` and `y`, incorporating `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**
