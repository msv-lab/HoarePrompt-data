`parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` have not changed based on the code snippet provided. The other variables remain unaffected, except for the assignment made to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances, `parent[1]` contains path information, `queue` includes valid moves from `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1, parent[2][ncur] = (cur, piece)`**.
