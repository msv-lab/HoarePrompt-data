The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is defined as `A[-2][2]`. The expression assigns `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. However, since specific values for `dist` and `cur` have not been provided, we cannot determine exact values but can express them in terms of the existing variables.

The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]` in relation to the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, where `ncur` is defined as `A[-2][2]`.**
