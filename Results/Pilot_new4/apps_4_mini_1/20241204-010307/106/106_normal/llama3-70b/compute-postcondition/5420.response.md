The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the position `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, but we acknowledge that they are valid and being used in the assignment.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`**.
