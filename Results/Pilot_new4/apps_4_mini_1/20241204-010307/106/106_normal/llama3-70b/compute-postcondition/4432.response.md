Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `A` is a valid two-dimensional array; `cur` is defined; `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point; `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move; `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 1)` that were added during the iterations of the loop. If valid moves were possible, `dist[1][ncur]` will reflect the updated distances for each reachable position from `cur`, and `parent[1][ncur]` will contain the corresponding parent states. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `queue` will be empty.**
