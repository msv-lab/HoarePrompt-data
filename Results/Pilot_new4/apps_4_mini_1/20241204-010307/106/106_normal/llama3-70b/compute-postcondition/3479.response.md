Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for valid positions, `parent[0]` is set accordingly, `queue` contains valid tuples from previous executions, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0` to `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `piece` equals `2`, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
