According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in the variables `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. The current values of `dx` and `dy` at the end of the last iteration are `dx = -2` and `dy = 1`. 

The next iteration will take the next tuple from the list, which is `(-1, -2)` for the second iteration. Assuming that the loop can execute as long as there are more tuples in the list.

Given this, the loop will execute again, and the new values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to `-1` and `-2` respectively.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`.**
