According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of movements `dx` and `dy`. The loop will always execute since there are four pairs defined in the list `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`. 

However, for the loop body to effectively process each movement, we need to ensure the context of the positions being evaluated is valid. The state variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` provide important context.

- `N` is between 3 and 10, indicating the dimensions of a grid (if applicable).
- `x` is initialized to 1 and `y` to 0, which suggests the current position (1, 0) is valid within the grid dimensions.
- `dist` and `parent` must be appropriately initialized before any moves since they store distances and predecessors for valid positions.
- `queue` indicates the reachable positions, and if there are valid moves, it should contain relevant tuples.

To ensure the loop executes with valid context, we need to consider:
1. The tuple `(dx, dy)` will modify the current position `(x, y)`, so we need to ensure that the resulting position remains within the bounds defined by `N`.
2. We need to confirm that `queue` has valid positions to relate to the moved `(x, y)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute properly:
- `N` must be greater than or equal to 3 (already ensured by the given state).
- The current position `(x, y)`, after applying the movements `(dx, dy)`, must be within valid bounds (1 ≤ x ≤ N and 0 ≤ y < N).
- The `dist` and `parent` should be initialized correctly for valid movements.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, `queue` contains reachable positions, and `(x + dx, y + dy)` must remain within valid grid bounds.**
