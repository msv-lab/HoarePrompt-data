In the given code, the variable `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated to a new value, which is the result of the expression `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The initial state defines that `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and the condition that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` holds true.

After executing the line of code, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. This means that the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` is now replaced with a value that is 1 greater than `dist[0][cur]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but we need to reflect that `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
