The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous state. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**
