The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the location `parent[2][ncur]`. This means that `parent[2][ncur]` will hold two values: the value of `cur` (which is the current position) and the value of `piece` (which is 2). The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, it will be updated but its specific value is not given in the initial state. However, we do know that `ncur` will be an index related to the array `A`.

The output state will include the unchanged values for `N`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the updated value for `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`**.
