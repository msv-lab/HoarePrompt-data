According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements: left, right, up, and down. For the loop to execute, the variables `dx` and `dy` must be initialized to the values from the list, which is guaranteed by the loop structure itself. The provided states (`N`, `queue`, `dist`, and `parent`) do not influence whether the loop will execute, as they are not dependent on the loop's execution conditions.

Since the loop does not depend on any external state modifications, it will simply iterate over the four specified movement directions. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the states related to `N`, `queue`, `dist`, or `parent` for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly, and `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values**
