Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` considering the knight's moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the parents for those reachable cells, and `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces. If the loop did not execute, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
