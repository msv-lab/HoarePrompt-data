The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and the value `2` is assigned directly as part of the tuple. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4; `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`; `piece` is equal to 2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`; `queue` contains the previous elements along with the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`; `piece` is equal to 2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`; `queue` contains `(ncur, 2)` added to it.**
