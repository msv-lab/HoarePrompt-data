The code updates the `dist` array at index `[1][ncur]` with the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. However, we need the specific values of `cur` and `ncur` to determine how `dist` is affected. 

Assuming `cur` is defined and `ncur` is previously set to `A[x - 1][-1]`, it will result in the update of `dist[1][ncur]`. Given the initial state, `ncur` depends on the values of `x` (which is within the bounds of `0 <= x < N`) and `A` being a valid 2D array structure.

Thus, we can determine that:
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to the value `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

The output state will maintain the previous states of the variables while noting the impact of this update on `dist`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][-1]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
