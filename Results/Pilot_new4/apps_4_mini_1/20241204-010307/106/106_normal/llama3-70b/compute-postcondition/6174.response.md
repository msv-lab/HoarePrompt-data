Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
