The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous states of the variables are not affected by this operation. However, we know that `ncur` is derived from the previous calculations and is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which relies on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the `dist` and `parent` structures remain unchanged aside from the addition to the queue. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
