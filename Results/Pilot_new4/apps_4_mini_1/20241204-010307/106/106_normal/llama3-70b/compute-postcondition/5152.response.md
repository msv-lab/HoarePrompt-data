Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples with `parent[2][ncur]` updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
