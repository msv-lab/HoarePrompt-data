Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
