Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` now contains `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` along with all valid moves `(ncur, 1)`. Additionally, `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`.***
