The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[0][ncur]`. The previous state of `parent[0][ncur]` is not specified, but now it will hold a tuple of `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`; `queue` may include a new tuple if conditions are met; `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
