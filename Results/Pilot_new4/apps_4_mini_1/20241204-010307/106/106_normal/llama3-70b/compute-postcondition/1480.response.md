To evaluate the impact of the code snippet `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, we need to consider the initial state of the variables and the operation being performed.

Initial State:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 0
- `nx` is 1
- `ny` is 1

The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D array `A` at the position specified by `nx` and `ny` to the variable `ncur`. The specific value that `ncur` will take depends on the contents of the 2D array `A` and the indices `nx` and `ny`, which are both equal to 1.

However, since we do not have the specific contents of the array `A`, we can denote `ncur` as `A[1][1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`.**
