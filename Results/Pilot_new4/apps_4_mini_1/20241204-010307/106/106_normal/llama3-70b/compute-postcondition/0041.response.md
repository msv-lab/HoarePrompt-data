Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values, `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.***
