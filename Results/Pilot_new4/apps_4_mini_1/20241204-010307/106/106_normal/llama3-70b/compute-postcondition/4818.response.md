The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The variable `queue` is being updated but other variables remain unchanged. The state of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `piece`) stays the same as before. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position, `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from (x,y) to all reachable positions, `parent[2]` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` now contains the previous entries plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
