The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Here, `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`. Since `x + dx` and `y + dy` are both within the bounds of `A`, this assignment will successfully set `ncur`. The initial state provides that `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, but this does not affect the assignment to `ncur`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
