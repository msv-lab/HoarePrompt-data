Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is defined and valid, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can be updated based on prior conditions, `queue` is properly populated with positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
