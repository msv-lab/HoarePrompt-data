Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. It is true that `piece` is equal to 2 and the current value of `ncur` is such that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
