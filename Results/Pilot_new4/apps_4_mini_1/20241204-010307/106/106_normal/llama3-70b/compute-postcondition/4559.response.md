The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this means that the value of `dist[0][cur]` must be updated accordingly, while `ncur` and `cur` remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which is greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, where `0 <= nx < N` and `ny` is 0, the current value of `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which is greater than its previous value.**
