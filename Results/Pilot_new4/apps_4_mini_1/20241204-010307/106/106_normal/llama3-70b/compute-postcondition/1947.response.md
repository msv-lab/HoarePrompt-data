Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to 5, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `queue` includes the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 0)`. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
