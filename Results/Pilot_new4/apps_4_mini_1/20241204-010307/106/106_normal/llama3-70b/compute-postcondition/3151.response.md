Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `piece` is updated to 2 for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs found during the iterations; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance values based on updates made, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur` updated, and `queue` includes the original valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs along with the new pair `(cur, i)`. If no valid pairs were found, `piece` remains 1, while `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
