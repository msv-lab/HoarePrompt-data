The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is 0, and `y` is 1. Therefore, `nx` becomes `0 + dx`, which is equal to `dx`, and `ny` becomes `1 + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are determined by the first and second elements of the tuple, respectively. The states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not affected by this operation, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
