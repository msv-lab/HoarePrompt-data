Postcondition: ***`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) with `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, that is, `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
