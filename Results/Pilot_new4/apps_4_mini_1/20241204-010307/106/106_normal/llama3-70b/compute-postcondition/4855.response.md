The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The initial state specifies that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but there are no specific values given for `cur` or `piece`, apart from `piece` being equal to 1. Therefore, `parent[1][ncur]` will be updated to hold the values of `cur` and 1.

The other variables remain unaffected as the code only modifies `parent[1][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position + 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, 1.**
