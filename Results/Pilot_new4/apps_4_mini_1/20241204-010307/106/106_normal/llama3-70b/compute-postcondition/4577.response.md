The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and 0 are used directly. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables that remain unchanged alongside the new state of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 0)`**.
