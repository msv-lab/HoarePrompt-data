According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` defined in the list `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The loop executes for each pair, and since there are 4 pairs, the loop will run 4 times in total. 

At the end of the last iteration, if we take into account the current state, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1 for the current iteration. For the next iteration, the `dx` and `dy` values will change to the next pair in the list, which is `(1, -1)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `dx` will be 1 and `dy` will be -1. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `queue`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `parent` will remain unchanged unless modified in the loop body.

State: **If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and possibly also `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
