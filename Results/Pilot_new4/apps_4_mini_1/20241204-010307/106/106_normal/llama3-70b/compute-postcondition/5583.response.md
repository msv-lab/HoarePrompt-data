The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `A`, `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` remain unchanged. The only change is that `queue` now contains an additional tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `queue` has an extra element `(ncur, 2)` added.**
