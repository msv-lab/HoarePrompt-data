Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the selected tuple `(dx, dy)` from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
