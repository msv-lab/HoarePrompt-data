In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are calculated by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are both -1, and since `x` is initially 0 and `y` is initially 2, the calculations are as follows:

- `nx = x + dx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + (-1) = 1`

Thus, `nx` becomes -1 and `ny` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1.**
