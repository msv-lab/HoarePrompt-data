The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of `ncur` is `A[0 + dx][1 + dy]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[0 + dx][1 + dy]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
