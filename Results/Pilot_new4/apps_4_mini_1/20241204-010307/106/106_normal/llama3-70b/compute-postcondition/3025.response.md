Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 1. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. If these conditions are not met, there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
