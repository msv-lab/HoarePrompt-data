The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The calculations are as follows:

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, where `dx` is -2. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x - 2`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, where `dy` is 1. Therefore, `ny` becomes `y + 1`.

The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the new values of `nx` and `ny`, while maintaining the conditions of the other variables:

- The value of `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- The value of `y` is still 0.
- The value of `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`.
  
Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is `x - 2`; `ny` is 1.**
