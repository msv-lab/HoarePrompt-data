Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable states based on the pieces and their moves. If the loop does not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain initialized to `float('inf')` and `None` respectively, and `queue` remains empty.**
