According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples defined by `dx` and `dy`, which represent the changes in coordinates. The loop will execute again as long as there are more tuples to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` for the first tuple are both -1. The next tuple in the list is `(-1, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` will be updated to -1 and `dy` will be updated to 1.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1**
