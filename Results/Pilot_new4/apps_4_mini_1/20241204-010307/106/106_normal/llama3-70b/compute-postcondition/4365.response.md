According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. Each iteration changes the variables `dx` and `dy` to represent the current direction. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have taken on the values of the last tuple in the list.

Since the loop is set to iterate over four tuples, the next iteration will start from the first tuple again, which is `(-1, 0)`. Thus, `dx` and `dy` will reset to `-1` and `0` respectively.

However, since the loop iterates over the elements in the list directly, and there are no indices being tracked for the loop, there is no need to change any other states such as `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. The state of `N`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` remains unchanged, while only the `dx` and `dy` will revert to the first tuple in the list for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
