Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` is `x + dx` for each `dx` value, and `ny` is `y + dy` for each `dy` value. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
