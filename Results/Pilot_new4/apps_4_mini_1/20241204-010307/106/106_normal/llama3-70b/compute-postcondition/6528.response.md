The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The new value assigned to `dist[1][ncur]` is dependent on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, the index for the distance array is based on the values of `x` and `y`. Other variables remain unchanged, specifically `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`. 

The output state will reflect the updated value for `dist[1][ncur]`, but since we don't have specific values for `dist[1][cur]`, `ncur`, or `dist[1][ncur]`, we cannot express them in numerical terms.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
