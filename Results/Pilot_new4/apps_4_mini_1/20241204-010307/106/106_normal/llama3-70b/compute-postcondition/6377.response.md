The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `queue` contains at least one tuple already, and after the execution of the code, `queue` will contain one additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1) and now also contains (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
