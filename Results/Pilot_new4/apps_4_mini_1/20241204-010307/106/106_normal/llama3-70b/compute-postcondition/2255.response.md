Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `piece` is updated to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur`, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, no changes occur.***
