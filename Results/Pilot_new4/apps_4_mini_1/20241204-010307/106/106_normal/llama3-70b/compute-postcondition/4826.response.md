Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is `x + dx` for `dx` in [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `ny` is `y + dy` for `dy` in [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
