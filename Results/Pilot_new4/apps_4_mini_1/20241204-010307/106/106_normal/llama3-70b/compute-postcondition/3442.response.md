In this situation, we need to consider the assignment made in the code. The code attempts to assign a value to `dist[0][ncur]`, but `ncur` is undefined due to out-of-bounds indexing, which means it cannot be used as a valid index. 

Since `ncur` is undefined, we cannot calculate `dist[0][ncur]`, and thus the program does not change the state of any variables since this operation cannot be performed. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is undefined; `dist[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed due to `ncur` being undefined.**
