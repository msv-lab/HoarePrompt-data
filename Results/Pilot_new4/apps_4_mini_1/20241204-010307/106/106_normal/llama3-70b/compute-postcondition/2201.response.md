Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `queue` now contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
