Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is set to 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, maintaining the original contents of `dist[2]` and `parent[2]`.***
