According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible direction pairs given by `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each pair in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the current values are `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 1. Since the loop will iterate through all direction pairs, after the last iteration, the loop will move to the next pair.

The direction pairs in the list are processed sequentially, so the first pair is `(-1, -1)`, the second `(-1, 1)`, the third `(1, -1)`, and the fourth `(1, 1)`. If the last iteration processed the fourth pair `(1, 1)`, then the loop will not execute again, as all pairs have been processed.

However, if the loop is still set to execute (meaning we have not yet reached the final pair), it will proceed to the next pair based on its position in the list. In this case, if we had just processed the pair `(1, -1)`, the next pair will be `(1, 1)`.

State: **`0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, and the next direction pair will be `(1, 1)`**
