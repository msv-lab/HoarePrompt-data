The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. There is no information about the previous state of `queue`, but it is assumed to exist as a list based on the context.

The values of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `parent` remain unchanged, while the `queue` now contains an additional element, which is the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[1][2]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
