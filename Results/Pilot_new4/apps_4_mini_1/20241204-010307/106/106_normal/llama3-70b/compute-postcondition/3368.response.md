Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist[1]` is updated at index `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and `piece` is equal to 1. The `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, while `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves. The `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` as well as the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Additionally, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` equals `A[-1][1]` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` does not hold, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
