The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. The preconditions state that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array dimensions, specifically between 0 and `N-1`. Therefore, `ncur` will be assigned a valid value from the array based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)` corresponding to valid moves.**
