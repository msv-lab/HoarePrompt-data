Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `dist[2]` reflects the updated shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[2]` reflects the updated parent nodes relevant to valid moves, and `queue` contains tuples of valid moves made during the iterations, which may include multiple tuples of the form `(ncur, 2)`, based on valid moves from the starting position `(x, y)`. If no valid moves were found, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their original states.**
