The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue` list. The variable `ncur` was not assigned due to being out-of-bounds, so its value remains unchanged and invalid. The rest of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` assignment is invalid, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` assignment is invalid, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
