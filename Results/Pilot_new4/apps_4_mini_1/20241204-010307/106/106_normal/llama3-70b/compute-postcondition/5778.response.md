Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, and `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, and `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from `cur` for all updated `ncur` where `piece` is 2, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the values `(cur, piece)` for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 2) for all valid `ncur` that met the distance condition, and the tuple `(cur, i)` is added to `queue`. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for those `ncur`.***
