The code attempts to assign a value to `dist[1][ncur]`, but since `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to the out-of-range index `ny`, this operation cannot proceed. Therefore, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to out-of-range index `ny`, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is still greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
