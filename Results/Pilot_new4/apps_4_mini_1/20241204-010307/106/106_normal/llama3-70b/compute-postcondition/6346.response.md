The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with values from `dx` and `dy`. Since `x` and `y` are both `0`, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend directly on the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Thus, we can express `nx` and `ny` as follows:
- `nx = 0 + dx` 
- `ny = 0 + dy`

The values of `N`, `A`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, and `queue` is updated accordingly for the next iteration.**
