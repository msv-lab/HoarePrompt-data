The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. 

- The value of `x` is 0 and `dx` is -1, so `nx` becomes `0 + (-1) = -1`.
- The value of `y` is 2 and `dy` is -1, so `ny` becomes `2 + (-1) = 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `nx` is now -1
- `ny` is now 1

The range of `N` between 3 and 10, and the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is `A[1][3]`.**
