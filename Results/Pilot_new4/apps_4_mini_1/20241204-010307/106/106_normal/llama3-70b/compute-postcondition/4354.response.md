The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. This action modifies the `queue` variable by appending a new element to it, but it does not affect any of the other variables mentioned.

The values of the other variables remain the same as they were before. The variables `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `ncur`, `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` do not change as a result of this code execution.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` has been modified to include the new tuple, while all other variables retain their original values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 2)`**.
