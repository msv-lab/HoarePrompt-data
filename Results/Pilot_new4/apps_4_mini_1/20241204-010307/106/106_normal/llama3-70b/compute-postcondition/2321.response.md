Postcondition: ***`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains `((ncur, 1),)` appended to its previous contents. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged if the condition is not satisfied.***
