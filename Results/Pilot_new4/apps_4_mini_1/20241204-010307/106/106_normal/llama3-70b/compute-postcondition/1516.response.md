Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `(dx, dy)` is (-2, -1), `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
