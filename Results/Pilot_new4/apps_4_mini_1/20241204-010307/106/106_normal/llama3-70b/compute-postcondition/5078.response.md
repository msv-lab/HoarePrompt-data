Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains valid tuples that were appended during the loop execution, and if no positions were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
