The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The existing state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `piece` is 2; `dist` is initialized to valid distances; `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair and the new pair `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
