The code snippet updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[0][cur]`. The value assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is the previous value of `dist[0][cur]` incremented by 1. However, the specific values of `dist` and `cur` are not provided, so they cannot be explicitly calculated. The impact on the program is that `dist[0][ncur]` will now hold a value that is one greater than the value currently held in `dist[0][cur]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the information about `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` as well.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
