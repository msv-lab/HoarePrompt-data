Postcondition: ***If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` is associated with `parent[0][ncur]`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, the values of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
