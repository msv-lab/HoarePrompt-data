Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for piece 2, `parent[2]` tracks the previous position and piece for each reachable position for piece 2, and `queue` contains `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, there are no changes to `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remains empty.***
