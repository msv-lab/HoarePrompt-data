Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes to the values.***
