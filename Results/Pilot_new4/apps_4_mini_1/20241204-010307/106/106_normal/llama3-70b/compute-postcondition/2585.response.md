The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, ensuring they are valid indexes for the array `A`. Therefore, `ncur` will now hold the value from the array `A` at the specified indices.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so we will represent `ncur` in terms of previously defined variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
