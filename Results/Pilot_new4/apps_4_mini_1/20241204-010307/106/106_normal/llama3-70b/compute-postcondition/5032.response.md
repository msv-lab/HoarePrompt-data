Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
