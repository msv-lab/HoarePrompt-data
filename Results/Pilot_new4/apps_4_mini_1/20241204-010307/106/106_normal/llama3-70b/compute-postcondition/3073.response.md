The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which indicates that the current distance from the starting point has now been updated to a lesser value. 

The state of the other variables remains unaffected, so the output state consists of the updated distance.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `nx` is between 0 and `N`, the current value of `ny` is between 0 and `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
