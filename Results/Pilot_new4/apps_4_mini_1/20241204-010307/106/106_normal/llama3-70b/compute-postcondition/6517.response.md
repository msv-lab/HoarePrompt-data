To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the provided conditions and the loop behavior.

The loop iterates over four pairs of `(dx, dy)`, specifically: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. After each iteration, the loop will proceed to the next pair of `(dx, dy)`.

Since the loop has not yet executed for the last pair `(1, 1)`, we need to adjust the states accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. 

1. The loop has already processed three pairs so far.
2. For the loop to execute again, it must move to the next pair, which is `(1, 1)`.

Thus, we need to indicate that the next state of the loop has processed three pairs of `(dx, dy)`, and is about to process the fourth:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` where `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and the next `(dx, dy)` pair being processed is `(1, 1)`**.
