The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the existing value of `dist[0][cur]`. Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, we can determine that `dist[0][ncur]` will be assigned the value `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

The relevant variables are:
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated.
- `dist[0][cur]` remains the same.

Since `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 10, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the output state will reflect the update to `dist[0][ncur]` without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
