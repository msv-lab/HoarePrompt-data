The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are not directly altered by this operation; rather, a new tuple is created and added to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new addition to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
