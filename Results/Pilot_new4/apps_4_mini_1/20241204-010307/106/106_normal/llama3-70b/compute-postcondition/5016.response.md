In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the existing values of `x` and `y`, with the addition of `dx` and `dy` respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, therefore they can be considered as unknowns.

Given the initial values:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 0

So, we can express `nx` and `ny` as:
- `nx = 3 + dx`
- `ny = 0 + dy`

The output state retains the initial variable values while updating `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is 3 + `dx`; `ny` is `dy`.**
