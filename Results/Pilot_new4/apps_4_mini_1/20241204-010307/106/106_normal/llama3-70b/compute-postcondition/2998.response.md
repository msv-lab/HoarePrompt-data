Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the new tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
