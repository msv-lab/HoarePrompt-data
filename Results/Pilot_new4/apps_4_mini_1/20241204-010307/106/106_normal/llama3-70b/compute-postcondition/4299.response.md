The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, but now `parent[0][ncur]` has been updated to hold a tuple of `(cur, piece)`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
