The `nx` and `ny` variables are assigned the values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values for `x` and `y` are unknown, but `dx` and `dy` are determined by the last movement, which is given as `(0, 1)`. This implies that `dx` is `0` and `dy` is `1`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + 0` (which simplifies to `x`) and `ny` becomes `y + 1`. 

The values of `N`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` reflect the following states after the execution:

- `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10.
- `piece` is 2.
- `nx` is equal to `x`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1**.
