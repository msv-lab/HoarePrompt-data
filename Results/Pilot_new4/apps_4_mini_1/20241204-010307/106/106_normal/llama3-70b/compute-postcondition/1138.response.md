Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
