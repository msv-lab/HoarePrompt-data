The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. Given that `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`, we can directly substitute these values into the code. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `-2` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-2][1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is 1, we summarize the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`.**
