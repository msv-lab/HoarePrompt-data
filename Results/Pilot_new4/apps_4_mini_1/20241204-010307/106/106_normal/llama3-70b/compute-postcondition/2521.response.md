The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is the addition of a new item to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
