The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N-1 (inclusive), so they are valid indices for accessing `A`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, only `ncur` is now defined.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that were updated during the loop, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
