The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

The initial state mentions that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but the specific value of `cur` and `piece` is not provided. Therefore, we only know that `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to the combination of these two variables.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now a combination of `cur` and `piece`.**
