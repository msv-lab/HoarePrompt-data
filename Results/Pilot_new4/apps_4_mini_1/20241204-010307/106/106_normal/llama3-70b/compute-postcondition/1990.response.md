The assignment `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` indicates that the distance at index `ncur` for the second piece in the `dist` array is updated based on the distance at index `cur`, incremented by 1. Given the precondition that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, it implies that the existing value at `dist[2][ncur]` must be changed to a smaller value.

The other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) remain unchanged in this execution. 

Thus, after the code is executed, the relevant updates are:
- `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur]` now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices; `piece` is 2; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
