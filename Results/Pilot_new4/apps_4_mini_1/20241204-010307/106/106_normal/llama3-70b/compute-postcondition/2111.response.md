The code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is changed to be the value of `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices,
- `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices,
- `piece` is determined by the loop (but remains 0),
- `queue` contains valid tuples,
- `N` is greater than 0,
- `y` is 0,
- the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy` within the bounds of the matrix (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N),
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`,
- `piece` is 0,
- the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

After the execution of the statement, the only variable that has changed is `dist[0][ncur]`. The new value of `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is 0, `queue` contains valid tuples, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy` within the bounds of the matrix (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
