Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]` plus 1, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`.***
