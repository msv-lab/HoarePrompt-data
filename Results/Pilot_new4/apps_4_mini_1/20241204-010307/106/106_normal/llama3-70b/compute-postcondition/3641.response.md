The code updates the `dist` array at index `[1][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value at `dist[1][cur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are not affected. However, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` becomes equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1**.
