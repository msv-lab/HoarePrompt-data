The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added to the queue, but no other variables are affected by this operation.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes all the valid conditions from the initial state and indicates that `ncur` and `2` have been appended to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 0 and N-1; `dist` is updated such that `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid tuples and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `piece` is greater than 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`.**
