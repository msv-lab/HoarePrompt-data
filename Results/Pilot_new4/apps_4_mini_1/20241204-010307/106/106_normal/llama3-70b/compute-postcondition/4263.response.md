Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
