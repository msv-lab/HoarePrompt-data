The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial state provides that `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions for valid indices within the bounds of the array `A`. Thus, `ncur` will take the value from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`, which is valid based on the provided precondition. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
