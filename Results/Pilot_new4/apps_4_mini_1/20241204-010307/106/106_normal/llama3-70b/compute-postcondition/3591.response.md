Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are updated such that if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance for each position reachable by the piece, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the last position reached before `ncur`, and `queue` includes the newly added tuple `(cur, i)` for reachable positions. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, including `dist[0][cur]` for any unreachable positions.***
