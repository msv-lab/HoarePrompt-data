The code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which indicates that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` will now be updated to a smaller value. 

- Before the operation, we have:
  - `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.
- After the operation, `dist[1][ncur]` will be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Since the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, we will include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent` corresponds to those reachable positions, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
