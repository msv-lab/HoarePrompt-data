The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is `0` and `dy` is `-1`, `ny` will become `y - 1`. `nx` remains equal to `x`. Therefore, the updated values are `nx = x` and `ny = y - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1**.
