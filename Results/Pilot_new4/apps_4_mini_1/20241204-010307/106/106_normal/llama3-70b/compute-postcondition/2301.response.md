The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not changed or modified in any way, but the `queue` is updated to include the new tuple.

The values of `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain as specified with `nx` being equal to `x + dx`, `ny` being equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` being equal to `A[nx][ny]`. 

The `parent[0][ncur]` is still `cur, piece`, and no other variables were affected.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
