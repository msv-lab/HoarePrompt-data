According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing direction changes `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute four times as there are four elements in the list. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:

- `N` is between 3 and 10 (indicating that it can be considered valid).
- `y` is 0.
- `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`.
- `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`.
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`.
- `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`.
- `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`.
- `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and it must not be empty.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Given that the loop iterates over the list of direction changes, after the last iteration, the values `(dx, dy)` would have already taken on the last pair `(1, 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to start over from the first pair `(-1, -1)`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to account for the next iteration starting back at the first element of the list. The loop can technically run again, and it will repeat the same pairs, so we will restate the conditions for the next complete iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, -1)` for the next iteration.**
