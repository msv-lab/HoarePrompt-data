The value `ncur` is assigned previously and now it is appended to the `queue` with the value `0`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged after this operation. The value of `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
