To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to examine the states provided and the loop itself.

1. The loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing direction changes (`dx, dy`). This means that the loop will always execute as long as there are no constraints on the loop itself, since the list contains 8 pairs of directions.

2. The variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are mentioned to retain their prior values, indicating that they are already defined and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

3. The state before the loop starts mentions that `N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, and `y` is equal to `N`. This means that `y` will also be a valid integer in that range.

4. The condition `A[x][y] = cur` implies that the two-dimensional array `A` has a specific element at coordinates `[x][y]`, where `y` is within the defined range based on the value of `N`.

Given these points, the essential states to ensure for the loop to execute are:

- The array `A` must exist and have a valid size to accommodate the index `[x][y]`, where `y` (equal to `N`) is within the limits of the array bounds.
- The variable `cur` should also be properly defined, as it appears in the condition of accessing `A`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, and `cur` is defined**.
