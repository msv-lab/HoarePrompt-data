The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned as follows: `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Given the initial state, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. Therefore, `ny` becomes `0 - 1`, resulting in `ny` being -1. The value of `nx` depends on the value of `x`, which is not specified but will be decremented by 2 because of `dx`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values for `nx` and `ny`, while maintaining the previous state information.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1**
