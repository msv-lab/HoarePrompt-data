Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece` is maintained, while `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
