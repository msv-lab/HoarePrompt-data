Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` as well as all valid moves `(ncur, 1)`. Additionally, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`.***
