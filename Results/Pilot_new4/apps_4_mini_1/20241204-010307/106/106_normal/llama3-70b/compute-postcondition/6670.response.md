The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and 0 to the list `queue`. The value of `ncur` is already determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the current states of `nx` and `ny`. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is -1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `-1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are also defined, but their specific values are not provided or modified by the code snippet.

The impact of the code is that the `queue` variable now contains an additional tuple. The other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
