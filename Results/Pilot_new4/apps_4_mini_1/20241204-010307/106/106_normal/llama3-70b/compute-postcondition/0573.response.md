The value of `ncur` is assigned from the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined as `x - 1` and `-1` respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value of `A[x - 1][-1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][-1]`.**
