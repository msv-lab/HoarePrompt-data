The variable `A` is reassigned to a new 2D list generated by taking `N` input lines, where each line consists of integers converted from string input. The initial state indicates that `A` was a 2D list of distinct integers, and now it will be populated based on user input. The value of `N` remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that `A` is now a 2D list formed from the distinct integers provided as input, corresponding to `N` rows of data.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `A` is a 2D list of distinct integers based on input with N rows.**
