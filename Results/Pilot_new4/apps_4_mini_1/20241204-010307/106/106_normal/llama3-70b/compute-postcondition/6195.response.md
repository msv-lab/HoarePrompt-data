The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `dx`, and `y`, `dy`. The previous values are `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1. After executing the line, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which translates to `x + 1`, and `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which results in `1 + 0`, equating to `1`. Thus, both `nx` and `ny` retain their values from before the execution.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `N` is still between 3 and 10, `y` is still 1, `dx` is still 1, `dy` is still 0, and `ncur` is still `A[x + 1][1]`, but we have confirmed that `nx` remains as `x + 1` and `ny` is still 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1**
