Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[5][2]`; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
