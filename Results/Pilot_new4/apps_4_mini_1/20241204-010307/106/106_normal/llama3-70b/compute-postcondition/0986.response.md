Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, or `queue`.***
