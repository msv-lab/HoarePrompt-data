The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this update implies that the distance to `ncur` from the second piece (represented by the index 2) is now adjusted to be one unit more than the distance to `cur`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` represents the previous positions leading to each `ncur`, `queue` contains all updated reachable positions from `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N - 1` inclusive, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.
