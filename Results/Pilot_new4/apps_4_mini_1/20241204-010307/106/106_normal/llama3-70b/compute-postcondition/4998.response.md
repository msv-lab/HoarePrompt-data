The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variable `x` is currently `3`, and `y` is `0`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, but it is ensured that `nx` and `ny` will be valid positions based on the conditions defined for `A`. The states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `A`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `nx` is `3 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions, `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains all valid tuples, `A` must be defined such that `0 <= x + dx < N` and `0 <= y + dy < M for all (dx, dy)`**.
