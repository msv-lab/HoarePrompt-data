The code updates the `dist` array at index `[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables `N`, `piece`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` do not change in this operation. However, `dist[0][ncur]` is now defined as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The exact values of `dist[0][cur]` and `dist[0][ncur]` depend on the current state of the program, but since we know that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, we will reference it.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
