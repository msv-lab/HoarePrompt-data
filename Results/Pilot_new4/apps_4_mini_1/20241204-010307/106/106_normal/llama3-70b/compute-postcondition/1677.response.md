The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing variable `queue`. The variable `queue` itself is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is assumed to have been defined previously. The values of `ncur` and `0` are directly inserted into the queue.

The initial conditions remain valid, and no other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` has been appended to `queue`.**
