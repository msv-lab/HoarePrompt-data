The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values for `ncur` and `2` are used directly as they are. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**
