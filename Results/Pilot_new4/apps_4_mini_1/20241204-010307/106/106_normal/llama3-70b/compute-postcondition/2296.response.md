According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible movements `(dx, dy)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next tuple in the list of movements.

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have information about which tuple was processed since the loop body is omitted. However, we know that the loop goes through all 8 tuples in the list. If we denote the current iteration index as `i` (starting from 0), at the end of the last iteration, `i` should be 0 through 7. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next index.

Thus, if we assume that the loop has executed for the last tuple `(2, 1)`, the loop index would have been at 7. Therefore, to execute one more time, we would expect the next index to be 8, which is out of bounds for the list of tuples.

Given that the loop runs until it has processed all elements in the list, if the loop has not yet processed all 8 tuples, the next tuple needs to be prepared for processing.

State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged, `dx` and `dy` must correspond to the next tuple to be processed from the list of movements, which will index to the next available movement tuple after the last processed one.**
