The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `parent` and `cur` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, which depends on the specific value of `x`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
