The code updates the distance at index `ncur` for the second layer of the `dist` array. The new value for `dist[2][ncur]` is calculated as the current distance for `cur` in the second layer of `dist` plus 1. Therefore, it takes the previous value of `dist[2][cur]` and increments it by 1.

The state of `dist` is affected, specifically `dist[2][ncur]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
