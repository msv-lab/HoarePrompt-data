Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)` based on the knight's moves, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions.**
