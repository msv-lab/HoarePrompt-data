Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` are from the set {(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)}. After all iterations of the loop, `dist` may be updated for some indices based on the conditions provided, `parent` may be updated accordingly for valid indices, and `queue` may contain tuples representing new valid states. If none of the conditions are met during any iteration, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
