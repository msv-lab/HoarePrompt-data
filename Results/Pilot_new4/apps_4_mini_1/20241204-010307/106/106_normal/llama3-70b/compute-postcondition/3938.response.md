Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, the valid position `(cur, i)` is appended to `queue`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to reflect the shortest distances for valid positions reachable from the starting position `(x, y)` based on piece type being 2, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to contain the parent references for those positions.***
