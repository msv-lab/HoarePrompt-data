According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples defining changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The execution of the loop depends on the number of tuples available in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will hold the values of the last tuple processed.

The list contains 8 pairs of `(dx, dy)`, and if we denote the current index in the loop by `k`, the loop needs to adjust `k` to point to the next tuple for the next iteration. Given that there are 8 pairs, at the end of the last iteration, `k` must be 7, and for the next iteration, `k` must be incremented to 8.

Since the loop will stop executing when `k` reaches 8 (which is beyond the last index), for it to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the list of tuples allows for one more iteration. However, since the loop will terminate after reaching the last tuple, there will not be a next iteration.

Therefore, since the loop cannot execute one more time with the current configuration, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the new tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and the loop has completed all iterations with `dx` and `dy` being the last processed values from the list.**
