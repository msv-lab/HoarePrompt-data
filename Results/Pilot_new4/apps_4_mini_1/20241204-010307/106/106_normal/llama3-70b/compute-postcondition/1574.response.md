The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged, but `queue` now contains an additional tuple. The states of the other variables remain valid as stated in the initial state. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains all tuples of valid `ncur` values where the piece is 2 plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
