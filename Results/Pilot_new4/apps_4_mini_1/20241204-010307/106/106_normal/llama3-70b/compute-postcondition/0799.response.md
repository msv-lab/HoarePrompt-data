The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are both initialized to 0. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nx` and `ny` are dependent on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and the value of A[0][0] is equal to `cur`.**
