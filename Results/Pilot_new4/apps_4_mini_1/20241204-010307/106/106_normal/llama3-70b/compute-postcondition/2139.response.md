The assignment `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. The variable `parent[1][ncur]` will now store a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The precondition states that `dist[1][ncur]` was updated previously and is valid, and since there are no constraints that affect the other variables in the output state, all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is currently 1, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than this new value, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now (cur, piece)**.
