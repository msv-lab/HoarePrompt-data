Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`.***
