Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive). If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), and if `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` is updated to contain tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for each valid move that met the conditions. Additionally, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
