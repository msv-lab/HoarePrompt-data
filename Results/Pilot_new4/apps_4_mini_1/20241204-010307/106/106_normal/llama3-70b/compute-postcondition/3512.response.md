The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` will now equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged.**
