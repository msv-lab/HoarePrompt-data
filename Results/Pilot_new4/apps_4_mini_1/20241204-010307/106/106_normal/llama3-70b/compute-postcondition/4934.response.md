Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and N-2, `nx` varies as `x + dx` for each `dx`, `ny` varies as `y + dy` for each `dy`. For each valid `(nx, ny)` within the bounds [0, N), `ncur` takes the values from `A[nx][ny]` corresponding to those positions. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`. The `queue` contains tuples of all `ncur` values processed, each paired with `0`. If any conditions for updating were not met during any iteration, no changes were made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.**
