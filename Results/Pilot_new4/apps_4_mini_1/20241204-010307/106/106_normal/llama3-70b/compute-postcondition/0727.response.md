The code statement updates the `dist` array at the index `[0][ncur]`. The value assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is calculated by adding 1 to the value of `dist[0][cur]`. The variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged after this operation, but we must consider that `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it exists in context.

The output state reflects that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since `cur` is not specified, we cannot provide its value, but we can express the output state based on the relationship established.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
