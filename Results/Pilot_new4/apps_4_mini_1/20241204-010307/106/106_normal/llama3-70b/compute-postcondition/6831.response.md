In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `x` must be between 2 and `N-1`, and `y` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, but this does not affect the calculations for `nx` and `ny`.

Since `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, adding `dx` will yield a new value for `nx`, while adding `dy` to `0` will yield a new value for `ny`. 

The exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined without knowing `dx` and `dy`, so the output will reflect that they are new values based on the calculations.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`**.
