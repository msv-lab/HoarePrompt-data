The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the two-dimensional array `parent` at the indices `1` and `ncur`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, while `piece` remains equal to `1`. The states of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, and the `dist` array remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
