The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. Specifically, it assigns to `dist[0][ncur]` the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10` (this condition remains valid),
- `y` is 0 (this condition remains valid),
- `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur` (this condition remains valid),
- `dx` is -1 (this condition remains valid),
- `dy` is -2 (this condition remains valid),
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1` (this condition remains valid),
- `ny` is -2 (this condition remains valid),
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-2]` (this condition remains valid).

The specific value of `dist[0][ncur]` will change, and it will become `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
