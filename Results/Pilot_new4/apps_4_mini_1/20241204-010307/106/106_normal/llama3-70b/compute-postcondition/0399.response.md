The code snippet updates the `dist` array at position `[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of the current `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. The variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist` are involved in this operation. The specific values of `ncur` and `cur` are derived from the initial conditions, but `cur` is not specified in the initial state.

Given:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`

After the operation, we have:
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

The states of other variables remain unchanged, and since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we can't specify its value. However, we can express the update generically.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
