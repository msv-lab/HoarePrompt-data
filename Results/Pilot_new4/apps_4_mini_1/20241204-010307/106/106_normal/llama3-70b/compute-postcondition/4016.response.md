Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` contains the additional position `(ncur, 2)`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur` and `piece`. Otherwise, none of these updates take place.***
