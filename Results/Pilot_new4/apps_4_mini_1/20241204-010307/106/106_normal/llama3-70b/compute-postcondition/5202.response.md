The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variables being affected are `parent`, `ncur`, and `piece`. The other variables maintain their values as before. 

The `parent` array now contains new information at the index `[1][ncur]`, which represents the position of a specific node (given by `ncur`) and the piece associated with it.

Thus, the updated output state is:
- `N` is between 4 and 10
- `x` is between 0 and N-1
- `y` is between 1 and N-1
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to 1
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`
- `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`**
