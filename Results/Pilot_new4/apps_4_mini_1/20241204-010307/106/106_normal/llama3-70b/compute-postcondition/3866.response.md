To analyze the given code snippet, we need to understand what changes it introduces given the initial state:

Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.

The code:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

In this snippet, `ncur` is assigned a value from a 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. 

However, `dx` and `dy` are not mentioned in the initial state, which means they can take any value. Thus, `nx` and `ny` can also vary based on the values of `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, we cannot specify exact values for `nx` and `ny` without knowing `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `ncur` is being assigned a value from the array `A`, the initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid, but we add the assignment of `ncur` based on the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Thus, the Output State will include the unchanged values and the assignment of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**.
