Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position to all valid `ncur` positions if piece is 2 and valid moves exist, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the previous position and piece type for all reachable `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 2)` and now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`; if no valid moves exist, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
