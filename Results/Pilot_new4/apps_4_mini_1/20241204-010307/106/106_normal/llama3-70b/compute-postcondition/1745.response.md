The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variables `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged, while the value `dist[2][ncur]` is now dependent on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`. Thus, the other variables and their ranges are still valid. 

Output State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
