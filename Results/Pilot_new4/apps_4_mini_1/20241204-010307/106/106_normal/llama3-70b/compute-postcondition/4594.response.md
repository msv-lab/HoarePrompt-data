The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns `dist[1][ncur]` the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know that `dist[1][ncur]` is currently greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Therefore, we can conclude that after this assignment, `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which will make it equal to or less than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
