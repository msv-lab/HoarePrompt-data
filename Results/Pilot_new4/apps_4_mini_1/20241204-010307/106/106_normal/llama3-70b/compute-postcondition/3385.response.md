Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(x, y)` considering knight moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the associated parent positions for each updated `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` retains the updated parent positions based on the knight's moves, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` along with all newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move executed. If no valid moves occur, then the state of the variables remains unchanged with respect to these variables.**
