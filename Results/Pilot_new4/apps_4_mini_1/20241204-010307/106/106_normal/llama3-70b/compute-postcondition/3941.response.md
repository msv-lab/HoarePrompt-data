According to the code, the condition for the loop to execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` contains elements (i.e., it is not empty), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is still not specified to be empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, no adjustments are necessary as long as `queue` is not empty.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the minimum distances from the original position to all reachable positions based on piece types, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `cur` is the value of the last processed piece, and `piece` is the type of the last processed piece**
