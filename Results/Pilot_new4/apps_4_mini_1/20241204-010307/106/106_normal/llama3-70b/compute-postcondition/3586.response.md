Postcondition: ***`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the distances or parent array.***
