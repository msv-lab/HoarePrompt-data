The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `queue` are the only variables affected by this operation.

The initial state indicates that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is `2 + dx`
- `ny` is `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[2][ncur]` is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`

The value of `ncur` is derived from the array `A`, and it is not specified but remains unchanged in this operation. The operation simply adds a new element to the `queue`.

Thus, the output state should reflect the unchanged values along with the updated state of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
