The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is the result of the expression `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dist[1][ncur]` will now be equal to the value of `dist[1][cur]` increased by 1.

Since `dist[1][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it indicates that the prior value of `dist[1][ncur]` was more than one greater than `dist[1][cur]`, and now it is adjusted to be exactly one more than `dist[1][cur]`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects the new value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
