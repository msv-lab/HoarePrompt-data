Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which is `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the variables.***
