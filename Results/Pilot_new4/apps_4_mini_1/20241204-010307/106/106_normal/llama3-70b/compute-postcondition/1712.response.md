The line `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables involved in this operation are `ncur`, which is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, and the constant `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
