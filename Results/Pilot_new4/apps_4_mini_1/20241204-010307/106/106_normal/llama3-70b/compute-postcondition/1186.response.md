The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]` using the combination of the variables `cur` and `piece`. The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[1][ncur]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected. We will denote that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1 + `dx`; `ny` is 1 + `dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
