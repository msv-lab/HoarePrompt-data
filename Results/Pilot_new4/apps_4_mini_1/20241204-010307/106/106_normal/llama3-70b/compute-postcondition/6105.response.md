The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that variables like `ncur`, `piece`, and `queue` are set up and have valid values. The other variables remain unchanged by this operation.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `piece` is equal to 2, the tuple that gets appended is specific.

The values of the relevant variables are unchanged except for the `queue`, which will now contain the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` represents the previous positions leading to each `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N - 1` inclusive, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to its previous contents.**
