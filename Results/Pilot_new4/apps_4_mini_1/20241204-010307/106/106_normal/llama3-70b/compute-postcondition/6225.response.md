Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
