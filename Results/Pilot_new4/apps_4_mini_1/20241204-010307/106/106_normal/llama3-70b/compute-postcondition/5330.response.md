According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], meaning it will execute a total of four times, once for each tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 4, and it has gone through one of the tuples from the list. 

Since `x` is 4 and the loop has not yet completed all iterations, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the next tuple in the list. The current iteration must be considered; thus `dx` and `dy` will be the second tuple, which is `(1, 0)`.

After this iteration, the loop will execute again for the third tuple `(0, -1)`. Therefore, no changes need to be made to `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, or `dist`, as these variables remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + 1`; `ny` is equal to `-1`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`.**
