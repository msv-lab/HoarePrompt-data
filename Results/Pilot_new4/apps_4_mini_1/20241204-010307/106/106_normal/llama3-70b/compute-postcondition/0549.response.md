The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which indicates it holds a specific value depending on the array `A` and the indices `nx` and `ny`, the state of `queue` will reflect this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
