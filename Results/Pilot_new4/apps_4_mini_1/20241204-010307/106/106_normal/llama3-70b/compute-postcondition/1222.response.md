The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged as the code only modifies the `queue`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of (cur, piece); `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
