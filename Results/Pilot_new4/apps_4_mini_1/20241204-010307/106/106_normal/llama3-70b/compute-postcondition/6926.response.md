According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. There are 8 tuples in total, so for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current iteration index and ensure it is less than 8.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, meaning it is the first piece that has been processed in the previous iteration. The variable `y` does not change within the for loop, and therefore remains constant throughout.

The index corresponding to the current tuple within the loop will be incremented with each iteration. Since there are 8 pairs in the list, when the loop reaches the last pair (index 7), it will not execute again. 

Given that we want to set the state for the next iteration, we need to keep in mind that the loop would next process the tuple at index 8, which does not exist. Thus, we need to represent `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration as the next index (which is out of bounds) and adjust the iteration count accordingly.

Therefore, since there is no additional iteration possible for the next step, we can state that:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and the loop index is 8 (end of the range)**
