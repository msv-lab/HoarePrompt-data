According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the list of tuples representing the offsets `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples, and in the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `y` is 1. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` takes the next values from the list of offsets on each iteration.

The list of offsets has 8 pairs, which means that the loop can be executed a total of 8 times. Since the current iteration is the first one with `(dx, dy)` equal to `(-2, -1)`, the next values of `(dx, dy)` will be `(-2, 1)`, `(-1, -2)`, `(-1, 2)`, `(1, -2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, -1)`, and `(2, 1)` in subsequent iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and the loop has executed for the first offset `(-2, -1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it will proceed to the next offset, which is `(-2, 1)`.

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `x` will be updated to `1 + (-2)`, which results in `x` being `-1`.
- `y` will be updated to `1 + 1`, which results in `y` being `2`.

However, since `x` must remain within the bounds of `0` to `N-1` (where `N` is between 3 and 10), the new value of `x` being `-1` will not satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary to note that this specific update leads to an invalid state.

In summary, since the loop is moving to the next tuple in the list, the values of `x` and `y` will be adjusted as such:

State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is -1, `y` is 2**
