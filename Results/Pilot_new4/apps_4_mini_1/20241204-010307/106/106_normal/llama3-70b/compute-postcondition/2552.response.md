The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the array `parent` at the index `[0][ncur]`. The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to hold a tuple of `(cur, piece)`, which is now a pair of values. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The previous conditions still hold, including:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is an integer such that `y` is less than `N` and has been incremented to `y + 1`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to `0`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur]` is still valid.

Therefore, the output state reflects only the change made by the assignment to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `y` is less than `N` and has been incremented to `y + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur]` is still valid, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
