Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop executes normally, all valid neighboring positions are explored, and the distances and parent references are updated as needed based on the conditions met during execution.***
