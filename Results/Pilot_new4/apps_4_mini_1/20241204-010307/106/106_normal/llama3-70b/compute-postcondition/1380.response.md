The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `parent` and `cur` are not given, but we know that `piece` is equal to `2`. 

Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to the tuple `(cur, 2)`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
