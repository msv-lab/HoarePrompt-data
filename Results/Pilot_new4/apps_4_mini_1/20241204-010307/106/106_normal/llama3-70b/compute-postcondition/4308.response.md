The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables in the initial state are changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `ncur` to the `queue`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and `ncur` has been appended to `queue` along with `0`.**
