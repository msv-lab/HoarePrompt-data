Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, `piece` is 0; `nx` is 1 + `dx`, and `ny` is 2 + `dy`. The current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1 inclusive, and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1 inclusive.***
