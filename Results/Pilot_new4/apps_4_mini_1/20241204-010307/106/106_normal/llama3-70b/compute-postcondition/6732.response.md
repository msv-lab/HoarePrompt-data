The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The states of `ncur` and `queue` are affected by this operation. `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
