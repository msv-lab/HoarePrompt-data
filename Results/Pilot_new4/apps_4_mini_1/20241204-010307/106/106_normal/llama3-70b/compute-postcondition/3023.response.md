The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value assigned is the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged, but `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to this new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
