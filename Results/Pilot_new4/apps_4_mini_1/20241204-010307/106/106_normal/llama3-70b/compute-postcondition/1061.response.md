Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist` reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations. The current values of `nx` and `ny` fall within the bounds such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, and `nx` and `ny` are both less than `N`.***
