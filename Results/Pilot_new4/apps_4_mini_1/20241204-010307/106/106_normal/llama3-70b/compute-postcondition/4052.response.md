The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are both equal to -1, and thus `ncur` is set to `A[-1][-1]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]**.
