The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. 

The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `queue` now contains the new tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
