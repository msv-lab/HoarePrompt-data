Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the final minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on the types of pieces processed, `parent` contains the final predecessor information for each reachable position, and `queue` includes all reachable points processed based on the moves defined for the pieces. If no valid moves were possible during the loop execution, `dist` and `parent` may remain unchanged from their initial states.**
