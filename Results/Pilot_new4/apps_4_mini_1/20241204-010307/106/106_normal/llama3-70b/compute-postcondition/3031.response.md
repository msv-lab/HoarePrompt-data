The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`**.
