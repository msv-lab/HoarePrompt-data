The code snippet adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The initial values of the variables do not change as a result of this operation, but the `queue` is updated to include the new tuple. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
