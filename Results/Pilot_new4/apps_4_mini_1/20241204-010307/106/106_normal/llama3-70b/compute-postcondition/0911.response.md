According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the iterable `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This iterable contains four pairs of deltas (dx, dy), which are fixed and ensure that the loop will execute exactly four times regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. 

Since the states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` do not affect the execution of this specific loop directly, they do not require any adjustments for the loop itself to execute. The loop will execute with the defined deltas as long as the structure of the loop is intact.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged regarding the loop execution, but we can clarify that the loop will iterate over the four pairs of deltas.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid moves from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been set for valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all reachable cells from `(x, y)`, and will execute for each of the 4 deltas**
