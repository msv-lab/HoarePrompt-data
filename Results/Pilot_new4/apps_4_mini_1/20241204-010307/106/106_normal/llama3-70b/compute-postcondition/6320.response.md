The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively, which have not been defined in the initial state but are assumed to be valid indices within the bounds of the array `A`. The initial conditions state that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `ncur` will now hold the value of the element in the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
