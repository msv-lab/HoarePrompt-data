The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is `x + 1`, and `ny` is `0`. Since `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, the specific entry in the array `A` is accessed at the position `[nx][ny]`, which translates to `[x + 1][0]`. 

The initial state specifies the constraints for `N`, which does not directly impact the assignment of `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`.**
