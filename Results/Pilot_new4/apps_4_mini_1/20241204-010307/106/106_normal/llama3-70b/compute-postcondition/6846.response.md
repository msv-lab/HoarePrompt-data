Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, with no modifications to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
