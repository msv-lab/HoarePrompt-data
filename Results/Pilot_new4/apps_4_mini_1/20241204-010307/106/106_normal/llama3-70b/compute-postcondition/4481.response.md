The line `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current value at `dist[0][cur]`. Since `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, we know that:

- `dist[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
