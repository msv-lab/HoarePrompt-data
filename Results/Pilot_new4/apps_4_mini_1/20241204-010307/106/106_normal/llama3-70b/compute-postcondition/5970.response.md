The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are used directly from the initial state, while other variables remain unchanged. 

The affecting variables are:
- `ncur`, which is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

No other state changes occur, and the states of the remaining variables are retained as previously mentioned.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
