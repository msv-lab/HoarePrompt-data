The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the variable `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state but are retained in the output state. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
