Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` remains unchanged, and if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to N-1, `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not met, there are no changes in the state.***
