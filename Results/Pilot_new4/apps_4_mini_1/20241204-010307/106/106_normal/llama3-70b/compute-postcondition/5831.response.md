Output State: **If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and possibly also `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
