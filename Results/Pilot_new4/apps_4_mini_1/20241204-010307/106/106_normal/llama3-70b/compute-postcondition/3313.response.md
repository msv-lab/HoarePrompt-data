The line of code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. This means that if `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged, then `dist[2][ncur]` will become one greater than its previous value. In the initial state, `dist[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][cur]` are not specifically defined, so we cannot determine their exact values, but we know `dist[2][ncur]` changes as a result.

The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, but since we have no specifics for `A`, `nx`, or `ny`, we leave that as is. The other variables, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state retains all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has executed, with the updated value for `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` will have no changes unless the condition holds true, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
