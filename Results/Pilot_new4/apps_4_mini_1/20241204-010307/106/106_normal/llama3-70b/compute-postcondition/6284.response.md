In the given code snippet, the statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The value of `cur` was previously defined but does not change during this operation. The other variables' states remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
