The `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]`, and while `cur` is not specified in the initial state, it is assumed to have a defined value at runtime. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`.**
