The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`, which are within bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to the value of the matrix `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
