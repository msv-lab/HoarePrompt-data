According to the code, the for loop iterates over the directional changes defined in the list `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which represents movements in four possible directions (up, down, left, right). At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already gone through one of these directional changes.

Since the loop iterates over a fixed list of four tuples, the loop can execute one more time until all tuples have been processed. After the last iteration, if the loop has processed one direction (let's assume it was the first tuple `(-1, 0)`), the next tuple that will be processed is `(1, 0)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be updated accordingly to reflect that the next direction tuple to be processed will be `(1, 0)`.

State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and the next direction to be processed is `(1, 0)`**
