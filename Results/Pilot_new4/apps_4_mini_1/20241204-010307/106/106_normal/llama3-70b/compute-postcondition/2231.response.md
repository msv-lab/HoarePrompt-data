The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `ncur` is getting its value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`, the specific value of `ncur` will depend on the contents of `A` at those indices, which is not provided. However, since `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, we can assume that it will be valid for those updates.

Other variables such as `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `piece` is 0, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, `dist` and `parent` reflect the initial state, and `queue` reflects the initial state.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `dist` reflects the initial state, `parent` reflects the initial state, `queue` reflects the initial state**.
