The code appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and 1 to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
