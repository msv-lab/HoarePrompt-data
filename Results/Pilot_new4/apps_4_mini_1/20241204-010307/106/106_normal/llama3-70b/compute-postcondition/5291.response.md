In the provided code snippet, we are trying to assign values to `parent[1][ncur]`. However, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to an out-of-range index `ny`, and we do not have a current value for `cur`. This means that we cannot effectively perform the assignment operation. Therefore, no changes occur to any variables, including `parent`, and the output remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to out-of-range index `ny`, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is still greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1; no changes have been made.**
