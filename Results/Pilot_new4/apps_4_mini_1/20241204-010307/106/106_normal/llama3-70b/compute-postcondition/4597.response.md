Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements and `(ncur, 1)`; and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
