The `queue` variable is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to it. The values of `dist`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to its previous values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
