The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. The previous values are `x = 0`, `dx = -2`, and `y = 0`, `dy = 1`. 

Calculating the new values:
- `nx` becomes `0 + (-2)`, which is `-2`.
- `ny` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

The final output state is: 
`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
