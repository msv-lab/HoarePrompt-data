The code calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unaffected by this operation. 

`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updates to `nx` and `ny` based on the additions.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `piece` must be less than or equal to `n`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
