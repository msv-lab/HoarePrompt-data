The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which is calculated as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The initial value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, therefore, after this assignment, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
