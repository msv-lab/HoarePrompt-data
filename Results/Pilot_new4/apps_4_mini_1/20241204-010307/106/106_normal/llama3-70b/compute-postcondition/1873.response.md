The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The new values of `nx` and `ny` will be equal to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial conditions state that `x` and `y` are valid indices, therefore `nx` and `ny` must also be valid indices as a result of the operations performed. The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
