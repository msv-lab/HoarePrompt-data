The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. This means that `parent[1][ncur]` will now hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment made to `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 1)`**.
