The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][N + 1]`, and the value of `2` is constant. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` now contains an additional element, specifically the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions including (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][N + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
