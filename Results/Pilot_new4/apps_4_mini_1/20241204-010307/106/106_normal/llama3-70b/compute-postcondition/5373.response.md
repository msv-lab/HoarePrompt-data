Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, `queue` contains valid tuples for the current position and piece, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N).***
