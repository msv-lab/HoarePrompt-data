Output State: **`piece` is 1 or 2, `dist[2]` contains the shortest path distances from `cur` for `piece` 2, `parent[2]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices with `piece` 2, and `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves. If no valid moves were possible, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
