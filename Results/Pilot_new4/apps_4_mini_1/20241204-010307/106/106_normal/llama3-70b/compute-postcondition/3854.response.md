According to the code, the for loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing the pairs (dx, dy). Since this list is predefined and has 8 elements, the loop will always execute 8 times regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the current states of `N`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

However, it is important to note the initial values of `x` and `y` if they are used within the loop body. If the loop body uses `x` and `y`, we may consider their initial states.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can summarize that the values of `N`, `x`, and `y` can remain unchanged. The loop will execute as it is based solely on the provided list of pairs.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2**
