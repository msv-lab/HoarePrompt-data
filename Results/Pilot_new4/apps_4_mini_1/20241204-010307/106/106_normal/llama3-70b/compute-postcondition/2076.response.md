The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The condition holds true, indicating that the new distance for index `ncur` is now one greater than the distance for `cur`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur]` now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
