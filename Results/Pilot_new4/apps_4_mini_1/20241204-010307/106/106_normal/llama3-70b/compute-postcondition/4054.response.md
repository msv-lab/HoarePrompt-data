The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]`. The variable `piece` is also assigned in this context. The initial state does not affect the other variables, and we assume `cur` and `piece` have been defined previously in the code. 

Since `ncur` is derived from `A[-1][-1]`, we cannot determine its value from the given initial conditions. However, the assignment of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` indicates that `parent[0][ncur]` will hold the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]; `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
