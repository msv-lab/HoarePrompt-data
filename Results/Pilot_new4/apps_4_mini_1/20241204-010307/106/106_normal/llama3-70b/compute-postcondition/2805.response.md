Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate which will be `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of each reachable position with their corresponding piece values, and `queue` contains the previous tuples of reachable positions with piece value 2 plus the new tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.***
