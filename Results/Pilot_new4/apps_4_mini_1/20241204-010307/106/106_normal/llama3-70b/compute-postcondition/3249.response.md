The value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `x` and `y` with added values `dx` and `dy` respectively, we remain within the bounds of the array `A`, which is confirmed by the initial conditions. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged as the assignment does not alter them.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
