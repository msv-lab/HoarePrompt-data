The code computes new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `(x, y)` using the values in `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, but they represent the possible knight moves in a chess game. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the current values of `x` and `y` adjusted by the respective `dx` and `dy`.

Since `x` and `y` are both initialized to `0`, the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` will directly reflect the sum of `0` and the values from `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions.**
