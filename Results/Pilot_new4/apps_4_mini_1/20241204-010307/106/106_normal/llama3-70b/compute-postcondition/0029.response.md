Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (1, 0), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
