According to the code, the for loop iterates over the set of direction tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as these variables do not affect the execution of the for loop itself.

Thus, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute. The loop will iterate four times with the predefined direction tuples, and the internal logic of the loop body will handle the current state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values, `queue` contains all reachable `ncur` values along with the value 1.**
