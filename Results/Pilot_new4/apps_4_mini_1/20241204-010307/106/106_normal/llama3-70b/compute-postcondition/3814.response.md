The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions provided. The new values will be calculated as follows:

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`.

However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new values for `nx` and `ny`. The output state will reflect the updates to `nx` and `ny` in terms of the unknown variables `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the output state is as follows, maintaining the conditions of the other variables:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`**
