The provided code snippet assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but `ncur` has been assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which is based on the computed values of `nx` and `ny`. 

The initial values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the formulas `nx = 1 + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`, which means their exact values depend on the unknown variables `dx` and `dy`. 

However, we know:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.
- `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated based on previous values.

The operation updates the `parent` structure but does not modify the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, or `ncur`. 

Since `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state and their values are not known, we can only state that `parent[1][ncur]` now holds the combination of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
