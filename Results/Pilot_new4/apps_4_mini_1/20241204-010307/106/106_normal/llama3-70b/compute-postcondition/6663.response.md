Postcondition: ***`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Additionally, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` remain within the bounds of the grid, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
