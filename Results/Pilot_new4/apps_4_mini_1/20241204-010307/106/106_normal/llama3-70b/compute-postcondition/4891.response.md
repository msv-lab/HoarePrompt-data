The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables in the initial state do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables along with the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` now contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions along with `(ncur, 2)`; current direction is (1, 0); `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
