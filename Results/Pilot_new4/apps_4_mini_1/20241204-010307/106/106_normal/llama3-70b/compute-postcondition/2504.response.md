Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
