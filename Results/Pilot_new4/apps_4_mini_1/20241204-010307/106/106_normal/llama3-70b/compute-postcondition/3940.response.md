Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the minimum distances from the original position to all reachable positions based on piece types, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `cur` is the value of the last processed piece, and `piece` is the type of the last processed piece. If no valid moves were possible during any iteration, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for unreachable positions.**
