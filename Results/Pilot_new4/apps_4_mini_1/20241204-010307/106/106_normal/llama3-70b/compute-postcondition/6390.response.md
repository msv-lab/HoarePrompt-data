The line of code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a new tuple `(cur, i)` into the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, but `cur` is assumed to be a current position or index, while `i` represents a piece whose current value is not equal to `piece`. Since the `queue` is previously stated to be empty if the loop does not execute, it will now contain the new tuple `(cur, i)`.

Other variables such as `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged since the operation does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` now contains the tuple `(cur, i)`, where `cur` is the current position and `i` is the piece value not equal to `piece`.**
