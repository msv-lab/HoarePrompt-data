Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1` and is greater than the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, the queue now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
