The code assigns `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and also assigns `piece` to it. The variable `ncur` is derived from the array `A` based on `nx` and `ny`, which in turn are calculated using `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Given that `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to both `cur` and `piece`, the output state updates this variable accordingly. The initial conditions surrounding `N`, `y`, and the array values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
