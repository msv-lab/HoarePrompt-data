The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `dx` and `dy`. Given that `nx` was initially equal to `x + (-2)` and `ny` was equal to `y + (-1)`, the new values will be computed as follows:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `x + (-2)`, hence `nx` will change.
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `y + (-1)`, hence `ny` will change.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values of `nx` and `ny` are:

- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`
- `ny` is equal to `y - 1`

The output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, along with the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`; `y` is an integer between `0` and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1.**
