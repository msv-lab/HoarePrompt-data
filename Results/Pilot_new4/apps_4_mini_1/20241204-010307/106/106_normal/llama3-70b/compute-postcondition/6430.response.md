Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1 or 1, `ny` is 0 or 2, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated, `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes, `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, and `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples along with `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged.***
