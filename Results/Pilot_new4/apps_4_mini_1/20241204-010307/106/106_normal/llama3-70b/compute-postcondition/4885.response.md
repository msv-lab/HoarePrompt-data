Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, the state remains unchanged.***
