Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for some values based on reachable positions from `(x, y)` according to the logic of the code, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`. Values for `nx` and `ny` would have been attempted for all combinations of `dx` and `dy`, but only those within the bounds of `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` will have affected `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. If no positions were reachable, then `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
