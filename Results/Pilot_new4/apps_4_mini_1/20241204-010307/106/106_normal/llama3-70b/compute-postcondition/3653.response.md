The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. This means that `parent[2][ncur]` will now hold the current state represented by `cur` and `piece`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The only updated information is that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
