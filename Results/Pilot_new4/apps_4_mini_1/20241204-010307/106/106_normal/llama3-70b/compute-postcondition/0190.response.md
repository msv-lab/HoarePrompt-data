The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, the values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the specific value of `N`.

The output state will specify the assignments made, while maintaining the valid precondition values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
