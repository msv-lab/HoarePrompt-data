Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` equals 1, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and the tuple of `ncur` and 1 is appended to `queue`. If these conditions are not met, no changes occur in the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
