Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`, and `queue` is updated to include the new tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If `nx` and `ny` are out of bounds, then there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
