Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the position represented by `cur` to all valid `ncur` values, `parent[2][ncur]` records the corresponding `cur` and `piece` values for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` that were appended during the loop execution based on valid movements. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
