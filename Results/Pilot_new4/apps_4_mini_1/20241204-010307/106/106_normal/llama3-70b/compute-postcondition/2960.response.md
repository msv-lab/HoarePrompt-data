To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop operates based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`, which represent possible movements (up, down, left, right). Each iteration of the loop will evaluate a new position based on these movements.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 0
- `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions
- `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position
- `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations

We do not know the specific values of `cur` and `ncur` from the previous iteration, but we understand that the loop's condition relies on these values and the movements defined. 

The loop will execute again as long as there are more tuples in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]` to process. After processing one tuple, the loop will move to the next one.

1. The current iteration processes one of the movement tuples. After that, it would proceed to the next tuple in the next iteration.
2. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` may change, but since we only need to adjust the state for the next iteration, and we do not have specific values for `cur` and `ncur`, we will keep the existing states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` as they are.
3. The loop will repeat for each tuple in the list, meaning we will simply denote the next movement tuple being processed.

Since we are focusing on the state for the next iteration of the loop, we will consider that the current tuple being processed has been completed and will move to the next tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` still contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations. The next movement tuple to be processed is one of `[(1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.**
