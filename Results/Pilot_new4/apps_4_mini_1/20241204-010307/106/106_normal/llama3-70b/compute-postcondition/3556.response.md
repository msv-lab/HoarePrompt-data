The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not mentioned in the initial state, so we can't specify them, but they are assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
