The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are the current indices in the array `A`. The value of `A[nx][ny]` depends on the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `ncur` is now defined, while the other variables maintain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
