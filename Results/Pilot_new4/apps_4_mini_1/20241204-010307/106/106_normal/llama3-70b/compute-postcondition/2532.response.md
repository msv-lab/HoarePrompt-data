According to the code, the loop iterates over the directions represented by the tuples in the list `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`. The loop will execute one more time if there are still directions left to process. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have been set to the values corresponding to the last direction processed in the list.

Given that the loop starts with the first direction and processes each one in order, we can determine the current index of the direction. Since the loop is iterating over 4 directions, after 3 iterations, `dx` and `dy` would be updated to the values of the fourth direction, which are `(0, 1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it must process the next direction, but since there are no more directions left to process after the fourth one, it can't execute again.

Thus, to adjust the state, we need to set `dx` and `dy` to the next direction, if possible. However, since there are no more directions in the list after processing all 4, we recognize that for the loop to potentially execute again, we would need to either reinitialize the loop or handle the exit condition.

Thus, while we cannot adjust the current direction to a new one since it has exhausted the list, we can represent the state indicating that no further execution is possible.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0; `dist[2][ncur]` is unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` is unchanged; `queue` is unchanged; `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions.**
