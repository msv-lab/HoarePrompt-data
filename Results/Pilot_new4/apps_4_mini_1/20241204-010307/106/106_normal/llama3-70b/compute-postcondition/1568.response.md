The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The value of `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the pair `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[1][2]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**
