The code calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Here, `x` is initially 1, `y` is initially 0, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1. 

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx` which is `1 + (-2) = -1`
- `ny = y + dy` which is `0 + (-1) = -1`

The other variables (`N`, `queue`, `dist`, `parent`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1**
