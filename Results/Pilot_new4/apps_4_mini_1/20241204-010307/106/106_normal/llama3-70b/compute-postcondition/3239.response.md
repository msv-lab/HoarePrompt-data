Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `piece` is assigned, while `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no actions are taken.***
