The code modifies the `queue` to append a tuple composed of `ncur` and `1`. Since `ncur` has already been assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, this operation impacts the `queue` variable. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
