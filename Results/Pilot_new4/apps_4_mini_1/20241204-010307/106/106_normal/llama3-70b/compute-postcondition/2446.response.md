According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which represents the possible movements in a grid. There are 4 possible (dx, dy) pairs: `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and the loop must have just processed one of the tuples.

The possible pairs are processed in the order they are defined. If we have processed one pair, the loop will proceed to the next pair in the next iteration. Since `y` is 0, after processing the first pair `(-1, 0)`, the next pair `(1, 0)` will be processed next.

There are no conditions affecting the values of `N`, `cur`, or `piece` based on the loop itself; thus, we keep their values unchanged for the next iteration. The only variable that changes is the index of the tuple being processed.

Since `dx` and `dy` are being iterated over, the next iteration will be for `(1, 0)`, and the loop will continue to execute for the next tuple until all tuples have been processed.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `-1 + dy`; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is `(1, 0)`**
