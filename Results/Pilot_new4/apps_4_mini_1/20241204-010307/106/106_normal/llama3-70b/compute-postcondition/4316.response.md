The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but no changes are made to the other variables. The current values of the relevant variables remain unchanged, except for the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` has `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
