The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing `queue`. The previous states of the variables are unaffected by this operation, but the `queue` variable now includes the new tuple. 

Thus, the Output State remains as follows, with the updated value of `queue` including the new tuple:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)` along with its previous elements, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
