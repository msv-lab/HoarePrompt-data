The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged in this operation, but `parent[1][ncur]` is updated. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
