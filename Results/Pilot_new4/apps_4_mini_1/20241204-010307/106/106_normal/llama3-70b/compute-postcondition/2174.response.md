The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which is set to `(cur, piece)`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state given, but we know `piece` is equal to `2`. Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` will hold the tuple `(cur, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2)**.
