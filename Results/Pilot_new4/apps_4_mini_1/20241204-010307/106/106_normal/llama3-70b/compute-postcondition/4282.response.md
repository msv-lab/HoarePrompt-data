The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[2][ncur]`. The specific values depend on the previous state of `dist` and the values of `cur`, `ncur`, and potentially others affected.

1. `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which means it will take the value from the array `A` at indices `nx` and `ny`.
2. The value at `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`. This means we need to know the previous value at `dist[2][cur]` to determine the new value.

Given that:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 1
- `y` is `N - 1`
- `nx` is `1 + dx` (where `dx` is a prior state we do not have)
- `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy` (where `dy` is also a prior state we do not have)
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`

Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain its value. Therefore, we only know that `dist[2][ncur]` gets a new value based on whatever `cur` was pointing to, incremented by 1.

As a result, we can summarize:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
