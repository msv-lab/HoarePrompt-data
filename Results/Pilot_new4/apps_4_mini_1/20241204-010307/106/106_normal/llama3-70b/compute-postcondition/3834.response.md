The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The previous states of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `piece` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, the queue includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, the queue includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
