In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are calculated by updating their values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically:

1. `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`. Since `dx` is `-1`, this means `nx` will be `x - 1`.
2. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `dy` is `-1`, this means `ny` will be `y - 1`, which is `1 - 1 = 0`.

Now incorporating the calculations:

- The value of `nx` remains as `x - 1` (no specific value of `x` is provided).
- The value of `ny` is now `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0.**
