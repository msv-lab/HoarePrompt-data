Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2 if the conditions are met; `dist[2][ncur]` must be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if conditions are unmet; `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` may include the next position accordingly.

```
dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1
```

Now, please think step by step: The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`, setting it to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. This code changes the value at `dist[2][ncur]` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2 if the conditions are met; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` may include the next position accordingly.**
