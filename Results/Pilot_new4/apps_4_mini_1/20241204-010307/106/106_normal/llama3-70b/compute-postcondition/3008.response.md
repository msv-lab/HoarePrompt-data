Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If `piece` is 0, `dist` may have been updated for multiple positions based on the reachable `(nx, ny)` computed from the original `(x, y)` with the offsets `dx` and `dy`. The elements in `queue` represent all newly reachable positions that were processed, while `parent` holds the predecessors for those positions. If no updates occurred, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
