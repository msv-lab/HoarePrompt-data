The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, as the code only affects the `queue`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values with the addition of the new element in `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 2)` appended.**
