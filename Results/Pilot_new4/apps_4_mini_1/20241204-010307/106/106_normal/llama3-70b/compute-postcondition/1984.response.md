Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices. `piece` remains unchanged at 0. If any valid tuples `(nx, ny)` were found within bounds such that `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is the minimum distance updated accordingly, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last position from which that index was reached, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces. If no valid conditions were met, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their state before the loop.**
