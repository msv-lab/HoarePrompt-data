Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer that was incremented to `y + 1` and is less than `N`. After all iterations of the loop, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance to each valid `ncur` position from the starting position, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the parent position and piece that led to `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` for positions that were reachable according to the conditions met during the loop execution. If no iterations were executed, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
