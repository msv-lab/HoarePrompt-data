The code snippet executes the following action: it appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are directly used, and since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, it is important to note that `ncur` is a value derived from the grid.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but we have now updated the `queue` to include the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) and now includes `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
