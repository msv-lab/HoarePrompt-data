Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 1)` where the conditions `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` were met during the iterations, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the distances from `cur`, and `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`. `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, and `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` remain as initially set for all valid `ncur`. If no conditions were met during execution, `queue` would remain unchanged and contain only `(ncur, 0)` tuples.**
