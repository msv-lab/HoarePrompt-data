The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is assigned from `A[-1][-1]`, but we don't have the specific value of `cur` or the contents of `A`. However, the overall structure indicates `parent[0][ncur]` will take the pair of values `(cur, piece)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
