Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged. If `nx` is within the bounds of `[0, N)` and `ny` is within the bounds of `[0, N)`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
