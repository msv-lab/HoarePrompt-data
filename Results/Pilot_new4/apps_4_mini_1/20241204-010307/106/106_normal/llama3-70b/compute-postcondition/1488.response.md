The operation `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state; however, the current value of `piece` is indicated to be different from `i`, which suggests that `i` is a valid index for the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Since we don't have specific values for `cur` and `i`, we can only note that they are added to the `queue`. The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` are still valid and provide context for the operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dist[2]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell for piece 2; `parent[2]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell for piece 2; `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
