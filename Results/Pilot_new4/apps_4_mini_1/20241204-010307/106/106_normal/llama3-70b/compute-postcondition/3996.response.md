The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` remains unchanged, and thus we do not have to update any other variables except for `queue`. The other variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and any other state remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` remains unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
