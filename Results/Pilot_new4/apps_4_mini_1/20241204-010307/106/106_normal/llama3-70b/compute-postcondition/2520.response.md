The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which is a two-dimensional array, based on the variables `cur` and `piece`. The variable `piece` is equal to 2, so the assignment will set `parent[2][ncur]` to the value of `cur` along with 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, 2**.
