The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is 5 and `ny` is -1. However, we have no information about the array `A` or its dimensions and contents, so we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]**
