To determine the adjustments needed for the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the loop:

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which has 4 elements in total. 
2. For each iteration, `dx` and `dy` take on values from the tuples.
3. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list, meaning it will run a total of 4 times.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed the last element of the list, which corresponds to the last tuple `(1, 1)`. For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next tuple in the list, which does not exist in this case. Thus, no further iterations are possible. 

However, we need to maintain the state of the variables involved in the next potential iteration:

- Since the loop has already processed all tuples, there are no more `(dx, dy)` pairs left to process. 
- The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `cur`, and `parent` remain unchanged.

After considering all the previous points, it becomes clear that the next iteration cannot happen as we've exhausted our list of tuples. 

Therefore, the state will remain unchanged with the understanding that there are no more iterations possible.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and no further iterations are possible**
