The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before the execution of the code, this assignment will now change the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The earlier condition that `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` will no longer hold true after the assignment. 

The states of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
