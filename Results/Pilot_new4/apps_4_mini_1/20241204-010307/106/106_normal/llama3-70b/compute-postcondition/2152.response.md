The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the directional changes represented by `dx` and `dy`. The initial state does not specify the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, but it indicates that `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, and `piece` is equal to 1 while the current index in directions is 1, corresponding to the tuple `(-1, 1)`.

From the direction tuple `(-1, 1)`, we can infer that `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `1`. Therefore:

- `nx` is calculated as `x + (-1)`, which simplifies to `nx = x - 1`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + 1`, which simplifies to `ny = y + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignments of `nx` and `ny` while retaining the valid conditions of the pre-existing variables.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 1, index in directions is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
