The code appends a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous state of `queue` indicates that it contains at least one valid tuple, so the output state reflects the addition of the new tuple while maintaining the previous elements of `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent[2][ncur]` is now (cur, piece), `queue` contains at least one valid tuple and the newly added tuple (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, current values of `nx` and `ny` are within bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1.**
