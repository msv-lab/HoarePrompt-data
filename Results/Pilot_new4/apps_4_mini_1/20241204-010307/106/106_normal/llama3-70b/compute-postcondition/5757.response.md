Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` will contain tuples of (A[nx][ny], 0), (A[nx][ny], 1), and (ncur, 2); `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[2][ncur]` will be updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` will hold the corresponding values, while `parent[2][ncur]` will be equal to (cur, 2); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
