Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are updated based on the condition of `piece`. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur` and `piece` is either 1 or 2, if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest path distances from `cur` for `piece` 2, `parent[2]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices with `piece` 2, and `queue` includes `(cur, i)` as an additional element. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
