Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
