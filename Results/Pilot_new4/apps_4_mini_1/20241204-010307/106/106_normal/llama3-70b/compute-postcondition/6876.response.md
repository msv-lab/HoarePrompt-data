The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are -1 and 1, so `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y + 1`. The variables `N`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1**.
