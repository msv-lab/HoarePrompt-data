The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which is already defined in the initial state. Since `queue` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list at the start. The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`.

The variables that have changed or are affected are:
- `queue` is now updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Other variables retain their previous values as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
