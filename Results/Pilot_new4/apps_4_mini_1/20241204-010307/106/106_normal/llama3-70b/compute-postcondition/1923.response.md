Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains a tuple of `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
