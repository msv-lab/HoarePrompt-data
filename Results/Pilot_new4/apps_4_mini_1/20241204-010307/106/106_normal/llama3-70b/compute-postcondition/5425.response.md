Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, and `i` is a value not equal to 2. `dist[2]` is updated for each valid `(nx, ny)` such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `parent[2]` is updated accordingly, and `queue` contains all valid moves `(ncur, 2)` made from the original position. If no valid moves were available, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
