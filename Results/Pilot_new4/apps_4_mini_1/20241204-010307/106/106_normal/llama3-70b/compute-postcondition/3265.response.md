The statement `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, we need to check the previous values of `dx` and `dy`. They are part of a list, and the statement indicates that (dx, dy) must be reset to the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`.

Now we will calculate `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + (-1) = 0`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0.**
