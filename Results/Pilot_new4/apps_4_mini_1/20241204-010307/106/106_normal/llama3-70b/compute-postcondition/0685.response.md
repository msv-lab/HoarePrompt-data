The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. The variable `dx` is `0`, which means `nx` will be equal to `x`. The variable `dy` is `1`, so `ny` will be `y + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.**
