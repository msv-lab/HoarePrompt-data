In this case, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are confirmed to be `x - 1` and `y - 1`, respectively, and are constrained such that `0 ≤ nx, ny < N`. The value of `ncur` is dependent on the 2D list `A` at the specified indices.

Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, it implies that `nx` will always be at least 0 and less than `N - 2`. The statement about `dist[0][ncur]` being greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur` is not affected by the assignment to `ncur`.

The output state will indicate the new assignment for `ncur` while retaining the constraints on `N`, `x`, `nx`, and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `0 ≤ nx, ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
