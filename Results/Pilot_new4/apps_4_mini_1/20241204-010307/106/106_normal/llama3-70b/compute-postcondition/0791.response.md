Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `0 <= y < N`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable states based on the pieces and their moves. If executed completely, `dist` will be updated with the minimum distances from `cur` for all reachable positions for each piece type, `parent` will track the predecessors for each respective `ncur`, and `queue` will include all valid reachable states from the processing of all `y` values.**
