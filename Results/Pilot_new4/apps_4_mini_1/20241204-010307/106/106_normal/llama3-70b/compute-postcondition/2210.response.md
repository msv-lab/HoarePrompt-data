According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pairs `(dx, dy)` in the specified list. The loop will iterate over these pairs in sequence. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the first pair `(-2, -1)`, since `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the state after that processing. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it will proceed to the next pair in the list.

Currently, the loop is set to process the second pair `(-2, 1)`. Since there are a total of 8 pairs, once we reach the end of this list, the loop will no longer have pairs to process. Thus, after processing the second pair, the loop will need to continue on to the next pairs.

State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the updated parent at index `0` for `ncur`, which is now `cur`, `queue` contains two elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0)]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, piece is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, now processing the second pair `(-2, 1)`**
