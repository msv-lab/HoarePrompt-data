According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of directional movements represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute once for each of these tuples. Since the last state does not specify which tuple was used in the last iteration, we will assume that the loop was executing in order.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop must have executed for the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`, meaning we need to adjust for the next iteration. 

Since there are 4 tuples in total, if the current iteration has completed the last tuple `(0, 1)`, it indicates that the loop is ready to exit, and thus there are no more tuples left for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we need to indicate that the loop has completed all iterations, and there are no more tuples left to use.

State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves and `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, the queue now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the loop is ready to exit after processing all movements**.
