Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
