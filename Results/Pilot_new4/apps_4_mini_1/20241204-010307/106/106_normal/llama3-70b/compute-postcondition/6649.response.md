Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)` if at least one valid position exists; `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)` if at least one valid position exists; `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from `(1, 0)`; if no valid positions exist, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initialized values, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
