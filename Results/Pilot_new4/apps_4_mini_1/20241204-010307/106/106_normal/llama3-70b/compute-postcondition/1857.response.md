Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
