Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and the values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
