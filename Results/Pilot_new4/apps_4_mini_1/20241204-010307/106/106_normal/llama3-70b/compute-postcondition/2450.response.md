In the provided code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`. The state of `cur` has not changed, and `piece` remains equal to 2. The values of other variables, including `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist`, are not directly affected by this assignment. 

The relevant updates are:
- `parent[2][ncur]` now holds a tuple consisting of the current value of `cur` and the value of `piece`, which is 2.

Therefore, the output state will maintain all previous information while reflecting the new assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2)**.
