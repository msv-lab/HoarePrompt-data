According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the list [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], which contains four pairs of changes to the coordinates (dx, dy). The loop will execute for each of these pairs. 

At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is still 1, indicating we are still considering the same piece, and the loop has gone through one of the pairs. Given that there are 4 pairs in total, the for loop has executed once, and we need to execute it for the next pair.

Since `piece` remains 1, we are still interested in the next value of (dx, dy). The next pair in the list will be used for the next iteration. 

To summarize the states: `N` remains within the range 3 to 10, `piece` is still 1, and we will be moving to the next pair in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the next (dx, dy) will be taken from the list [(-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)] in the sequential order.**
