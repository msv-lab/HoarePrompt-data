Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid neighboring cells reachable from `(0, 1)` based on the conditions provided, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid parent node for those updates, `queue` contains tuples of valid reachable cells from `(0, 1)` where the updates occurred, and if no valid moves were found, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged for those cells.**
