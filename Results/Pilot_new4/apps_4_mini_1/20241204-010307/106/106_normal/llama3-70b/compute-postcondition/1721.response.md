Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
