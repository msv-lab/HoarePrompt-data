To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze the current state and how it interacts with the loop. The loop iterates over the list of tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], which means it will execute a fixed number of iterations (4 in total). 

Given that the loop is based on a fixed iterable, the important part to consider is that the loop will iterate through all the specified tuples, and we need to keep track of the current iteration based on which tuple we are at.

Since the provided state indicates that this is the end of the previous iteration but does not specify which tuple was processed, we can assume it is at the end of one complete iteration. To prepare for the next iteration, we can keep track of which tuple will be processed next.

1. The current iteration is at the end of the loop processing, so we've just completed one of the four tuples.
2. We will now move to the next tuple in the list.
3. The tuple list has four tuples, so after processing the last tuple (which is (1, 1)), the next state to process will loop back to the first tuple after all tuples have been processed.

Since there are 4 iterations, if the loop has been completed, we would adjust for the next iteration as follows:

- We can denote the current iteration based on the index of the tuple processed.
- If we denote the index of the last processed tuple as `index`, for the next iteration we would have `index` incremented by 1 modulo the length of the tuples.

Assuming we are at the last tuple (1, 1) after the 4th iteration, we will cycle back to the first tuple (-1, -1).

Thus, to execute one more time, we consider this scenario:

- The index will go from 3 (for (1, 1)) to 0 (for (-1, -1)).
- The states remain mostly unchanged, but we note which tuple we will be processing again.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged; `parent` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`; index for tuple is 0 for (-1, -1)**.
