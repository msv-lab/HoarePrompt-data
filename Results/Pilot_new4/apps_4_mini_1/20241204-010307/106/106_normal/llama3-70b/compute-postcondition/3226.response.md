The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` becomes `A[dx][dy]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, and the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`.**
