The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 1` and `-1`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value of the element located at row `x - 1` and column `-1` in the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `ny` is `-1`, this indicates that we are accessing the first column (or possibly an invalid index if `A` is not zero-indexed). However, we will assume that the array `A` is valid for the given indices.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`.**
