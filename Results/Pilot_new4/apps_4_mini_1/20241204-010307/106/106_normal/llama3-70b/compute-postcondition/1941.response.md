According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuple pairs `(dx, dy)` which represent the possible moves. The loop will execute once for each pair in the given list. At the end of the last iteration, all values related to `dist`, `parent`, and other variables remain unchanged unless specific conditions were met.

Since there are eight pairs in the list `[(−2,−1), (−2,1), (−1,−2), (−1,2), (1,−2), (1,2), (2,−1), (2,1)]`, if the loop has executed one time, it will proceed to execute again for the next pair.

As we are looking to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to update the variables we care about. Since the loop iterates over pairs, the next `(dx, dy)` pair will be taken from the list of tuples.

If we assume that the loop has executed zero times so far, the first pair would be `(-2, -1)`. If we assume it has executed once, it would be the second pair `(-2, 1)`, and so forth. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know the loop hasn't executed eight times because if it had, there would be no pairs left.

To update the states for the next iteration after one execution, the current pair to process `(dx, dy)` should be the second one `(-2, 1)`, as the first execution would have processed `(-2, -1)`.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + (-2)`, `ny` is equal to `4 + 1`, `ncur` is the next computed index, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
