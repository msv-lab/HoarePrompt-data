To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop iterating through the possible movements in a two-dimensional space.

1. The loop iterates over the pairs `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which represent movements in the up, down, left, and right directions respectively. 

2. For the loop to execute and make valid moves, we need to ensure:
   - The positions being moved to (calculated using `cur` and the values from `(dx, dy)`) must be valid within the dimensions of the array `A`.
   - `cur` must be defined and should represent a valid position in the two-dimensional array.
   - The values in `queue` should reflect all valid positions that can be reached from `cur` after applying the movements specified by `(dx, dy)`.

Given that the state mentions that `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 1)` added during prior iterations, but does not specify what `cur` is or whether it leads to valid movements, we will assume that the loop can only execute correctly under certain conditions.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to ensure that the loop can execute are as follows:

- `cur` must represent a valid position within the bounds of the two-dimensional array `A`.
- `queue` should not be empty to indicate that there are positions from which to make moves.
- The updated distances in `dist[1]` and parent states in `parent[1]` should reflect changes only if valid moves are possible.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, and `queue` must contain valid positions to allow the loop to execute**
