The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The specific values for `nx` and `ny` are derived from the previously defined variables `x` and `y` along with `dx` and `dy`, respectively. Since the values of `nx` and `ny` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. Other variables remain unchanged in the output state. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations with the tuples list reset to [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
