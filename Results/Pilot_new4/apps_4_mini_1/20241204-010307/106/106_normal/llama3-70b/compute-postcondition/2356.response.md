Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
