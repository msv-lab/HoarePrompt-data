The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The variable `dist` is being updated at the index `[0][ncur]`, which relies on the previous value of `dist[0][cur]`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

The initial conditions state that `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` plus 1. This condition confirms that the assignment to `dist[0][ncur]` will be valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
