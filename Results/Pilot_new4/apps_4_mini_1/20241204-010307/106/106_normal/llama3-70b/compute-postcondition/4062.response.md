The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are known to satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, which means they are valid indices for the array `A`. Therefore, `ncur` takes the value at the specified indices in the array `A`.

Since the values of other variables remain unchanged, the Output State will include the updated value of `ncur` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values, `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 0)` for valid transitions, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
