Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and, if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is satisfied, it will also include the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access; if `piece` is 1 and the distances condition holds, then `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 1)`.***
