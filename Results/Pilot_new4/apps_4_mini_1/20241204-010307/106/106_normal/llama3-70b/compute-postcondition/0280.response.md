The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. 

The previous values of the variables remain unchanged, and the new value for `queue` will include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and `N - 1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
