Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs plus the new pair `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
