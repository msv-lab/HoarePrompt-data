The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the `parent` matrix is being updated at the position `[1][ncur]` with the value of `cur` and `piece`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, it holds the value of an element from the array `A` at the specified indices. However, `cur` and `piece` values are not provided, so we cannot determine their specific values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y + 1]; parent[1][ncur] is updated to cur, piece.**
