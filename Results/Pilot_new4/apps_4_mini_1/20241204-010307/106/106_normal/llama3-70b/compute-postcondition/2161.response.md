In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the previous values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

Given that `x` and `y` represent current coordinates, and `dx` and `dy` represent some offsets, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be calculated as follows:
- `nx` would take the value of `x` increased by the value of `dx`.
- `ny` would take the value of `y` increased by the value of `dy`.

Since the initial state includes valid distances for reachable indices and parent tracking, we will retain that information while updating the variables `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each updated index during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
