According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `N`. The current value of `y` is 0 at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will continue as long as `y` is less than `N`. Given that `N` is between 4 and 10, for the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, 1)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `1`.**
