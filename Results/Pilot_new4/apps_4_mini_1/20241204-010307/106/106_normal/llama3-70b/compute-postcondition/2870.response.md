Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `piece` is updated to 2, `queue` contains an additional element `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` equals `A[nx][ny]`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made to the variables.***
