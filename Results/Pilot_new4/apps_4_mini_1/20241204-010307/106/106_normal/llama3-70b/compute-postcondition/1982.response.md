Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains unchanged; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]`, and `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
