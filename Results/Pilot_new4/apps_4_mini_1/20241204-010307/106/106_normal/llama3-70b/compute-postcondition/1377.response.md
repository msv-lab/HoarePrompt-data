The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the expressions `nx = 2 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` will be within bounds since it is calculated from a specific value (2) plus `dx`. Similarly, `ny` will also be within bounds since it is calculated from a specific value (0) plus `dy`. 

The state of the variables that have not changed remains valid. The values of `A`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states; `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
