The line of code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`. Specifically, it assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`, the exact value of `ncur` is not directly defined in the initial state but is dependent on the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, the variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so we will denote it as a variable in the output state. The variable `piece` is unchanged at 2.

The output state reflects that the value of `parent[2][ncur]` now includes `cur` and `piece`, while all other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that were updated during the loop, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, 2)`**.
