Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `ncur` and `1` are appended to `queue`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
