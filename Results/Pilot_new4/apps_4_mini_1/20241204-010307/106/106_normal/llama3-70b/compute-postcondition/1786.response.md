Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `piece` is 0; `x` is such that `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]` based on valid `nx` and `ny` such that 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.**
