Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the updated distances for all reachable valid positions from (1, 1), `parent[2]` contains predecessors for valid positions, and `queue` contains tuples of all valid positions that had their distances updated. If no valid positions were reachable, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
