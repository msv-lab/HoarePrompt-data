The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The preceding states of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The initial state includes the definition of `ncur`, which is `A[1 + dx][2 + dy]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is already defined as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Therefore, the state remains consistent, with only the `parent` variable being updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `cur` remains unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1 + dx][2 + dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
