To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to analyze how the loop operates and what modifications are necessary based on the provided state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The current iteration of the loop will modify the values of `nx` and `ny` based on these deltas. 

1. The loop iterates over 8 pairs of `(dx, dy)`.
2. For each iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will impact how `nx` and `ny` are calculated.
3. After the last iteration, the loop will need to prepare for the next tuple in the list.
4. At the end of the last iteration, we can assume that we have completed an iteration with one pair of `(dx, dy)` and will now move to the next one.

Since the loop consists of the deltas mentioned and we need to account for which pair of `(dx, dy)` corresponds to each iteration, we should expect that after processing the last pair `(2, 1)`, we will not have any more pairs to iterate over.

Based on the state provided:

- If there were changes made to any states during the current iteration, they would still hold true as they would not revert unless specified.
- The loop will iterate over all pairs, so if the last pair processed was the last one, the index for the tuples would move beyond the available pairs.

To summarize the adjustment needed:

- Since there are no changes to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` that affect the loop iteration itself, we simply need to prepare for the next `(dx, dy)` pair which would be out of range.

Assuming that the last pair processed was `(2, 1)`, the next iteration would be out of the list bounds. Given that we are moving to a state where the next iteration will not occur, we can specify:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the next `(dx, dy)` will not be available.**
