Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx` for each `dx` in `[-2, -2, -1, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2]` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy` for each `dy` in `[-1, 1, -2, 2, -2, 2, -1, 1]`; for each valid `(nx, ny)` pair, `ncur` is assigned the corresponding value from `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`; if none of the conditions are met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
