The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the element `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not given, but it can be noted that `parent[1][ncur]` will now hold that tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
