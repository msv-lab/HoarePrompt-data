Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + 1]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended; otherwise, no changes are made.***
