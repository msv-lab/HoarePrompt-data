The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `queue`, which is assumed to exist in the initial state, and other variables remain unchanged. Since `queue` is being modified, we need to reflect that change in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -2, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
