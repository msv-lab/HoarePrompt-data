The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the movement offsets `dx` and `dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` now reflect the coordinates after the move. Since `dx` and `dy` are both 1, `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` becomes `y + 1`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` where `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and the next `(dx, dy)` pair being processed is `(1, 1)`**.
