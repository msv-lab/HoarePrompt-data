The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added to the `queue`, which means that only the state of `queue` is affected. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][N]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
