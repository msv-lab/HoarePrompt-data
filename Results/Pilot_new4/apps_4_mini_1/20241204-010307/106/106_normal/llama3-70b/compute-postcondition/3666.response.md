`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will remain equal to `y`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but now we explicitly know that `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. 

Since `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `nx` will be valid as it will be between `-1` and `N-2`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`.**
