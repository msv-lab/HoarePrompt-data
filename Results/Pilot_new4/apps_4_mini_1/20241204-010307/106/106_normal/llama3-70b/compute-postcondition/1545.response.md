Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. If the loop did not execute, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
