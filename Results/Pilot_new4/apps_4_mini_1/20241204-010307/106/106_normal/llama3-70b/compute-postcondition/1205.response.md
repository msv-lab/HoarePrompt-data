The statement assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` will now be stored in the `parent` array at the specified indices. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, with `ncur` still equal to `A[nx][ny]` based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur] is assigned (cur, piece)**
