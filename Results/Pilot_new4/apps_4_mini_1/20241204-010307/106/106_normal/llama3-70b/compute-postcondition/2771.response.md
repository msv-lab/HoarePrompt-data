The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the list `queue`. No other variables are affected directly by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is the current y-coordinate
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`
- `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`

The only change in this state is the addition of the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
