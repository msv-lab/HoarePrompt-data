The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`, but the specific value of `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `parent[2][ncur]` while maintaining the rest of the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
