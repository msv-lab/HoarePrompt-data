The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The other variables are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged. The output must reflect that `queue` now contains an additional element which is the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
