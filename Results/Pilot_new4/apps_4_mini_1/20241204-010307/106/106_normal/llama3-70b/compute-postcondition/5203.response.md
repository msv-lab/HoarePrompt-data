After executing the code snippet, the impact on the program is that the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the `queue` now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
