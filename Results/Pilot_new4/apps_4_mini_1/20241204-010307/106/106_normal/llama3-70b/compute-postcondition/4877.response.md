The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny`. Specifically, `nx` will take on the value of `x` plus one of the values in `dx`, and `ny` will take on the value of `y` plus one of the values in `dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` contain the possible direction changes, which include movements in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, the values of `nx` and `ny` can be represented as expressions. After this code executes, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values chosen from `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for any value in `dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for any value in `dy`.**
