The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial conditions state that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which implies that `dist[1][cur]` is now effectively closer by one unit to the point at `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we maintain the information regarding the relationships between `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `piece` is 1.**
