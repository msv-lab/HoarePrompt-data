The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables are affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state remains the same for all other variables, and we include the new state of `queue` with the appended tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` has `(ncur, 1)` appended.**
