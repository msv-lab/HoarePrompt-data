The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 2` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and the impact of `nx` and `ny` on `ncur` is defined through the assignment from the 2D array `A`. The states of the variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not affected, only `ncur` is updated.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `(ncur, 0)` in addition to the original element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
