The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N-1, and `N` is between 3 and 10, ensuring that the indices used to access array `A` are valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged; therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]**.
