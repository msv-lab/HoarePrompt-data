Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is in a state that allows updates based on valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects potential connections, `queue` now contains the previous elements along with the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` representing the current value of `ncur` and the piece value of `1`.**
