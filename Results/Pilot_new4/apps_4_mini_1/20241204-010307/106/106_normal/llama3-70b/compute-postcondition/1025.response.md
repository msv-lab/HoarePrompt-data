The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the previous values of `x` and `y`, along with the values of `dx` and `dy` (which are not specified in the initial state). Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The values of `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, thus:

- `nx` = `0 + dx`
- `ny` = `2 + dy`

The states of the other variables remain unaffected since no additional operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains corresponding `cur` values for updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` appended during loop execution.**
