The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the distance at index `ncur` based on the distance at index `cur`, incrementing it by 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. The values of `dist[0][ncur]` and `dist[0][cur]` will influence the output state, but we do not have the exact values for them. However, we can establish the relationship.

Before executing the line of code:
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`.
- The current tuple for the next iteration will be `(-2, 1)`, and the state of `parent`, `piece`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`; `piece` is set to 0; `queue` includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; for the next iteration the current tuple will be (-2, 1).**
