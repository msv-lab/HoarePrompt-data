Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is an integer between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no modifications are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
