Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position to each reachable position represented in `A`, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions used to reach each position, and `queue` contains all reachable positions that were updated during the execution of the loop based on valid moves from `(x, y)`. If no moves were valid, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
