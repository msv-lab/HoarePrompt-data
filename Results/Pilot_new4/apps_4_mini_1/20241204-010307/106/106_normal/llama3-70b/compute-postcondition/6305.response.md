According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. The loop will execute `N` times, starting from `x = 0` and ending at `x = N-1`. Since `N` is stated to be between 3 and 10, it is assured that the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `x` must be initialized to the starting value of 0, as that is the default starting point for a range loop in Python. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the necessary states are:
- `N` should be between 3 and 10 (which it already is),
- `x` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0**
