Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position to each reachable position; `parent[1]` contains the parent positions used to reach each position; `queue` contains all reachable positions that were updated during the execution of the loop, plus the position `(cur, i)` appended to it; if `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances to the positions reachable from the starting position, and `parent[2]` contains the parent positions used to reach those positions; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
