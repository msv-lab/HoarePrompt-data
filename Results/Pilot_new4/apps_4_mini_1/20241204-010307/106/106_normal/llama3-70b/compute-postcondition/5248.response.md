Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
