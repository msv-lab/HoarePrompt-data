According to the code, the loop is iterating over a list of tuples that represent changes in the values of `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the previous iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1.

The next iteration of the loop will take the next tuple from the list. The tuples are:
1. (-2, -1)
2. (-2, 1)
3. (-1, -2)
4. (-1, 2)
5. (1, -2)
6. (1, 2)
7. (2, -1)
8. (2, 1)

Since the last values of `dx` and `dy` are `-2` and `-1` respectively, the next tuple to be processed will be `(-2, 1)`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` will be updated to `-2` and `dy` will be updated to `1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`.**
