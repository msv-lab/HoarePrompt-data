Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` if the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true; otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not met, there are no changes made to `queue`, `dist`, or `parent`.***
