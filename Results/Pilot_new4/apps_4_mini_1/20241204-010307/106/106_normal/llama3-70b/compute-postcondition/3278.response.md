The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. According to the preconditions, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which implies that `dist[1][cur]` was some value that is now less than `dist[1][ncur]`. After the execution of the code, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]` in relation to `dist[1][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; `queue` contains potential positions to explore; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
