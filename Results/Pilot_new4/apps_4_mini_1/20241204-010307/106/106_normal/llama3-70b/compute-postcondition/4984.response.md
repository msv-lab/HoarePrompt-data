In the provided code, the value of `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state but are assumed to be determined by the program's context. 

The states of the other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`) remain unchanged since the code only affects the `parent` array.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
