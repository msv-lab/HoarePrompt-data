The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Here, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, where `x` is currently `2` and `y` is `0`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, but it is given that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied after the operation.

Let's denote:

- `nx` becomes `2 + dx`
- `ny` becomes `0 + dy`

Since we know that `nx` and `ny` must remain within the bounds of `N`, we will focus on updating these values based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

After the code execution, the new values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy`, but we do not have those specific values. However, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, ensuring that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied for the next iteration.**
