The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both of which are within the bounds of the matrix, `ncur` will hold the value at these coordinates in the matrix `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is determined by the loop, `queue` contains valid tuples, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the matrix (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
