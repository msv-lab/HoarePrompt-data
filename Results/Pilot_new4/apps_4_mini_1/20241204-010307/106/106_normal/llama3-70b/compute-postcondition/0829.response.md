Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` are updated for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
