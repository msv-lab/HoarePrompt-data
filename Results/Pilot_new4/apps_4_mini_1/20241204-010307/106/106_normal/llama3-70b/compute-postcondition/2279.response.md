The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, combined with the pairs of differences given by `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and `y` retains its value of `N`. The variables `nx` and `ny` will take on various values as the pairs iterate through the provided differences.

Since `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the addition of `x` and `y` with `dx` and `dy`, we can say that:

- `nx` will be equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`.

Thus, for each pair of `(dx, dy)`, `nx` and `ny` will represent a new position derived from the original `(x, y)`.

The output state reflects that `nx` and `ny` will take on values derived from the current `x` and `y` values and the specific pairs of differences. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)**
