Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples in each iteration, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`).***
