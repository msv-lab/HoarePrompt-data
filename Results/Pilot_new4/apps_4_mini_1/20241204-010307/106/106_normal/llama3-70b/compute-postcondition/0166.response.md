The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The existing values of `ncur` and `cur` are still valid after this line executes, but the value of `parent[2][ncur]` is updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
