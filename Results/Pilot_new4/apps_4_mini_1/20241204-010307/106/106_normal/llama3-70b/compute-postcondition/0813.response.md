The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer 0 to the `queue` list. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
