The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The output state reflects that this assignment has taken place. The other variables retain their previous values, so we maintain their original descriptions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
