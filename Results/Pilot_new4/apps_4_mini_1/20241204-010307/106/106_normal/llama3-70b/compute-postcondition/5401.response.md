The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `4 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but since both `nx` and `ny` are specified as being within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), we know that `A[nx][ny]` will access a valid position within the matrix `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains updated distances, `parent[1]` contains path information, `queue` includes valid moves from `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains updated distances, `parent[1]` contains path information, `queue` includes valid moves from `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
