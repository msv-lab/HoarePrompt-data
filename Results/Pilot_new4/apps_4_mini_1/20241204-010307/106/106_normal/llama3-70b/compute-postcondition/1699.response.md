Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
