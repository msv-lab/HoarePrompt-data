The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Given the initial state, we have:

- `x` is 1
- `y` is `N - 1`
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
- `ny = (N - 1) + (-1) = N - 2`

The other variables (`N`, `cur`, and `A[x][y]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N-2`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
