The code assigns `nx` and `ny` the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, but they are assumed to reflect some change in position based on the previous direction tuple. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
