The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The state of `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remains unchanged, but the `queue` now contains an additional entry. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is the value of `piece`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
