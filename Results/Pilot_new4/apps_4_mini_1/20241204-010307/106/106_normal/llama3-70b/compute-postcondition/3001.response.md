`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, where `dx` is -2. Thus, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, where `dy` is 1. Therefore, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, which is 2, since `y` is initially 1. The values of `N`, `dist`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2.**
