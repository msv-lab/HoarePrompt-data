The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `ncur` will be based on the indices derived from `nx` and `ny`. The `piece` remains unchanged at 1, and the other variables (`dist`, `dist[1][cur]`, `parent`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
