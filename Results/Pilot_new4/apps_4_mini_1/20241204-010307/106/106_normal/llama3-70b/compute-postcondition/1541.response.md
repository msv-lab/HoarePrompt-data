The code updates the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]` to reference the variables `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are assumed to be valid in this context. Since no other variables are modified, the output state reflects the specific update made to the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is `A[1][3]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
