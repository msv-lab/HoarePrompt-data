In the given code, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. To determine the output state, we first note that `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]`, which indicates that it has a specific value based on the last element of a two-dimensional array `A`. 

Since we don't have the actual value of `cur` or the contents of `dist`, we cannot specify the values beyond what we know regarding `ncur`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state will retain the original conditions of these variables, while updating the `dist` array based on the operation performed. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]; dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1.**
