The code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the array `parent` at the index `[1][ncur]` to hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `ncur` and `piece` depend on the previously defined states. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, the exact value is not specified but is dependent on the values of `x` and `y`. The variable `cur` is also not defined in the initial state provided, so it remains unspecified.

Thus, the output state correctly reflects the change made to `parent`, while retaining the original state of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
