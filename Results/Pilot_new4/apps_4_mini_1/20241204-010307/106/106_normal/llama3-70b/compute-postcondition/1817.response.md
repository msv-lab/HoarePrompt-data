The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are inserted into the `queue`, but no other variables are modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated status of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[2][cur]` is less than the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
