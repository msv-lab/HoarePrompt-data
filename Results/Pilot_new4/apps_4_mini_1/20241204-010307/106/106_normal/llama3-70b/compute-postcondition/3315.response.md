The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and the state of `queue` before appending are not changed by this operation, but the `queue` now includes the new tuple.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` remains an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is `0 + dx`
- `ny` is `1 + dy`
- `dist[1]` remains unchanged
- `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `parent[1]` remains unchanged
- `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
