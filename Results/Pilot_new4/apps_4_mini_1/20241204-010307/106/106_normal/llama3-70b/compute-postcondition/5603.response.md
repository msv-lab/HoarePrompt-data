Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur` that was reachable from `cur` with `piece` equal to 2; `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur` reached; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples generated during the loop iterations; the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop executed, then the final states depend on the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` based on the values of `dist[2][cur]` and valid neighbors defined by `A[nx][ny]`.***
