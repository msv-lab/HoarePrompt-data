`dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variables `cur` and `ncur` are involved in this computation, but `cur` is not defined in the initial state. However, `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][0]`, which means we can refer to it directly.

The value of `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]` (which is unknown) plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify an exact state for `dist[1][cur]` but can denote it as `dist[1][cur]` in the output. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
