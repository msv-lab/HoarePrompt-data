The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined in terms of `dx` and `dy`, but we do not have the specific values of `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, `nx` will always be `1 + dx` and `ny` will always be `2 + dy`. The state of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remains the same since they are not modified by the assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
