In the given code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but we do not know its exact value based on the given states of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` will store a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`, which is a specific value of `2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [-1, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2], `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`**.
