Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, and `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no actions are taken.***
