Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for each `dx` in the set of horizontal changes; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy` for each `dy` in the set of vertical changes. The loop has executed 8 times, corresponding to the 8 pairs of (`dx`, `dy`). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` for any pair, then `ncur` can be equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for any valid `ncur`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuples of valid `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions for any `dx` and `dy` are not satisfied, no operations are performed.**
