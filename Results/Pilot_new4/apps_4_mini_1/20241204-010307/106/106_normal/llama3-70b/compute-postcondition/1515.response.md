The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `0` are added to the list `queue`, but no other variables are affected. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[0][1]`, it will retain its value as defined in the initial state. The `queue` variable will now include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `(dx, dy)` is (-2, -1), `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
