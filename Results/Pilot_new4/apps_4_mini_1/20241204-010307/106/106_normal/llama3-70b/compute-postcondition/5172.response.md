The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to N-1, we can conclude that `ncur` will hold the value from the matrix `A` at the specified indices.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
