The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x` and `y`, with `nx` being equal to `x + dx` and `ny` equal to `2 + dy`. Since both `nx` and `ny` are guaranteed to be within the range of `0` to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), we can infer that `A[nx][ny]` will yield a valid value from the 2D array `A`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
