Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` remains unchanged, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points based on the valid moves processed during the loop, `parent` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point updated during the loop execution, and `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points processed throughout the loop including the original states and any added tuples. If `A[x][y]` never equals `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` retain their initial states.**
