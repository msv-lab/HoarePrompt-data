The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. This operation does not change any of the previously defined variables, such as `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, or `parent`. The only change is the addition of the tuple to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (which is less than its previous value), `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`.**
