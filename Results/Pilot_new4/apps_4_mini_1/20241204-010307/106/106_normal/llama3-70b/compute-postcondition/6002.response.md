The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial state: `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is 8. The variable `N` is still greater than or equal to 9, while `y` remains 9, `dx` is -1, and `dy` is -1. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][8]`.**
