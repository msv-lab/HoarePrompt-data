Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to `1`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, there is no change to these variables. If the condition is not met, then there are no changes made to any of the variables.***
