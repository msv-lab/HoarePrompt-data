Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` and `dy` take on all values from the list [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `nx` and `ny` are the resulting coordinates after applying all transformations; `ncur` may have been updated for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs; `dist[0]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values; `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values; `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 0)` for valid transitions; if any of the conditions for updating were not met, the original values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
