The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the addition to the `queue` while keeping the other variables' descriptions intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `queue` has a tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended**.
