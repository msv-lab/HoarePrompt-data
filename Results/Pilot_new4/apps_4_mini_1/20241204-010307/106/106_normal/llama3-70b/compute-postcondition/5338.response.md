Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `dist[2][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains path information, and `queue` contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for valid moves where `piece` is 2. If no valid moves were available, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
