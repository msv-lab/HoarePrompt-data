Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 0, the distance to reach `ncur` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur` with the value of `piece`.**
