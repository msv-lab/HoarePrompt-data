The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means that `dist[0][cur]` must have a specific value that when incremented by 1 will be less than the original value of `dist[0][ncur]`. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` becomes equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the specific previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` is now changed to this new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions but now `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.
