Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
