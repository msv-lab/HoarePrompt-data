The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Given that `ncur` is defined previously as `A[nx][ny]`, we can state that `ncur` is now a specific value based on the values of `nx` and `ny`. Since the initial conditions define `N`, `piece`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` but do not specify the actual values of `A[nx][ny]` or the existing contents of `queue`, we can summarize the output state accordingly.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 1; `cur` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values; `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur] = (1, 1)`**.
