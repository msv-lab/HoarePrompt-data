The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, we can deduce that `ncur` will correspond to the value at the position `(x - 1, y - 1)` in the array `A`. The previous states of other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `ncur` along with all other valid preconditions. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, -1)` for the next iteration.**
