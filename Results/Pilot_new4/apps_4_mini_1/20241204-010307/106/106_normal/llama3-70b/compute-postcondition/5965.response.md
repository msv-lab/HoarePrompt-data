According to the code, the loop iterates through a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 9 and `dy` is the second element of the last tuple that was processed. The `dx` and `dy` values depend on the current iteration of the loop.

Since the current iteration is the last one for the provided list of tuples, after this iteration, the loop will move to the next tuple. The next tuple will be `(2, 1)`, which means `dx` will be updated to `2` and `dy` will be updated to `1`.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `10 + 1`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and the distance from the start to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1, the distance from the start to `ncur` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the parent of `ncur` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`**.
