Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive) and `ny` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive). The value of `piece` is 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
