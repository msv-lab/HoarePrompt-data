According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements. The loop will execute regardless of the state of `N`, `y`, or `x`, as these variables do not impact the execution of the loop itself. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take on the values from the list provided in each iteration.

However, to provide context for the execution of the loop, the states that are relevant are:

1. The variable `dist[1][ncur]` must be initialized correctly with valid values so that the loop can potentially affect them during its execution.
2. The `parent[1][ncur]` should also be initialized properly, though it may not change until the loop body runs.
3. The `queue` should ideally contain reachable positions that will be considered during the loop execution.

Since the state mentions that `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged if no updates were made, it is essential that the loop is able to execute without empty conditions in `queue`.

For the loop to execute correctly and potentially achieve meaningful results, we can summarize the necessary states as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is initialized for reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` is initialized for those positions, `queue` contains reachable positions `(ncur, 1)` where `piece` equals 1**
