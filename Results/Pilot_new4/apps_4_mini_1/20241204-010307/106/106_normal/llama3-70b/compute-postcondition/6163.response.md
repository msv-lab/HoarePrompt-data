In the given code snippet, the assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the variable `parent[1][ncur]` is being assigned a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. 

We know from the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (but it's not directly affected),
- `y` is 1,
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`,
- `ny` is 0,
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`,
- `piece` is equal to 1,
- `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` (but this doesn't affect the variables being assigned).

The state of the `parent` array is being updated at index `1` and `ncur` based on the values of `cur` and `piece`. The value of `cur` is not defined in the initial state provided, but it can be any valid value.

Therefore, the only change results from the assignment affecting `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
