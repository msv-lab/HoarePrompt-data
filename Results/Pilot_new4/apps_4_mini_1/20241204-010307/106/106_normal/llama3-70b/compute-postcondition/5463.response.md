The code assigns values to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The variable `cur` is used as an index, and `piece` is equal to `1`. The previous states of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged, as the code only modifies the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `(nx, ny)` are valid indices, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
