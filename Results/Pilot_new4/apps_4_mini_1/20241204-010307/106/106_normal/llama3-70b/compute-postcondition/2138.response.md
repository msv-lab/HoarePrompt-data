The operation `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. Initially, it was stated that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which means we can infer that after this operation, the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `dist[1][cur] + 1`. This means `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

The output state reflects the updates made to `dist[1][ncur]`, while preserving the context around other variables.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is currently 1, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where nx and ny are within bounds, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than this new value.**
