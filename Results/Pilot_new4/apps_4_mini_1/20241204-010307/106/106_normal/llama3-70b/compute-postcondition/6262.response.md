The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the provided expressions. `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, this means that `ny` will be `y - 1` (which equals 1), while `nx` will be `x - 1`. The value of `N` remains unchanged and is still between 3 and 10. The states of other variables that are unchanged remain as is. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1.**
