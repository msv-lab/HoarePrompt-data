The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the previous calculations and valid conditions provided in the initial state. Since `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, the values of `nx` and `ny` are guaranteed to be within the bounds of the array `A` (as ensured by the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, and `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0.**
