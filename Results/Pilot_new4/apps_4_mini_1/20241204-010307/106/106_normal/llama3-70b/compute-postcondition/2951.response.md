The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` represent some reachable position, while `dx` and `dy` are the changes in position. Since the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided, we can only indicate their updates in terms of their expressions. The states of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` must contain at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
