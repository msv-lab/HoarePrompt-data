Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (cur, 1), the current value of `piece` is not equal to 1, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.***
