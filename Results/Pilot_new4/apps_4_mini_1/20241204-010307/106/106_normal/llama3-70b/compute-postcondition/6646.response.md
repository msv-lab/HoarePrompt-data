The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not affected by this operation; only the `queue` variable is modified. 

Since `ncur` is based on the computations prior to this code snippet, it is important to mention that `ncur` retains its previously computed value. 

The output state remains consistent with the initial state, only reflecting that an item has now been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
