Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` that were added during the loop iterations based on the conditions being satisfied for each of the four possible movements (up, down, left, right) from the starting position `(1, N - 1)`. If `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` may have been updated for multiple `ncur` values based on the original values of `dist[2][cur]` and the corresponding `ncur` positions, reflecting the minimum distances calculated during the iterations. If the conditions for valid indices and updates were never met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` would remain unchanged from their initial states.**
