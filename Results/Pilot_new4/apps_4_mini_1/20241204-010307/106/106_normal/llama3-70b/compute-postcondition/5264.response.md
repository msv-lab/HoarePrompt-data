The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value `cur` (which is equal to `A[x][0]` and `A[4][0]`) to `parent[0][ncur]` and also assigns `piece` (which is equal to 0) to the same location. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly specified, but we know that `parent[0][ncur]` will be updated with the value `cur`.

Since `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, it will be determined based on `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that `piece` is assigned the value 0, which is already defined in the initial state. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
