In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The initial state provides the values for `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, but `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `x + 2` and `ny` will be equal to `2 + 1`, which calculates to `ny = 3`. 

As `N` is within the range of integers from 3 to 10, it does not affect the calculations of `nx` and `ny` directly and remains unchanged.

The output state will then reflect the updated values of `ny` while keeping `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`.**
