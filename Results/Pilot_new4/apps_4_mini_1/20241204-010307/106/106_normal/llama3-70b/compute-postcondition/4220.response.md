In the provided code snippet, the operation `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. Here are the steps to determine the output state:

1. The variable `cur` is the value held by `A[x][y]`, which depends on the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is 1 and `y` is calculated as `N - 1`, `cur` is `A[1][N - 1]`.
2. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`.
3. The expression `dist[0][cur] + 1` means that the value currently in `dist[0][cur]` will be incremented by 1 and assigned to `dist[0][ncur]`. 
4. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A`, and `dist` remain unchanged except for `dist[0][ncur]`.

Since the specific values of `A`, `dist`, and their elements are not given, we denote the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
