In the code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are known: `x` is 1 and `y` is 2. The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. 

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values for `nx` and `ny` based on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `queue` is updated during the loop execution**.
