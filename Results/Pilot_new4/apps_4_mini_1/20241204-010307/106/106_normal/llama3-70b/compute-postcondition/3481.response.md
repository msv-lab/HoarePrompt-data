The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`, effectively setting the parent of the current position in the `parent` array for the `piece` at the `ncur` index. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state incorporates the updated information about `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for valid positions, `parent[0]` is set accordingly, `queue` contains valid tuples from previous executions, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0` to `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` equals `2`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`.**
