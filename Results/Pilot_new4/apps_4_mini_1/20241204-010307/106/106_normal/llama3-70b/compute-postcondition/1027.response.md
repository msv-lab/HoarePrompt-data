The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both between 0 and N-1, and since `N` is between 3 and 10, this means that `nx` and `ny` can take values in the range 0 to 9. The value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values contained in the list `A` at the indexes `[nx][ny]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
