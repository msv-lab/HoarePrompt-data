Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
