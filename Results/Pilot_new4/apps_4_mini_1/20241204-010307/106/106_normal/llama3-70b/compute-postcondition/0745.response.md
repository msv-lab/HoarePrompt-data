The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial state, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `4`. Since `x` is an integer in the range `0 <= x < N`, `nx` will be in the range `1 <= nx <= 10` (as `N` can be at most `10`).

Given that `ny` is `4`, `ncur` will be determined by the specific values present in the array `A` at index `[nx][4]`. However, since we do not have the specific values of the array `A`, we can only express `ncur` in terms of `A` and the computed indices.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][4]`.**
