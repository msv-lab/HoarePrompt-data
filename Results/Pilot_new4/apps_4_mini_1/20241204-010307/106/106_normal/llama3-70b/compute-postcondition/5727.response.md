The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]` to a tuple consisting of the values `cur` and `piece`. Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which is valid as `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to `N`, the value of `parent[1][ncur]` is now set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` is updated such that `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated such that `parent[1][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, `piece` is defined before the loop, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`.**
