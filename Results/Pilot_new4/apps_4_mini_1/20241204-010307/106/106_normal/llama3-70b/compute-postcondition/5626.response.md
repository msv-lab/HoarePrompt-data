According to the code, the loop iterates over pairs of offsets `(dx, dy)` which represent the possible movements of a piece on a board. In this case, since each iteration of the loop processes a pair of offsets, it will execute for each pair in the provided list.

At the end of the last iteration, the `dx` and `dy` variables would have taken on the values of the last pair of offsets processed. The pairs in the list are:
1. (-2, -1)
2. (-2, 1)
3. (-1, -2)
4. (-1, 2)
5. (1, -2)
6. (1, 2)
7. (2, -1)
8. (2, 1)

Since the last iteration would have processed the last pair of offsets `(2, 1)`, the next iteration will be out of bounds for this list, as there are no more pairs to process. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need the index of the list that contains the pairs to be incremented, which means that there are no further pairs beyond what has already been processed. Therefore, the loop cannot continue.

As such, the state remains unchanged because the loop has processed all the pairs. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then the `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
