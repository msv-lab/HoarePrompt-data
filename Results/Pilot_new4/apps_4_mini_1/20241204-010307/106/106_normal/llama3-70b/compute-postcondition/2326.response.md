In the given code snippet, `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is dependent on the previous state, specifically calculated as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y - 1`. 

We know from the initial state:
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is -1
- `nx` is `x + 1`
- `ny` is `y - 1`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.

The variable `dist[1][ncur]` updates the distance at the specific index `ncur` to be one more than the current distance at index `cur`. 

Assuming that `cur` was previously defined but its value is not specified here, we can express the change as follows: 

1. The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Since the values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` have not changed in this operation, and the only change occurs within the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]`, we focus on that.

Therefore, the Output State remains:
Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
