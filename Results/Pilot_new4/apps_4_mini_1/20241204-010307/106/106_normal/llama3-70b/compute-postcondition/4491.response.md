The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are determined by the initial state. The `queue` variable is modified to include the new tuple, but no other variables are affected by this operation.

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-2]`, the value of `queue` will be updated to include this new value. 

The previous data about the variables remains the same, so we keep all the initial states for the variables that are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
