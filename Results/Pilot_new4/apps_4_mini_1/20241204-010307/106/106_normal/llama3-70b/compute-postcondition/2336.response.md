Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` contains at least 1 reachable position, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
