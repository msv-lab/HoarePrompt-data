According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `N` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` will become 2. Since `N` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. 

States related to `dist` and `parent` do not change unless valid moves are made; however, we do not have information about the state of `dist` and `parent` apart from their initial unchanged state for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, and `parent[1]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves.**
