The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The previous state mentions that `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]` and `cur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. Thus, `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur` (which is `A[0][0]`) and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
