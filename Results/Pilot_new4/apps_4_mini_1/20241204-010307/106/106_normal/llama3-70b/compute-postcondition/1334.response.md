The code assigns a new value to `parent[0][ncur]` which is now equal to `(cur, piece)`. However, we only know that `parent[0][ncur]` is updated, and we do not have specific values for `cur` and `piece` in the initial state. Therefore, the other variable states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples and includes `(ncur, 0)`, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
