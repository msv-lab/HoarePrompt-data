Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` contains updated distance values depending on valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the connections made for valid moves, and `queue` contains tuples of newly added nodes based on the conditions met during the loop's execution. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
