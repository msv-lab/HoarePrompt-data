To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we can analyze the changes to the variables involved:

1. The variables `dx` and `dy` are given as `-2` and `-1`, respectively.
2. The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`.

Since `y` is initially `0`, we can express `ny` as:
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + (-1) = -1`.

For `nx`, we need to consider that `x` has not been initialized in the initial state. However, since we're analyzing the code, we can express `nx` in terms of `x`:
- `nx = x + dx = x + (-2) = x - 2`.

As a result, the state of the variables after the execution of the code will be:
- `nx` becomes `x - 2`
- `ny` becomes `-1`

The other variables (`N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `dx`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1.**
