The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` sets the value of `parent[1][ncur]` to a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation. The state indicates that `parent[1][ncur]` is now the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now the tuple `(cur, piece)`.**
