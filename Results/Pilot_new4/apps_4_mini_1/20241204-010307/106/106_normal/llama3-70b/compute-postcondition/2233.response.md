The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The states of `piece`, `ncur`, and `parent` are impacted by this assignment. The value of `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur`, and the second value at the same index is now `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent` reflects the initial state with the update, `queue` reflects the initial state**.
