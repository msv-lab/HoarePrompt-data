The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. The previous values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, and `ny` is -1, we can say:

- `nx` will become `1 + dx`
- `ny` will become `0 + dy`

Therefore, the Output State will include the updated values for `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`**
