The `queue` variable is modified to include a new tuple consisting of the values of `ncur` and `2`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
