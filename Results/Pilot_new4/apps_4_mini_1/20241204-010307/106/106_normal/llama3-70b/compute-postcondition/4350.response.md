The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, while `ny` is equal to `N + dy`. All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
