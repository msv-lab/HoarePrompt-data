The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, where `N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, it follows that `ny` will always be between `5` and `12`. The value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values in the two-dimensional array `A` at the position `[x][N + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions including (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][N + 1]`.**
