The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` is less than `N`, meaning they point to valid indices within a 2D array or matrix `A`. However, `A` itself is not defined in this state, so the specific value assigned to `ncur` cannot be determined. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `queue` is updated during the loop execution, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
