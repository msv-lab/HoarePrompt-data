According to the code, the loop iterates over pairs of coordinates (dx, dy). The loop will execute once for each pair in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and we have `nx` as 3 + `dx` and `ny` as 1 + `dy`. The loop iterates through each (dx, dy) pair, so the next pair will be (2, 1) since it is the next one in the list.

To determine the state at the next iteration, we need to calculate `nx` and `ny` for the next pair:
- For (2, 1): 
  - `nx` = 3 + 2 = 5
  - `ny` = 1 + 1 = 2
  
Now, we need to check that both `nx` and `ny` must be within the bounds of 0 to `N`. Since `N` is between 4 and 10, both `nx` (5) and `ny` (2) are within this range.

As for the other variables:
- `ncur` will be determined from the array `A[5][2]`.
- The conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` would be checked based on the values of `piece`, `dist`, and `cur`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny`, while keeping `N`, `x`, and `y` the same.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is 2**
