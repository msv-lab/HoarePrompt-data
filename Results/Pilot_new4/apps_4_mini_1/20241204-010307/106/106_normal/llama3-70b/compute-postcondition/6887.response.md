The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D list `A` at the position indexed by `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and similarly for `ny`, which is between 0 and N-1, it implies that the indices for `A` are valid. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from (x, y); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1.**
