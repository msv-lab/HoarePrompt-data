The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. The variable `N` is still between 3 and 10, and the variables `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is dependent on the specific values of `A`, `x`, and `y`, but since those specific values are not provided, we retain the expression for `ncur`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
