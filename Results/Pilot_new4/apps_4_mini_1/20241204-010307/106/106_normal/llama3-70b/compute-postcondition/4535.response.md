Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
