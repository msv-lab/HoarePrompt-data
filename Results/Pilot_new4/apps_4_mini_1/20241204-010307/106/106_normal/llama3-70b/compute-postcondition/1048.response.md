Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
