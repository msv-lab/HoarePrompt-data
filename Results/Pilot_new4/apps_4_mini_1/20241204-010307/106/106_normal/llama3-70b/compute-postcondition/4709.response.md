The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the existing `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used directly in the operation, but they do not affect any of the other variables. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][2]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`.**
