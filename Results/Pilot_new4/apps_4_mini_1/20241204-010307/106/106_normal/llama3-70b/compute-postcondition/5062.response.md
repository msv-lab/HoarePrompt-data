The code snippet provided assigns new values to the variables `nx` and `ny`, which represent the new position based on the current position `(x, y)` and the directional offsets `(dx, dy)`.

Given that `dx` and `dy` will be the second tuple from the list, which is `(1, 0)`, we can deduce that:
- `dx = 1`
- `dy = 0`

Now, `nx` and `ny` are assigned as follows:
- `nx = x + dx` 
- `ny = y + dy`

The new values for `nx` and `ny` will thus be:
- `nx = x + 1`
- `ny = y + 0`, which simplifies to `ny = y`

The initial state indicates that `dist` contains the shortest distances from `(3, 0)` to all reachable positions, but the values of `x` and `y` are not specified. However, we know `cur` is the current position, and since `dx` and `dy` do not alter the contents of `dist`, this variable remains unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the initial position `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
