The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the delta values `dx` and `dy`. The variable `x` remains unchanged at 0, and the variable `y` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the new values will depend on the specific values of `dx` and `dy`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10 and does not affect the calculation of `nx` and `ny`, and `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, we can state the output clearly.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
