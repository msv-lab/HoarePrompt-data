The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The initial state specifies that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and `nx` and `ny` are defined in terms of other variables. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged as the assignment does not modify them, but `ncur` is now defined based on the values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
