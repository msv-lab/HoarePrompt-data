Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions, `queue` contains all reachable tuples, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, and the values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
