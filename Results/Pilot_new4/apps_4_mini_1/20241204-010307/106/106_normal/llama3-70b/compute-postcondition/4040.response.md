Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` remain valid. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and an item `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
