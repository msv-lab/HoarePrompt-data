Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on piece types, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, `queue` is empty after processing all reachable positions, `cur` is the value of the last processed piece, and `piece` indicates the type of the last processed piece. If certain positions were unreachable, their corresponding entries in `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
