Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where the conditions are met, `piece` remains unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 ≤ nx < N and 0 ≤ ny < N).***
