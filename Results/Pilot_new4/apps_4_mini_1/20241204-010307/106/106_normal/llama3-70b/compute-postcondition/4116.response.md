Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains potential updated distances for valid cells, and `parent[2]` contains corresponding parents for valid cells. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, the `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`, while if `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.***
