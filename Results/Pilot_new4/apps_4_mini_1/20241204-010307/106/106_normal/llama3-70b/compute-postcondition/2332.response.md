To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the loop's structure and its dependencies on the state prior to execution.

1. The loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which represent potential movements in a grid (up, down, left, and right).
2. The loop's ability to execute does not depend on the contents of `dist[1]` or `parent[1]` directly. However, the state of the `queue` is crucial since it relates to reachable positions based on valid moves from `(x, y)`.
3. For the loop to execute successfully and potentially update the `dist` and `parent` arrays, there must be valid positions in `queue` that can be explored. If `queue` is empty, the loop will not perform any actions.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop execution are:

- The `queue` must contain at least one reachable position in order for the loop to execute and make valid moves.
- The current position `(x, y)` must be defined and should correspond to a position from which valid moves can be made.

Taking these points into account, the following must be stated:

State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` must contain at least 1 reachable position, and `(x, y)` must be a valid position corresponding to the current state of exploration.**
