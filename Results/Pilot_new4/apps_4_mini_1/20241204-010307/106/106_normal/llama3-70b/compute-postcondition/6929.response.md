The code updates the `dist` array at position `[0][ncur]` to be equal to the value at `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. Since the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, we simply need to describe the new value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

The output state will include the unchanged variables and the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
