To derive the output state, let's analyze the impact of the code snippet provided.

- The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. 
- Given that `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` will take the value of the element in matrix `A` at the position determined by `(x + 1, y)`.
- The other variables (`dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `queue`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ncur` based on the matrix `A` and the current values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is A[x + 1][y]**
