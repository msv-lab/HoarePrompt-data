Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `piece` is 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than the value of `dist[0][cur]` plus 1.***
