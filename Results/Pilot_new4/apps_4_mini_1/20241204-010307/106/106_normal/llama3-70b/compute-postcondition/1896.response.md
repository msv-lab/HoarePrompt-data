Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
