The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][y]`, and we will use this value in the next operation. The code then updates `dist[2][ncur]` with the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

Since `N` is between 4 and 10, and `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, and `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, the specific values of `cur` and `A` are unknown, but they are necessary for calculating `dist[2][ncur]`. However, since `ncur` is known to be `A[x - 1][y]`, we can denote that the operation will affect `dist[2][ncur]`, but we cannot calculate the exact final values without those specifics.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
