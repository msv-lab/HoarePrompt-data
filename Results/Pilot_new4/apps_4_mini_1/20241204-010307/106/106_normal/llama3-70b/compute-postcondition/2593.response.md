The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already defined as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`, which means that `ncur` will be assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indexes `nx` and `ny`. The variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
