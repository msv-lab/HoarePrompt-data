The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values of `x` and `y` are both 0. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `dx` and `ny` will be equal to `dy`. The initial state provides the ranges for `N`, but it does not affect the calculations for `nx` and `ny`. Thus, the output state updates `nx` and `ny` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`**
