To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which represent the changes in `x` and `y` (i.e., `dx` and `dy`).
2. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that:
   - `N` is between 4 and 10 (inclusive).
   - `x` is 4.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `piece` is 2.
   - `nx` is calculated as `4 + dx`.
   - `ny` is calculated as `1 + dy`.
3. The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple in the list.

For each iteration of the loop:
- The first iteration uses `(-1, 0)` resulting in `nx = 3`, `ny = 1`.
- The second iteration uses `(1, 0)` resulting in `nx = 5`, `ny = 1`.
- The third iteration uses `(0, -1)` resulting in `nx = 4`, `ny = 0`.
- The fourth iteration uses `(0, 1)` resulting in `nx = 4`, `ny = 2`.

After the last iteration, the states need to consider what happens next:
- The next tuple for `dx` and `dy` is not available, meaning the loop will not execute again.
- The values of `nx` and `ny` derived from the last tuple are `4 + 1` and `1 + 0`, respectively, but since the loop completes, we need to prepare for the next cycle of the loop, which will not occur.

Thus, the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop should maintain the last values of `x` and `y` and indicate that the loop has finished iterating over all pairs.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is 4, `ny` is 2**
