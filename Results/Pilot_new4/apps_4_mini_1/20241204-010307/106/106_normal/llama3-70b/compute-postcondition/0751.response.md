To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we must analyze the conditions and the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates over the tuple list `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, which means it will execute four iterations, once for each tuple.
2. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take the values from these tuples successively. After the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will have already taken the last values from the list:
   - In the last iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1.
3. Since there are no more tuples left in the list after `(1, 1)`, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, we need to prepare the state for the next iteration. However, since the loop is finished after the last tuple (as there are no more tuples to process), we indicate that the loop cannot execute again:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1 (the final values from the last iteration)**.
