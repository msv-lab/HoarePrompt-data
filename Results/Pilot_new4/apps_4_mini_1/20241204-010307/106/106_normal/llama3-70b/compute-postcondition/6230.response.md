The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the element `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of the variables `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` will now hold the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
