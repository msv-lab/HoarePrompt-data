The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the `parent` array is being modified at the position `[2][ncur]`, where `ncur` has a specific value that comes from the array `A` indexed by `nx` and `ny`. The right-hand side assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. 

Since `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, we assume that they hold some specific values that will be assigned to `parent[2][ncur]`.

The initial conditions remain the same; the only change is in the `parent` structure at the specific index.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
