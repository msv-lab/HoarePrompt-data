Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `piece` is set to 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
