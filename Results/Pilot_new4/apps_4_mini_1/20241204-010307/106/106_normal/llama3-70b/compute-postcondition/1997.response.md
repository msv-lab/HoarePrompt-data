The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `dx`, and `y` and `dy`, respectively. Since the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`, but we know they are based on those variables. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is still 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
