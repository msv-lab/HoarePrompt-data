The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the distance at the position `ncur` in the `dist` array. The condition states that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which implies that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` will now be set to a value that is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous values of `dist[0][ncur]` and `dist[0][cur]` are not specified but the update indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for updated positions, `queue` contains previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (cur, 1), the current value of `piece` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.**
