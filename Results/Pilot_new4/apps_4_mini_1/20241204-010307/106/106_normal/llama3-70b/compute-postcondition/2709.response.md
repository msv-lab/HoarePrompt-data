The assignment statement `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value at the position `[nx][ny]` of the array `A` to the variable `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` were previously defined, with `nx` being equal to `x` and `ny` being `-2`. The specific values of these variables are not known due to the absence of concrete values provided for `N`. 

However, we know:
- `A[x][-2]` is equal to `cur` (as per the initial state).
- Since `ny` is `-2`, this implies that `ncur` will be assigned the value at the last column of the array `A` at the row indexed by `nx`.

Since `A[nx][-2]` is equal to `cur`, we can now express the output state. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece` when both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1.**
