The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are confirmed to be within the bounds of the matrix `A` since both satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
