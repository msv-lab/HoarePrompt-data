The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, and `ny` is equal to `3`. Since `N` is between `3` and `10`, we must also ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true for the assignment of `ncur`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
