In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the values of `x` and `y`, incremented by `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and both `x` and `y` are between 0 and `N-1`. 

However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `nx` and `ny` are changed to depend on these unknown values.

The updated values can be expressed as:
- `nx = x + dx`
- `ny = y + dy`

The previous constraints remain relevant, so `N` remains between 3 and 10, `x` is still between 0 and `N-1`, and `y` is also within the same range. `nx` and `ny` will now be dependent on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
