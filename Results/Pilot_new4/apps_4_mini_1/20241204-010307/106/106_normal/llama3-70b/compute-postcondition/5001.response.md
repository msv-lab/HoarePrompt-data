Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting position to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the starting position to `cur` plus 1.***
