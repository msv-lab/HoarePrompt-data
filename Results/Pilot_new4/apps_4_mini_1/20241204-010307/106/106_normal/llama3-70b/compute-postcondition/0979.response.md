Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` remains 0, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
