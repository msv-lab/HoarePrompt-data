The line of code modifies the `dist` array at the specific index `[1][ncur]`, assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `cur` is not provided, but `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][8]`.

The output state will reflect that `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and it does not affect the other variables directly.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][8]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
