`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3**.
