The code updates the distance array `dist`, specifically the value at `dist[0][ncur]`. The value assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is the sum of the previous distance `dist[0][cur]` and `1`. The previous values of the variables `cur` and `ncur` remain unchanged, but the value of `dist[0][ncur]` will now reflect the updated distance.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the output state will incorporate that into the expression.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
