The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The only change is in the `queue`, which now includes the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` modified such that `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
