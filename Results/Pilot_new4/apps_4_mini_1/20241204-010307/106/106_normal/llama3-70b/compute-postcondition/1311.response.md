Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances from `cur` for reachable positions where `piece` is 2; `parent[2]` reflects the paths taken for those positions; `queue` contains all tuples of updated positions that met the conditions based on `dist` and `parent`; if there were no reachable positions, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
