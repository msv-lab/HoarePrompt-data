`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `4 + (-1) = 3`. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `0 + (-1) = -1`. The value of `N` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, and `ny` is -1.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1**
