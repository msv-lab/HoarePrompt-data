The code modifies the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. It is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The precondition states that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, so this assignment will update `dist[1][ncur]` to a value that is less than or equal to its previous value. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`**.
