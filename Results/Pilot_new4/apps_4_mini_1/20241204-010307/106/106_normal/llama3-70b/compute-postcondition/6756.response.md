The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, it can be assumed to be an empty list or not specifically defined. Therefore, after executing this code, the state of the relevant variables will reflect the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece` is associated with `parent[0][ncur]`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
