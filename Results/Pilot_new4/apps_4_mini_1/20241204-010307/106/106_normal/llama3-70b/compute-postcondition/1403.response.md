Postcondition: ***If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable states from `(x, y)` based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous positions for those states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates. If `piece` is equal to `i`, the state remains unchanged.***
