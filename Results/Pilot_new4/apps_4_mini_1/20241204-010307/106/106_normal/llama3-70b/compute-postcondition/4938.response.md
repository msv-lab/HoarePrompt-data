The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The preconditions indicate that `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the array `A`, given that both are between 0 and less than `N`. Therefore, the value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `nx`, `ny`, and the contents of the array `A`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we include all valid information about them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `nx` is `x + dx` where `dx` is within bounds; `ny` is `y + dy` where `dy` is within bounds; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
