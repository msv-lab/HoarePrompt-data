The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)` where `cur` is the current value or state and `piece` has the value of 2. The variable `ncur` has already been assigned the value `A[nx][0]`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][0]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`**.
