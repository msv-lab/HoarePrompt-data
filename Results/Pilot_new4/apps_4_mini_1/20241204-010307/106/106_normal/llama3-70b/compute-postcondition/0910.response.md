Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid moves from `(x, y)` using the defined deltas, `parent[0]` has been set for valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples of all reachable cells from `(x, y)` where conditions were satisfied. If no valid moves were found, `dist[0]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
