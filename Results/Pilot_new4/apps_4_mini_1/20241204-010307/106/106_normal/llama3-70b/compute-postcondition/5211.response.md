The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are the elements of the tuple being added. Other variables remain unchanged, and we maintain the existing state of the initial variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
