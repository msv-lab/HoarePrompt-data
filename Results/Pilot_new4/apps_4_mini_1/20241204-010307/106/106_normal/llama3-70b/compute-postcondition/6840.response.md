According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). Each iteration will apply a different offset to the current position to check neighboring values in the array `A`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, and `N` is between 3 and 10. The values `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple in the list: 
- If the loop has not yet processed the last tuple, we can simply say the next value `(dx, dy)` will be the next tuple in the list. 
- If the loop is at the last tuple, it will not execute again.

Since there are 8 tuples in the list and no specific index or state of the loop is provided, we cannot determine exactly which tuple will be processed next. However, we can state that the variables `dx` and `dy` will take the next tuple from the list.

Thus the states need to be adjusted for the loop's next iteration as follows:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + next_dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + next_dy` where `(next_dx, next_dy)` is the next tuple in the list**
