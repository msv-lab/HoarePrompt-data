Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.***
