Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; `cur`, `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1; `dx` and `dy` have been reset to the first tuple (-1, -1); `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
