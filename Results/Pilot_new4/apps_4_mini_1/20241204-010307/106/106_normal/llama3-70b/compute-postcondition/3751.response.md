The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used directly for this operation, where `ncur` is already defined as equal to `A[1][0]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

The output state reflects that the queue now has an additional element, which is the tuple consisting of `ncur` and `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
