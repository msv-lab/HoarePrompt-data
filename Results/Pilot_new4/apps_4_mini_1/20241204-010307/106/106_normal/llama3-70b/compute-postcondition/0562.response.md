The line of code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

Given:
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `y` is 0
- The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state but are assumed to be defined and will affect the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Thus, `nx` will be calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` will be calculated as `0 + dy`, which simplifies to `dy`.

The initial constraints on `N`, `y`, and `x` are still valid after the execution, and the new variables `nx` and `ny` are introduced.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position, `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions.**
