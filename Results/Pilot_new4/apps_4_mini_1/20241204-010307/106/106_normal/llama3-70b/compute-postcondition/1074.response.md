The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the queue, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `0 + dy`, it retains its specific relationship with `dx` and `dy`. However, the exact value of `ncur` depends on the values in the array `A`. There is no change to `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, or `parent` as a result of this line of code.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
