To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop operates based on the provided values. The loop iterates over tuples of `(dx, dy)` from the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already picked the first tuple `(-1, -1)` for iteration. The next tuple in sequence will be `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)`, and then `(1, 1)`. 

The loop will execute a total of four times, once for each direction specified in the list. Since we have not reached the end of the list (as we have only processed the first tuple), we need to prepare for the next iteration.

Thus, to update the state for the next iteration:

- The tuple that will be taken next is `(-1, 1)`.
- All other state variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `cur`, `piece`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged since there are no conditions met that would alter them during the loop.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the next tuple while keeping the rest of the variables the same:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`.**
