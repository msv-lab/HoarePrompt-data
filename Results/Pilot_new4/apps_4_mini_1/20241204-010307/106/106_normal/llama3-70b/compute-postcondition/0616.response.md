The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, but they are assumed to be valid for appending to the queue. Other variables remain unchanged as the operation only affects the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` is updated with the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for piece 2, `parent[2]` tracks the previous position and piece for each reachable position for piece 2, `queue` now contains `(cur, i)` added during the loop execution.**
