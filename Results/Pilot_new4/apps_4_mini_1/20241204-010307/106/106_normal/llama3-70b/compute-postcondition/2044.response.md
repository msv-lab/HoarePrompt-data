According to the code, the for loop is iterating over a list of tuples representing movement directions (dx, dy). Since the loop does not have conditions that depend on the state of other variables, it will execute regardless of the states of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `queue`, and `ncur`. 

The loop will execute a fixed number of times (specifically, 4 times for each tuple in the list). Therefore, the states that need to be indicated before the loop starts can remain as they are, but it is important to note that `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples being iterated over.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` will take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `ncur` is the value obtained from `A[nx][ny]` for all valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates.**
