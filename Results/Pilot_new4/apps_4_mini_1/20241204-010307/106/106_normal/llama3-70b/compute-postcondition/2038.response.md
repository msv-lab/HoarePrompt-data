The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous value of `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged, and the value of `ncur` is determined by the matrix `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Given that `N` is at least 5, `i` is less than 8, and `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, the state of `dist[0][ncur]` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value which was `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, `i` is less than 8, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
