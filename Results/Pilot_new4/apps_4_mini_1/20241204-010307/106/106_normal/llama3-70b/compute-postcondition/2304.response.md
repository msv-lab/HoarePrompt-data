Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` may be updated based on the valid moves from `(x, y)` given by the pairs `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. If a move results in `nx` and `ny` being within the bounds `[0, N)`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` will be updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` will include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If none of the conditions are met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged.**
