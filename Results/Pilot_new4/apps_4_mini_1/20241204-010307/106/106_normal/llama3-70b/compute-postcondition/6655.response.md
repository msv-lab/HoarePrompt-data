According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `dx` and `dy`. These values are being iterated over a predefined list of tuples. Since the loop will always execute as long as there are tuples in the list, we must ensure that the loop is capable of using the given states correctly.

The key points to consider:
1. The loop will execute for every tuple in the list of directions, so there are no specific conditions on `N`, `x`, and `y` that affect the loop's execution.
2. The variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` should be initialized correctly according to the context, but they will be used within the loop's body, which is omitted. Therefore, their values at the start of the loop are essential for what happens inside the loop but do not affect the loop's execution itself.
3. The tuple `(cur, i)` being appended to `queue` is based on the condition whether `piece` is equal to `i` or not, affecting the content of `queue`.

Since there are no adjustments needed for the loop itself to start iterating through the tuples, we need to ensure that the variables have sensible initial values concerning the context provided.

State: **`N` is between `3` and `10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) with `(cur, i)` appended to `queue` if `piece` is not equal to `i`**
