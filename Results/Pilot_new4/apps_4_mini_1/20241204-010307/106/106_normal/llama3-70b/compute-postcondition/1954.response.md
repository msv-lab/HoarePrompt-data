The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. This indicates that the new state of the queue will include the variable `ncur` (which is equal to `A[nx][ny]`) and the integer `0`, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged.

The relevant initial states are:
- `N` is at least 4
- `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices
- `piece` remains unchanged at 0
- `y` is 4
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`

Since the `queue` variable is being modified by appending the tuple and no other variables are directly changed, the output state will reflect the inclusion of `(ncur, 0)` in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
