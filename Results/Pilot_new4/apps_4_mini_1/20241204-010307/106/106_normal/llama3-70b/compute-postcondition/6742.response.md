The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are given as 1 and 2. However, the variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact values for `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, `piece` must not equal `i` for `(cur, 2)` to be added to `queue`, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
