To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and the conditions surrounding the execution of the loop's body. 

The loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional moves `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. For each iteration, it will likely check some conditions based on these directional changes, though the specifics of those conditions are omitted since the loop body is not provided.

The variables given are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is initialized to `0`.
- `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`.

Based on the loop's purpose of updating `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, we can deduce that `cur` and `ncur` (where `ncur` represents the new current position after applying the directional move) must be valid indices with respect to the structures being referenced.

For the loop to execute correctly:
1. We need to ensure that `cur` is within valid board boundaries based on `N`. 
2. After applying a directional move (given by `dx` and `dy`), `ncur` must also remain within the valid range of indices.
3. The loop body will likely check conditions that depend on the current state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, so their initial states should be properly defined.

Given these considerations, the adjustments needed before the loop execution are:
- `ncur` should be initialized based on the current position `cur` and the directional moves applied within the loop.
- The conditions involving `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` must reflect that they have initialized states that allow for the potential updates during loop execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is valid index, `ncur` is a valid index after applying (dx, dy), `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are initialized and ready for updates**.
