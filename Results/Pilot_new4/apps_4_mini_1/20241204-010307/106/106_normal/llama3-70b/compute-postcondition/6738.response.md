Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized values.***
