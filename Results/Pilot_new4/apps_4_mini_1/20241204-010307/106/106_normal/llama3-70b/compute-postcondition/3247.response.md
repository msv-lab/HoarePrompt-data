The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The values are computed as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. The variables `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
