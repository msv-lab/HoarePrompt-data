According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples containing the pairs of `dx` and `dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are modified at each iteration, the loop will execute once for each pair in the provided list.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop had `dx` as -2 and `dy` as -1. For the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take the next values from the list. The next pair after (-2, -1) in the list is (-2, 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, `dx` will be -2 and `dy` will be 1. The loop has 8 pairs in total, so as long as the last iteration has not reached the end of the list, it can execute again.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is undefined.**
