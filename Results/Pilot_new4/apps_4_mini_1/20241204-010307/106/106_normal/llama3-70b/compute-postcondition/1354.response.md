The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and since the operation involves appending to a list, it does not alter any existing values. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves plus `(ncur, 1)`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the update.**
