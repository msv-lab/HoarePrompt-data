The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the tuples from `dx` and `dy`. Given the initial values, `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`. The tuples `dx` and `dy` can take four different combinations: 

1. `(-1, -1)`
2. `(-1, 1)`
3. `(1, -1)`
4. `(1, 1)`

For each combination:

1. For `(-1, -1)`:  
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
   - `ny = 2 + (-1) = 1`
   
2. For `(-1, 1)`:  
   - `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
   - `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`

3. For `(1, -1)`:  
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - `ny = 2 + (-1) = 1`

4. For `(1, 1)`:  
   - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`

Thus, after the operation, the values of `nx` and `ny` will vary based on which combination of `dx` and `dy` is used during the iterations. Since the specific combination is not provided, we can represent the outcomes as possible values for `nx` and `ny`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1, 3**.
