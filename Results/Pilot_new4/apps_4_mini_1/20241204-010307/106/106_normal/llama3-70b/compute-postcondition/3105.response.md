According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which contains 4 pairs of values. The loop will execute once for each pair of `(dx, dy)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` represent the values of the last pair in the list. Since the loop iterates through all 4 pairs, and `y` is currently set to 2, the loop would have executed for `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)` in that order.

Since there are no more pairs to iterate through, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, the next state reflects that there are no changes to the values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, as all changes have already been made based on the last set of pairs.

State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if it was greater, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made.**
