Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece` is 0 if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the variables.***
