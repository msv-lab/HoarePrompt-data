Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated based on valid moves; `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes based on valid moves; `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples depending on the conditions met during iterations; all `dx` and `dy` combinations have been iterated through.**
