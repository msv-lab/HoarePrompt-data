The initial state indicates that `x` is currently 0 and `y` is currently 1. The code snippet defines `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` and `dy` are both assigned the value of 1 in the last iteration, we can proceed with the calculation:

```
nx = x + dx = 0 + 1 = 1
ny = y + dy = 1 + 1 = 2
```

The values of `nx` and `ny` are now updated to 1 and 2, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, now including `(ncur, 1)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; since `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; additionally, `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)` if `nx` and `ny` are within bounds; `dx` and `dy` have been assigned `(1, 1)` in the last iteration.**
