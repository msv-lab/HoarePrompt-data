Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, and `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`. If the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, and `queue` includes all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples for all valid knight moves. If `piece` is 2, for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)` for all valid `ncur` positions. Additionally, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` stays the same.***
