The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `1` are being appended, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Since the values of `ncur` and the contents of `queue` are not explicitly stated in the initial state, we will simply indicate the change in the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
