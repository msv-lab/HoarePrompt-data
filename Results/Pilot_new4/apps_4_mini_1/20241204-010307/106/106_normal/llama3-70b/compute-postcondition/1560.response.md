The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are assumed to be valid, while the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**.
