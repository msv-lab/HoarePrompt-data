The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The code calculates `nx` as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will remain equal to `y`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected; therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0**.
