The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are dependent on `x` and `dx`, `y` and `dy`, respectively. The state of `N` remains unchanged as it specifies the range of values. The values of `nx` and `ny` are still valid as they are within the bounds of 0 and `N`. However, since the specific indices `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`, we cannot determine exact values without knowing them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`, and `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples in each iteration.**
