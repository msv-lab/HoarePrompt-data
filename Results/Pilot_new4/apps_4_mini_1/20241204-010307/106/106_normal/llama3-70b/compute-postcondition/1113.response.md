According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples regardless of the current values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. Thus, the loop can execute as long as the list of direction tuples is non-empty, which it is.

However, the meaningful state changes during the loop body are contingent on the values of `piece`, `dist`, and the conditions regarding valid `(nx, ny)` positions. Specifically, for the loop to contribute to any updates in `dist`, there must be valid positions computed from `(x, y)` using the direction tuples. 

Given the information provided:
1. The loop can execute as the directions are defined.
2. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` suggest that there are valid positions since `N` is between 3 and 10, which generally implies a grid or matrix of significant size.
3. The loop would typically check for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, but we do not know the grid's boundaries, so we cannot determine the validity of the positions.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted minimally, ensuring that the loop can execute and acknowledging the potential for updates to `dist` and `queue`:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dist` is initialized, `parent` is initialized, `queue` can potentially be empty or initialized, and valid `(nx, ny)` positions can be computed based on `(x, y)` and direction tuples.**
