In this case, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both 1, meaning that `ncur` will be the value located at the first row and first column of the array `A`. The array `A` itself is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur` without that information. The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` holds the value at `A[1][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is A[1][1]**.
