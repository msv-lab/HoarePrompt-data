The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the variable `parent[1][ncur]` is being assigned a tuple consisting of the values of `cur` and `piece`. The variables `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged apart from the new assignment to `parent[1][ncur]`. 

Since `parent` is being updated to include the values of `cur` and `piece`, the initial state remains valid with the exception of the new value for `parent[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and the values of `queue` remain unchanged.**
