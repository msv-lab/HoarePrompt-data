The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `y` is initially 0, `ny` becomes equal to `dy`. The variable `x` is known to be greater than 0 and less than `N - 1`. Therefore, the value of `nx` will depend on the current value of `x` and `dx`.

Given that `dx` can either be -1 or 1 (to fulfill the constraints of `x`), `nx` will represent the value of `x` shifted by `dx`, which means it can be either `x - 1` or `x + 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy` (where `y` is 0, thus `ny` is equal to `dy`).**
