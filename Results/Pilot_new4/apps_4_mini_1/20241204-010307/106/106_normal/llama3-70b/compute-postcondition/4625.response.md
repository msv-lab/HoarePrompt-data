Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, and `queue` must include the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents. If the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are within bounds, and `piece` is equal to 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
