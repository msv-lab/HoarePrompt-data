The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, modified by `dx` and `dy` respectively. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of those variables. The previous values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged except for the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0 or 1, and updated `dist` and `parent` if applicable.**
