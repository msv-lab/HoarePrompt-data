The values of `nx` and `ny` are recalculated based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `ncur`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, and `queue` contains reachable positions.**
