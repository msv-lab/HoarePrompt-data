According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of tuples that represent changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. There are a total of 8 tuples in the list. The loop will execute one more time if it has not yet finished iterating through all tuples. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is within the range [0, N-1], `y` is within the range [0, N-1], and the current tuple `(dx, dy)` has been processed. The loop iteration variable `(dx, dy)` will be updated in the next iteration to the next tuple in the list. 

Given that there are 8 possible tuples and assuming the loop has processed `k` tuples so far, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be less than 8. 

If the last processed tuple was the `k-th` one, then in the next iteration the tuple would be the `(k+1)-th` one.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:
- The loop will move to the next tuple `(dx, dy)`, which corresponds to `k + 1` where `k < 8`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx, dy` corresponds to the next tuple `(dx, dy)` for `k + 1` where `k < 8`.**
