The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[1][ncur]` variable. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is derived from the grid context using `nx` and `ny`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated based on the values of `dist[1][cur]`. However, no other variables are affected, and the integrity of the rest of the state remains intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), the value of `piece` is 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
