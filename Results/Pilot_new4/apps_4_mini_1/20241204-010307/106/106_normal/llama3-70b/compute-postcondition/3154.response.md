Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from `cur` to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, and `cur` is the value of the last processed piece. If no positions were reachable from the initial state, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
