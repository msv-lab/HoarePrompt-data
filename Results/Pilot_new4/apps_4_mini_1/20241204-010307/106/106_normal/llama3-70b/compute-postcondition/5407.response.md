Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the new move `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made.***
