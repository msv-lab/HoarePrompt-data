The `queue` variable is updated to include the new value `(ncur, 2)`, where `ncur` is the current value determined by `A[nx][ny]`. The previous state of `queue` contained the tuples `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)` as indicated. Therefore, after appending, the state of `queue` will include another tuple with `ncur` and the value `2`.

Other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `queue` while retaining all other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)`, `(ncur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`**.
