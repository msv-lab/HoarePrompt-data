`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `4 + 1`, resulting in `5`. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `1 + 1`, resulting in `2`. The values of `N`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is 2**
