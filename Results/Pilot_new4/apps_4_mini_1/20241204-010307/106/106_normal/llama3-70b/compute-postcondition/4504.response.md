Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist` or `parent`.***
