Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, and `ny` is `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the state of the variables. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to the state of the variables.***
