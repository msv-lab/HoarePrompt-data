The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the condition that a new item has been appended to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, with `dist[0][ncur]` previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and an item `(ncur, 0)` has been appended to `queue`.**
