The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of the variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects the assignment to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
