The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` corresponds to `A[nx][ny]`, which remains unchanged after this operation. The other variables are not affected. 

Since we do not have the specific values of `cur` and `piece`, we will represent them generically. The unaffected variables retain their precondition values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
