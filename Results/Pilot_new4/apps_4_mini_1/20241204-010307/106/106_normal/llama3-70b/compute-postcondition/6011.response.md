Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0 (for the first iteration), and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
