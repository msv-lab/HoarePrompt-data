According to the code, the loop will execute for each pair `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This list has 4 pairs, so the loop will always execute regardless of the current values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. 

However, while `N` is an integer between 3 and 10 and `y` is 2, we don't have any specific conditions that affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop's execution is solely determined by the fixed array of pairs. 

Given the context of the loop, it is also important to note that `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` may be affected inside the loop, but since we are only focused on the state before the loop execution, we don't need to adjust those variables for the loop to run.

Thus, the only relevant states before the loop starts are those that confirm the values of `N` and `y`, as they are given but do not influence the execution of the loop itself. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2**
