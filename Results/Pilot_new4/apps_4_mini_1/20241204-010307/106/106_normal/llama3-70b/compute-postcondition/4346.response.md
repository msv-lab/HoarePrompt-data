Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions based on the conditions of `piece` and `dist[1][cur]`; `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions based on their relationships; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for all valid positions processed during the loop execution; `nx` and `ny` represent all possible neighbor coordinates generated from the loop iterations, and `ncur` takes values from `A[nx][ny]` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions. In the case no updates happen, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` maintain their prior values.**
