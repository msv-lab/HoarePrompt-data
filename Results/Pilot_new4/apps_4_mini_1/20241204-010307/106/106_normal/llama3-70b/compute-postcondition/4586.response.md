The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Since the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this means `dist[1][ncur]` will now be updated to a smaller value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` contains parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` contains potential next states, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
