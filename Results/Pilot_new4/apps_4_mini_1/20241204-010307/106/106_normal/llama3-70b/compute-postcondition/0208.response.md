Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N - 2`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][N - 2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
