The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. Since `cur` and `i` are variables which can hold any values, this operation does not change the values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, or `piece`. The only change occurs in the `queue`, which now includes a new entry.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` remains 2, and `queue` now contains an additional entry `(cur, i)`**.
