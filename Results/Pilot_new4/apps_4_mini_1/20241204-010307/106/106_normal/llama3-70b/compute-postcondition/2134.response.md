The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and the variable `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided explicitly in this context, but they are assumed to be defined within the program. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State should reflect the assignments made to `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is 0, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
