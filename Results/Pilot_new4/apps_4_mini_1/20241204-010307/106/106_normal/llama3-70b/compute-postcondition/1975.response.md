Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
