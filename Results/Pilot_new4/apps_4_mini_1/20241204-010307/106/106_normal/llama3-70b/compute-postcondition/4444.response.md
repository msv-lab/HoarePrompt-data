The variable `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. Given that the last valid `(dx, dy)` was (0, 1), this means that `nx` will be equal to `x + 0`, which simplifies to `x`, and `ny` will be equal to `y + 1`. Since `y` is equal to `N`, `ny` therefore becomes `N + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and there are no more tuples to process in the list.**
