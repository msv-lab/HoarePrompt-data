The code snippet updates the values of variables `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, this means:
- `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` will remain equal to `y` since it is unaffected by the addition of `dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
