The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and assigns `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]` as well. The specific values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not given in the initial state, but they will affect the output state if they take on specific values during execution.

The initial state of the variables is as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10
- `y` is 2
- `piece` is 0
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1
- `ny` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `parent[0][ncur]` will have the value of `cur`, and also `piece` will be associated with `parent[0][ncur]`. In this context, since `piece` is 0, it will be stored in the same location as `cur`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the changes made by the code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
