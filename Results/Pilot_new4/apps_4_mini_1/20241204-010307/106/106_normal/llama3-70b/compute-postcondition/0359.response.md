According to the code, the for loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing pairs of coordinates (dx, dy). The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N` and `y`, as the loop does not depend on these variables for its execution.

However, I need to ensure that the variables `dx` and `dy` are correctly initialized for the first iteration. At the start of the loop, `dx` should be -2 and `dy` should be -1, as they are the first values in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
