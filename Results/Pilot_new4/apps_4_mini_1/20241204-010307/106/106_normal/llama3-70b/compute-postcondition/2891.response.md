Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate which is now `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions if `piece` is 2, while `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of those positions, and `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is 1, then `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` retains the tuple `(cur, i)`. In either case, `piece` is not equal to `i` and `N` must be greater than `y + 1.`***
