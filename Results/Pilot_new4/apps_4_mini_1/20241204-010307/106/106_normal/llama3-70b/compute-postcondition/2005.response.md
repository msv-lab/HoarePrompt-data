The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The initial state indicates that `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y`. Hence, `ncur` will take the value from the 2D array `A` at the position determined by `nx` (which is `x - 1`) and `ny` (which is `y`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
