The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged in this operation. The other variables retain their initial state as well. 

The state of `queue` will now include the newly appended tuple, and the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and the `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
