The code assigns the value `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Since we know that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this assignment will update `dist[2][ncur]` to a new value which is `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

The values of `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, except for `dist[2][ncur]`, which now holds the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions; `parent[0]` indicates predecessors for reachable positions; `dist[1]` holds shortest distances for positions reachable with piece value 1; `parent[1]` indicates predecessors for those positions; `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is less than or equal to the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]`.**
