Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the impact of the code can be evaluated as follows:

1. The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively.
2. The variable `y` is equal to `N`, therefore `ny` becomes `N + dy`.
3. As `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, the value of `nx` depends on the specific values of `x` and `dx`, but it will remain unchanged aside from its new assignment.
4. The values of other variables such as `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not affected by the assignment to `nx` and `ny`, so they remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows, reflecting the updates made to `nx` and `ny`:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
