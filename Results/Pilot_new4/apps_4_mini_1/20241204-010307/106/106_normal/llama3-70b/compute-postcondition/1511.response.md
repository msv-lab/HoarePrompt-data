The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 2, `dx` is -2, `y` is 2, and `dy` is -1, we can calculate:

- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-2) = 0`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + (-1) = 1`

The new values for `nx` and `ny` replace the previous undefined states. The initial conditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, and `(dx, dy)` are still valid except for the updated values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `(dx, dy)` is (-2, -1), `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1**.
