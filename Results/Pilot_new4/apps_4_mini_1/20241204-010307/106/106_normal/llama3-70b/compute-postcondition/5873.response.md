Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is greater than the distance to `cur` plus 1, i.e., `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
