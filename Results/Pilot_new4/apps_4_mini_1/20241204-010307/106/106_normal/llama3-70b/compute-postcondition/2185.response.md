Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices and `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index. If `nx` is between 0 and N and `ny` is between 0 and N, and if `piece` is 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, with `queue` updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
