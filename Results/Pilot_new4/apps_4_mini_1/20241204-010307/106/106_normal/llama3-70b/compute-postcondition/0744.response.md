Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step.

1. The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`. Given that `dx` is `1`, this means `nx = x + 1`.
2. The variable `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `dy` is `1`, this means `ny = y + 1`.

From the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is `2 + dy`, and since `dy` is `1`, we can deduce that `y = 3`.
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`.

Therefore, we can summarize the changes:
- `nx` will be `x + 1`.
- `ny` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.

The output state includes all the unchanged values and the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4.**
