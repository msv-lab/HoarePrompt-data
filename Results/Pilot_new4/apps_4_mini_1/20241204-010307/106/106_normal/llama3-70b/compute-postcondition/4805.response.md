The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables suggest that `ncur` has been assigned a value from the `A[nx][ny]`, and `2` is a constant value being added to the tuple. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is `dx`, `y` is `dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` have been updated for all reachable positions, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
