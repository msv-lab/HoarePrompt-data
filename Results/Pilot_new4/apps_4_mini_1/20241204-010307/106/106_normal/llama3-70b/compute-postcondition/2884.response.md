The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to it. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged from their previous values. Other variables (`N`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`) remain unchanged as well. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` is updated at index [2][cur] to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated at index [2][ncur] to be equal to `(cur, piece)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` is updated at index [2][cur] to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated at index [2][ncur] to be equal to `(cur, piece)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` has appended `(ncur, 2)`**.
