The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are included in the tuple being appended. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
