In the code snippet provided, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`, which is a specific element in the array `A` based on the index `x - 2` and `0`.
2. The variable `cur` is also a specific value, which is `A[x][y]`, and since `y` is -1, `cur` refers to an element in the array `A` based on the index `x` and `-1`.
3. The expression `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be one more than `dist[0][cur]`. The value of `dist[0][cur]` is not specified in the initial state, but its value is now incremented by `1`.

The other variables that are not affected remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
