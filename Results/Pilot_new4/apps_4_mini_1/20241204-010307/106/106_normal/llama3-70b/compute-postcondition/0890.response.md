The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but we can assume they retain their values from the context of their use. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as the operation only affects `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, both `nx` is between 0 and N, and `ny` is between 0 and N, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
