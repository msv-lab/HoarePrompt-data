Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples including `parent[2][ncur]` as `(cur, 2)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` while being greater than `dist[2][cur]` if the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` is true.***
