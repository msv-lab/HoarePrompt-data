The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects the assignment of `parent[0][ncur]` to the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
