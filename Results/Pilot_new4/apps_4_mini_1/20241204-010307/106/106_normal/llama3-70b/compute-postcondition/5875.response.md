The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, while `parent` at index `[0][ncur]` is updated with the new tuple value. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and `dist` are still valid after execution, but `parent` has changed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur] is assigned the value (cur, piece)**.
