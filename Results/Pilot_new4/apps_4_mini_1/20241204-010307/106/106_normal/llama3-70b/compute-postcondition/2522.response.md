Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
