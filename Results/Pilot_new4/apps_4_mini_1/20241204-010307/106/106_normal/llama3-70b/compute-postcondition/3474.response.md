Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` has been updated to `x + dx` for each valid (dx, dy) pair; `y` has been updated to `y + dy` for each valid (dx, dy) pair; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`; `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` appended during the execution; distances from `dist[1][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; if no positions were reachable from `(1, 0)`, then `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged; the final values of `dist[1][ncur]` represent the shortest path cost to reach each corresponding `ncur` position from `(1, 0)` depending on the state updates done during the loop executions.**
