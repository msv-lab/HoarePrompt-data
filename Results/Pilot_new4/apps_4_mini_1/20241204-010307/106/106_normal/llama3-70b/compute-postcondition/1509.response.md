Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `ncur` is included in `queue` at index 0; otherwise, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
