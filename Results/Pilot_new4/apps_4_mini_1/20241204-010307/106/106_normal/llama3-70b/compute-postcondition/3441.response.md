`ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 1. However, the initial state does not provide the specific values of the array `A` or the values at the indices `-1` and `1`. Since `nx` is an index that is out of bounds (as arrays typically start at index 0), the execution may lead to an error or undefined behavior.

Considering the information provided, we can't determine a valid value for `ncur`. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged since we have no valid assignment for `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is undefined due to out-of-bounds indexing.**
