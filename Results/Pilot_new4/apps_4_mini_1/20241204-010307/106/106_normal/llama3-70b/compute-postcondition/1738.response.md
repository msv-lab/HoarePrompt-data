The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. Since no specific values for `cur` and `piece` are provided, we can't determine their exact values. However, the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 2 and `N-1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
