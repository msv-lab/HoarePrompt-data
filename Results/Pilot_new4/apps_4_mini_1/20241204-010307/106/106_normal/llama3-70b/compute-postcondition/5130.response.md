Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, we analyze the impact of the code:

- The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of the element located at the coordinates `[nx][ny]` in the array `A`. 
- The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `4` and `2`, respectively.

Since `A` is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur`. However, we acknowledge that `ncur` will hold the value of the element at position `[4][2]` in the array `A`.

The other variables maintain their values as no operations have been performed on them.

Output State: **`0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 4, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is A[4][2]**
