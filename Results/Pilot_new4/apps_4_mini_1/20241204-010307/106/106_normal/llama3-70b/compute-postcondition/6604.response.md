Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, and `queue` contains reachable positions. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` also includes (ncur, 1), `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece).***
