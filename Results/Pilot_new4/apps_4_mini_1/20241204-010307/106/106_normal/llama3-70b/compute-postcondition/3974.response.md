The code assigns `nx` and `ny` the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be equal to `dx` and `dy`. Since the loop will iterate 4 times with `dx` and `dy` taking values from a list, `nx` and `ny` will be updated accordingly in each iteration, but the specific values of `dx` and `dy` for each iteration are not provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty; `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy` with `dx`, `dy` taking values from the list over 4 iterations.**
