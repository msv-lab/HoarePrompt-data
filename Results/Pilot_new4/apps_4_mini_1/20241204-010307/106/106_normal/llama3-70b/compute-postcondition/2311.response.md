The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent[1][ncur]`. Therefore, the value of `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, which means `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the pair of values `cur` and `1` since `piece` is `1`. The other variables' states remain unchanged, and the given conditions about `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `queue` still hold.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `dist` remains unchanged except `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 1)`, `queue` remains unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment.**
