The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The state of the `queue` variable changes as a result of this operation. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values continue to hold.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` now includes an additional entry `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 2, `dist[2][ncur]` equals `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
