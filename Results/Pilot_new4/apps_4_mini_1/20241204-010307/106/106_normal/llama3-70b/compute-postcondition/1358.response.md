`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The value of `x` is 2, and the value of `y` is 0. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so they remain unspecified. The constraints on `N` do not directly affect this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`**
