`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, the updated values will be `nx = x - 1` and `ny = y + 1`. The conditions provided earlier remain valid. 

The output state is:
- `N` is between 4 and 10
- `x` is between 0 and `N-1`
- `y` is between 1 and `N-1`
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`**
