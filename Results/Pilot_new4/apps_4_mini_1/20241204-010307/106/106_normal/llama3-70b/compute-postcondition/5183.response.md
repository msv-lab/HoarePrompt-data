The operation `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` cannot be performed because `ncur` is undefined. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `nx` is undefined, `ny` is undefined, `ncur` is undefined, and the operation cannot be performed due to `ncur` being undefined.**
