The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is -1, `nx` will become `x + 1` and `ny` will become `y - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`.

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]**
