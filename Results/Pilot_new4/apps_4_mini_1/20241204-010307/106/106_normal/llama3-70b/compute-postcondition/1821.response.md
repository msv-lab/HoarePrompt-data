In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 1.

Calculating the new values:
- `nx` = `x + dx` = `x + 0` = `x`
- `ny` = `y + dy` = `2 + 1` = `3`

Thus, after executing the code, `nx` will be equal to `x`, and `ny` will be equal to `3`. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and `piece` continues to hold the value of `2`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 3**
