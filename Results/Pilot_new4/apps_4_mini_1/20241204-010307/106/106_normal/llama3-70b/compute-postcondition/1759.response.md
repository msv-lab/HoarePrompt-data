The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, and `ny` is 3. The initial state specifies that `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`, meaning both indices are valid for accessing the 2D list `A`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
