The code updates the `dist` array based on the values of `ncur` and `cur`. Since `cur` remains unchanged, we can focus on how `dist[0][ncur]` is affected. 

The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. Therefore, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1 + dx][2 + dy]`. 

The operation modifies the entry `dist[0][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. This means we need to know the previous value of `dist[0][cur]` to determine the new value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Assuming that `dist[0][cur]` has a known value, we can represent that as `X`. Then, `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `X + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `cur` remains unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1 + dx][2 + dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
