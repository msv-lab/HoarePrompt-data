Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `parent` or `queue`.***
