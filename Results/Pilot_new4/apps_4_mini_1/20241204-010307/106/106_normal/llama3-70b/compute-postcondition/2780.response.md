The code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns to `dist[2][ncur]` the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The initial condition states that the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, meaning that `dist[2][ncur]` will now be updated to a value that is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which makes it less than or equal to its previous value. 

Since the output does not affect other variables, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
