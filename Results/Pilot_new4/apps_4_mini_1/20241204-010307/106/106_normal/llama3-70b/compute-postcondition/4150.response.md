The code updates the value at `dist[1][ncur]` to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dist[1][ncur]` (which is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`) and `dist[1][cur]` (which is currently known as `dist[1][cur]`). After executing the code, `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, thus it will no longer be greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1 or 3, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
