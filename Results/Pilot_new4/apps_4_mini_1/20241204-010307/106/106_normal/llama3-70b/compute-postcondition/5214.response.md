According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the directions (`dx`, `dy`). The loop will execute for each tuple in the given list. At the end of the last iteration, we have defined `dx` as -1 and `dy` as -1.

After the last iteration, the next tuple in the list is `(-1, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` should be updated to -1 and `dy` should be updated to 1.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1.**
