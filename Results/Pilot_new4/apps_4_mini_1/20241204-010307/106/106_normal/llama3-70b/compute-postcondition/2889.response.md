Output State: **If the loop executed, `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of those positions, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`; otherwise, `piece` is 1, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)` as well. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
