According to the for loop statement, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates (i.e., `dx` and `dy`). The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, which contains four pairs: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, and `piece` is 1. The current state of `nx` and `ny` is determined by the values of `dx` and `dy` in the current iteration.

After the last iteration, the loop variable `(dx, dy)` has gone through one of the tuples, and we need to determine which pairs have been processed so far. The number of iterations is equal to the index of the current tuple being processed.

Assuming the loop has already processed three tuples (for example, the pairs `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, and `(1, -1)`), then after processing the third tuple, the next iteration would process `(1, 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to process the final tuple `(1, 1)`. Therefore, the state must reflect that the next tuple `(dx, dy)` being processed will be `(1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + 1`, `ny` is `0 + 1`, ensuring that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied for the next iteration.**
