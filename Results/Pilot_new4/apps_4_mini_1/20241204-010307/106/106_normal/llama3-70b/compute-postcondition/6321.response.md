The code snippet updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current values of `dist[0][cur]` and a constant increment of 1. The variable `cur` is equal to `A[0][0]`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Therefore, the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Given that:
- `N` remains between 3 and 10,
- `x` is still 0,
- `y` is still 0,
- `A[0][0]` remains equal to `cur`,
- `nx` stays equal to `dx`,
- `ny` remains equal to `dy`,
- `piece` continues to be 0,
- `ncur` continues to be `A[nx][ny]`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
