The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[1][ncur]`. However, the values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` have not been explicitly defined in the initial state, nor do they impact any other variables directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that occurred without changing the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
