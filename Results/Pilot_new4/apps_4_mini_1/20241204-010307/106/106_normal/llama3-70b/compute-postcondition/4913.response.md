The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, it implies that `dist[0][cur]` was less than `dist[0][ncur] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][cur]` is less than `dist[0][ncur] - 1`.**
