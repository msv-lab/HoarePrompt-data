The line of code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`, and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. Since `cur` holds a specific value before this assignment, `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; the next (dx, dy) will be (1, 0); `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2)**.
