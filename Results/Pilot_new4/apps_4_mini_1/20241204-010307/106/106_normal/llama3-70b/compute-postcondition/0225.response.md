The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[1][ncur]` remain unchanged in this execution. The output state reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` has been updated to the specified values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][N + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
