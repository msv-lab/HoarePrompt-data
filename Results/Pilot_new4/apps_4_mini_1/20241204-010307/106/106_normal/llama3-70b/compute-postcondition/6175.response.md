According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy) for dx, dy in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]]`, which contains four pairs. The loop will execute once for each pair of `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the values of `nx` and `ny` must remain within the bounds of 0 and N-1 to avoid indexing errors.

The loop has executed for one of the pairs already. Given that `dy` is currently 1, the next pair of `(dx, dy)` will result in different combinations for `nx` and `ny`.

Since the loop executes for each of the four combinations sequentially, at the start of the next iteration, we need to know which combination is currently being processed. The indices for the next iteration will depend on the order of the pairs. 

If we consider that each iteration processes one pair, and if we assume that the next iteration corresponds to the second pair in the list, then:

1. `dx` could be either -1 or 1 depending on the current iteration.
2. `dy` could be either -1 or 1 depending on the current iteration.

The loop is structured to continue until all combinations have been processed. After the last execution, it will prepare to execute for the next `(dx, dy)`. 

Thus, if this was the first iteration, after the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` would correspond to the next tuple in the list. 

Assuming the first pair `(-1, -1)` was processed, the next pair to be processed is `(-1, 1)`:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `2`**.
