The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is initially 0, `y` is also 0, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1, we can calculate:

- `nx = x + dx = 0 + (-2) = -2`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + (-1) = -1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
