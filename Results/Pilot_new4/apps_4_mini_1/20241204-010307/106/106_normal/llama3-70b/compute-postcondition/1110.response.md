Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are modified accordingly. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` reflect the changes based on the outcome of the condition.***
