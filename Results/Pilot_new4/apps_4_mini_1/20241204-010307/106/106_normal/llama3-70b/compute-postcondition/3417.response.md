Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, and `y` is `N-1`. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then all reachable positions `ncur` have their minimum distances from the original position reflected in `dist`, and the corresponding parent positions stored in `parent`. The `queue` contains all tuples `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, piece)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions after all iterations. If no valid moves were possible, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for unreachable positions. If `A[x][y]` does not equal `cur`, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged.**
