`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are known to be between 0 and `N-1`, and since `dx` and `dy` represent valid moves, `nx` and `ny` will also be within the valid range of indices based on the respective values of `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` must not be empty to ensure valid moves exist.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` must not be empty to ensure valid moves exist.**
