Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` still reflects the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[2]` still contains the parent positions corresponding to the updates made in `dist[2]`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, maintaining the previously valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples corresponding to reachable positions from the starting point.***
