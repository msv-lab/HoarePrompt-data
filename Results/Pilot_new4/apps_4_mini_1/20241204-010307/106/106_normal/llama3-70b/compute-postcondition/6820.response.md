Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3. If `nx` is between 0 and `N-1` and `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
