Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and if `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; the new value `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. If the conditions are not met, the program state remains unchanged.***
