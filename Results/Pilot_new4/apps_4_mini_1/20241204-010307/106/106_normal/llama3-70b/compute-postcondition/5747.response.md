Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1) for all valid `ncur` that met the distance condition during the iterations, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to reflect the minimum distances from `cur` for each corresponding `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and the distance condition was satisfied, and `parent[1][ncur]` holds the values `(cur, piece)` for each updated `ncur`. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for those `ncur`.**
