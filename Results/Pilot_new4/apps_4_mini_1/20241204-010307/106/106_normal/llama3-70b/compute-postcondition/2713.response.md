Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
