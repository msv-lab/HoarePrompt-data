The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. However, the specific values of `A`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ncur` are not provided, meaning we cannot determine the exact value assigned to `ncur`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `ncur` along with previous elements; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
