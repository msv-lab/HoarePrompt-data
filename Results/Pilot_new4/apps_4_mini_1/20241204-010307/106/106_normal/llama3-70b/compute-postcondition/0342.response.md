The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are added as a new element in the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
