Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions, `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions. If at least one valid position exists within the boundaries defined by `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist` will reflect the shortest distances for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `parent` will hold the predecessors for those positions, and `queue` will be updated with all reachable positions from `(1, 0)`. If no valid moves are available, then `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged and initialized, and `queue` will remain unchanged as well.**
