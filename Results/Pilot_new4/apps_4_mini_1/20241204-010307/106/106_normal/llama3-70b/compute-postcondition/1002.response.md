The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Since it was stated that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this means that `dist[1][ncur]` will now be changed to a value that is less than its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged, and their preconditions still hold true.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `dist[0]` is updated for valid `ncur` values based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0]` is assigned valid values for those `ncur` positions, `queue` contains the valid `ncur` entries that were appended during the loop execution, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` has decreased from its previous value.**
