Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples. If there are reachable positions based on the knight's moves defined in the loop, `dist` will reflect the updated distances for those positions, `parent` will contain the corresponding parent tuples, and `queue` will contain all valid tuples added during the loop execution. If no positions were reachable, the original values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
