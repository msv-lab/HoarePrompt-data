According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes (`dx`, `dy`). For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the current tuple for the next iteration is (-2, 1). The for loop will proceed to the next tuple in the list, which is (-1, -2). 

No other state variables change because the loop body is omitted and the loop simply proceeds to the next item in the predefined list. 

Thus, we need to update the state to reflect the next tuple in the loop.

State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current tuple for the next iteration is (-1, -2)**
