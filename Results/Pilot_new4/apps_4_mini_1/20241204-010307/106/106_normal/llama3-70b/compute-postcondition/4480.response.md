The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. From the initial state, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is 1. The specific values of `A`, `x`, and the resulting value of `ncur` are not provided, but we can state that `ncur` will depend on the values at those indices.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the current value of `ncur` derived from the array `A` and the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
