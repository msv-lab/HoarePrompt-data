Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, and if the condition `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
