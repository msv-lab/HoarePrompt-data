Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist` contains the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values based on the piece type conditions; `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` now contains one less reachable tuple, and `cur` and `piece` are assigned the values of the tuple that was removed from the front of `queue`.**
