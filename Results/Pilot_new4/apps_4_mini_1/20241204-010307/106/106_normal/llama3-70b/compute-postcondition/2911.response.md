The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The other variables are not affected by this operation, and the values of `ncur` and `queue` will now reflect this addition.

Given the initial state where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, after executing the code, the `queue` now contains one additional tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains the previous tuples plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
