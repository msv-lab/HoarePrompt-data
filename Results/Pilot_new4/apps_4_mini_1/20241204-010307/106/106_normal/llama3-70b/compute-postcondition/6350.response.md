The `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables retain their previous states, and the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A[0][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`**.
