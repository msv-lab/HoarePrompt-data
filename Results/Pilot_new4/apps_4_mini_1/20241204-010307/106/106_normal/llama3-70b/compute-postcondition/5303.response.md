According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the direction changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the loop will progress through the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1. The next values in the list of tuples will be `(1, -1)` and `(1, 1)`. 

Assuming that the loop is able to execute one more time, the next values for `dx` and `dy` will be updated to `1` and `-1`, respectively. 

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[3][1]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the conditions are not satisfied, no changes are made.**
