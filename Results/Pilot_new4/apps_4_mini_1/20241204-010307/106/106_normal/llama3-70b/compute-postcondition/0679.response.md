The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Since `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than the distance from `dist[2][cur]` plus 1.**
