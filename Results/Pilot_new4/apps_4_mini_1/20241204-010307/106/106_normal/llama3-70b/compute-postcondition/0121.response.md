The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not altered; thus, the other variable states remain as they were initially.

The relevant variables in the output state are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` equals `N`
- `ny` equals `N + dy`
- `nx` equals `x + dx`
- `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive)
- `piece` equals 0
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`
- `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
