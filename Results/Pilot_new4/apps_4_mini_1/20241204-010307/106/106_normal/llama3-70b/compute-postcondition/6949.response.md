The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged from the initial state, while `parent[1][ncur]` is now set to this new tuple.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `parent[1][ncur]` now reflects the current state of the program as defined by the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`.**
