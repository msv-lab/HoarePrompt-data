The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The `cur` variable presumably holds the current cell's information and `i` is some index or identifier. As a result, the `queue` now contains an additional tuple representing the current cell and the associated index. 

The values of `N`, `y`, `dist[2]`, and `parent[2]` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The only change is to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dist[2]` contains the minimum distance values for piece 2 to all reachable cells, `parent[2]` contains the corresponding previous cells for all reachable cells, `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
