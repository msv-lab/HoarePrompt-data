In the given code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `N + dy`, respectively. 

- The value of `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and `y` equals `N`, so `y` will also be between 3 and 10.
- `ny` is calculated as `N + dy`. Since `ny` must be between 0 and N (exclusive), `dy` must be a negative value that makes `N + dy` fall within that range.
- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and it is also constrained to be between 0 and N (exclusive).
- The variable `ncur` will change to `A[nx][ny]`, which means it reflects the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`.

The output state should reflect the unchanged values of the variables and the updated value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` is unchanged.**
