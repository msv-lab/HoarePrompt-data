Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1) and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now additionally contains the tuple (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1. Furthermore, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged regarding `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.***
