The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, but since `x` and `y` are constrained between 1 and `N-2`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will also be within specific bounds determined by the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
