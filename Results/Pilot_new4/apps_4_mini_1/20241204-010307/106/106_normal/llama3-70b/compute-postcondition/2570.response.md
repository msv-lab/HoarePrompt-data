Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer less than `N`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
