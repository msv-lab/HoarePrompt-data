Postcondition: ***`piece` is 0, `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 to N-1). If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. If `piece` is not 1, or if the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged.***
