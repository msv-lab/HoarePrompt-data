The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means it will be equal to `x + 0` (since `dx` is 0), thus `nx` will be equal to `x`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which means it will be equal to `y + 1` (since `dy` is 1), thus `ny` will be equal to `y + 1`.

The initial values of `N`, `piece`, and the directional deltas `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
