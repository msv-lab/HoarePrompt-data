Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is determined by the loop, `queue` contains valid tuples, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy` within the bounds of the matrix (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
