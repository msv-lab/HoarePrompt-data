The code assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous state of `parent` for the specified index is not given, but the new value for `parent[0][ncur]` is now defined. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains all valid tuples; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
