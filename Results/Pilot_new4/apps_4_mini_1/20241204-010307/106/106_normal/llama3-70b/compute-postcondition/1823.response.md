The code snippet updates a specific element in a 2D array `dist` based on the values of other variables. Specifically, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

We have the following initial conditions:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `y` is 2 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `piece` is 2 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `dx` is 0 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `dy` is 1 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `nx` is equal to `x` (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `ny` is 3 (this remains valid and unchanged).
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (this remains valid and unchanged).

The affected variables in this execution are `dist[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][cur]`. The value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be updated, but the exact values depend on the current state of the `dist` array and the variable `cur`, which is not provided.

Since `dist[2][ncur]` is calculated as `dist[2][cur] + 1`, we can summarize the update:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
