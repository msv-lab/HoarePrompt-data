Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, while `piece` remains unchanged. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
