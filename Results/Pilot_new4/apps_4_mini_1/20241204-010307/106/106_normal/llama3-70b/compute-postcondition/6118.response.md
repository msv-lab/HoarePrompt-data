The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are directly derived from `x` and `y`, respectively, and since `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, this indicates moving right in a 2D array. The conditions regarding `N`, `y`, `x + dx`, and `y + dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignment for `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`.**
