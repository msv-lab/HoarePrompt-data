Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 0, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
