The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not specifically defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `ncur` will reflect the value from the array `A` indexed by `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
