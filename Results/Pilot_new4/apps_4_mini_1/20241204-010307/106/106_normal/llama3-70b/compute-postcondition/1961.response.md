The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are confirmed to be within the bounds of the array (0 to N), the assignment will succeed.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is equal to 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is equal to 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
