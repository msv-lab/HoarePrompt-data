The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Given that `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, and `dy` is 1, the new values are computed as follows:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-1)`, resulting in `nx = -1`.
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `1 + 1`, resulting in `ny = 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
