The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. 

The initial conditions state that `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, and `y` is 0. Given that `nx` is already stated to equal `4 + 1` (which is 5) and `ny` is equal to `-1`, we can conclude the following:

1. `nx` will be `5` after the code executes, as it was already calculated as `4 + 1`.
2. `ny` will be `-1` after the code executes, as it was previously defined.

The conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` will be evaluated based on the values of `nx`, `ny`, and `N`. The variable `ncur` will only be assigned a value based on these conditions, but since `ncur` is not assigned in this code snippet, we do not change its state.

Thus, the output state will maintain the previously specified ranges and values while updating `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is -1.**
