Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` remains 0, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Additionally, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, while the current tuple for the next iteration is (-2, 1).***
