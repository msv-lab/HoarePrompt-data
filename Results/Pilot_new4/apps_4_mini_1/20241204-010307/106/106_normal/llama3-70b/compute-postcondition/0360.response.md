Given the initial state where `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1, the code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the existing values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

The variable `nx` is computed as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is -2, `nx` will be `x - 2`. The variable `ny` is computed as `y + dy`, and since `dy` is -1, `ny` will be `1 - 1`, which equals `0`.

The previous values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are:
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1

However, `x` is not provided in the initial state and remains undefined in the output. The output state will include the changes to `ny` and the expression for `nx`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**
