Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
