The code adds a new tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, except for the `queue` which gains a new element. The current value of `piece` is still not equal to `i`, and all other conditions regarding `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and the reachability of valid positions still hold.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the updated distances for all reachable valid positions from (1, 1), `parent[2]` contains predecessors for valid positions, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
