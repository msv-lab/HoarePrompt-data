Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` receives the element `(ncur, 2)`. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made to `parent` or `queue`.***
