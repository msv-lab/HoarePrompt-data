The `queue` variable is modified to include a new tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation modifies only the `queue`. The existing state of `queue` prior to this operation is unknown, but we can confirm that the new state will include the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1]` reflects predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all processed tuples including the tuple (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
