Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, and `piece` is set to 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `piece` is updated to 2. If `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue includes the new entry `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program. If the condition is not met, there are no updates to the state.***
