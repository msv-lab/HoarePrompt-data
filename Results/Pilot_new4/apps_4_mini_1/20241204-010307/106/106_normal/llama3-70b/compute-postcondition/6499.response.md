The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is between 0 and `N-1` and `y` is also between 0 and `N-1`, and considering the values for `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of these variables. The initial conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state must reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` based on the expressions provided.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**
