According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction changes defined by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. This loop will execute one more time for each direction tuple. 

Given that the current state indicates:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`,
- `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it will begin with the next direction tuple in the list. The loop starts with the first tuple `(-1, 0)` and continues through the list.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't specifically track the values of `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, or `cur`, but we know that the loop will attempt to execute for each direction:

1. The first iteration uses `(-1, 0)`.
2. The second iteration uses `(1, 0)`.
3. The third iteration uses `(0, -1)`.
4. The fourth iteration uses `(0, 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to reference the current values of `dx` and `dy` for the next state, which would be the next direction in the loop. 

Since the loop will execute through all these options sequentially, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we just need to recognize that `dx` and `dy` will take the next pair in the list. After the last direction `(0, 1)`, if the loop is to execute again, it will not, due to the absence of further directions.

Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, we would be looking for the next set of values that `dx` and `dy` would take, which cannot happen as there are no more directions left in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `dx` must be (0, 1), `dy` must be (0, 1)**
