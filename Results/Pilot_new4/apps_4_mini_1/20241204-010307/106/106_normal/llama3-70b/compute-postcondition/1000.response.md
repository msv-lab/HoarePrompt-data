Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` remains 0, `dist[0]` is updated for valid `ncur` values based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0]` is assigned valid values for those `ncur` positions, `queue` contains the valid `ncur` entries that were appended during the loop execution, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (i.e., 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
