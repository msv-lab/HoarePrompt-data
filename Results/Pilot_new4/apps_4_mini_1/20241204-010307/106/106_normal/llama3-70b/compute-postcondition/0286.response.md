The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` is equal to `A[x][0]`, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The only change is in the `dist` array at the position `[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
