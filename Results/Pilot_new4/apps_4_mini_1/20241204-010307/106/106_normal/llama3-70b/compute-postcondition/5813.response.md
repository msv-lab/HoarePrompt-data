The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`. Given that `nx` is 0 and `ny` is -1, it represents an invalid coordinate in the context of the grid defined by `N` because `ny` is out of bounds (since `0 <= ny < N`, and -1 does not satisfy this condition).

As such, there is no valid assignment for `ncur` because it attempts to access an invalid index. The other variables remain unchanged since no other operations alter them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access.**
