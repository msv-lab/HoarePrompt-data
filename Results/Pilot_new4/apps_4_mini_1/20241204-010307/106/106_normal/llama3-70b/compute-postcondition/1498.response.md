The code snippet assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `parent[0][ncur]` is now updated to a tuple combining `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1, parent[0][ncur] is updated to (cur, piece)**.
