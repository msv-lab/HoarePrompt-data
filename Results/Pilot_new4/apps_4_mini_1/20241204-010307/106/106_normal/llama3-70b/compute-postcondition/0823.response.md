Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, the program remains unchanged.***
