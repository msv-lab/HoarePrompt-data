Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer that was incremented to `y + 1` and is less than `N`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` remains greater than `dist[0][cur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
