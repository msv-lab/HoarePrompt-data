Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece` is equal to 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 1][1]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
