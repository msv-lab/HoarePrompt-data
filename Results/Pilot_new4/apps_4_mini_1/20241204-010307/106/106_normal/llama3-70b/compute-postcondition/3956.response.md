According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). Each iteration corresponds to a different movement direction. At the end of the last iteration, the state is defined by the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, `piece`, and the distance and parent arrays.

1. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples left in the list. Since the list has 8 tuples, and we are currently in an iteration, there are 7 iterations left.
2. The next iteration will use the next set of `(dx, dy)` values from the list. 
3. After the current iteration completes, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of the next tuple in the list. 

Overall, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The values of `dx` and `dy` will change to the next tuple in the list. 

Since the loop body is omitted and we assume that no other variable values are affected during this loop, the existing state values remain unchanged apart from `dx` and `dy`.

Given that the current `dx` and `dy` values correspond to the first tuple `(-2, -1)`, the next tuple will be `(-2, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**
