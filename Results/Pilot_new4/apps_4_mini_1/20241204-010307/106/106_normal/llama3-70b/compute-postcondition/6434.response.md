The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The existing states of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged based on the given initial conditions. The variable `dist[1][ncur]` now depends on the value of `dist[1][cur]`, which is not specified in the initial state. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is either -1 or 1; `ny` is either 0, 2, or both based on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
