Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable states from `(x, y)` based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the previous positions for those states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` coordinates, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were made, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` maintain their initial state.***
