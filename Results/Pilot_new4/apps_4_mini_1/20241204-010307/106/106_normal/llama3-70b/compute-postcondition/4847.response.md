Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made to the distances, parents, or queue.***
