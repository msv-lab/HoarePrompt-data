The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged as this operation only affects the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain the same as before, and other variables maintain their respective states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position and now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
