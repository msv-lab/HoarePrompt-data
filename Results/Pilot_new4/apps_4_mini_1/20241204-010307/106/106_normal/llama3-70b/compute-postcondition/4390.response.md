The variables `dx` and `dy` have values of -2 and -1, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` are known values, where `y` is equal to `N`. Therefore, `ny` will equal `y + dy`, which results in `N - 1`. Similarly, `nx` will equal `x + dx`, resulting in `x - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**.
