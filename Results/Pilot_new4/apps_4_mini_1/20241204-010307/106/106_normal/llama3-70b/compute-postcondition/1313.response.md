The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. Given the information provided in the initial state, the value of `queue` will change as it will now include the new tuple. The other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`) remain unchanged as there is no indication that they are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances from `cur` for reachable positions where `piece` is 2; `parent[2]` reflects the paths taken for those positions; `queue` now contains the new tuple `(cur, i)` in addition to previously existing tuples; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
