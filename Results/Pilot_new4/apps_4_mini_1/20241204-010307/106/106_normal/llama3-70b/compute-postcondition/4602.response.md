To analyze the impact of the code on the state, we first identify how the code affects the variables:

1. The code modifies the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 
2. The variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ncur` remain unchanged in this operation, but `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated based on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, the specific value of `dist[1][ncur]` will depend on the current values of `dist[1][cur]`.

The output state will therefore reflect that `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated without changing other variables and that `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to the previous value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
