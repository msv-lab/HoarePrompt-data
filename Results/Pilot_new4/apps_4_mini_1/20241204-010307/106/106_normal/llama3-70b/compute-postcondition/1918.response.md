The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the provided `dx` and `dy`. The previous values are `nx` = `x - 1`, `ny` = `y + 0`, `dx` = -1, and `dy` = 0. 

Calculating the new values:
- `nx` becomes `x + (-1)` which simplifies to `x - 1`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 0` which simplifies to `y`.

Thus, after the code execution, the updated values are:
- `nx` is now `x - 1`.
- `ny` remains `y`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0.**
