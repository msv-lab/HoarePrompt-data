The code snippet assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are used in this operation, but since we do not have specific values for them in the initial state, we only mention that they have been used.

The initial state contains the following information:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `y` is between 1 and N-2.
- `x` is between 1 and N-2.
- `dx` is -1.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

After running the code, the modified variable is:
- `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

The output state will reflect that assignment, while all the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
