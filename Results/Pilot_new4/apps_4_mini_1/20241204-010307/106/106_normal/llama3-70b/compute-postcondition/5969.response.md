The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged in their state.

The values of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Thus, we maintain the initial conditions for them while updating the relevant variable.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
