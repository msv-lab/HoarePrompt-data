The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`, which is calculated as `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous condition states that `dist[2][ncur]` is currently greater than this new calculated value. Therefore, after execution, `dist[2][ncur]` will now equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position; `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
