Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
