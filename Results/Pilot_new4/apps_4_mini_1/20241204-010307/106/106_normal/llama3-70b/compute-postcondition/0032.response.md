The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `piece`, `cur`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`, which have not been provided. Therefore, the information about `ncur` cannot be specific without knowing `A`, `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
