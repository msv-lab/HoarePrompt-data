In the code snippet provided, the variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `y` is 1,
- `dx` is -2,
- `dy` is -1,
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`,
- `ny` is 0,
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`,
- `piece` is 0,
- and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The execution will change the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, we have:
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
