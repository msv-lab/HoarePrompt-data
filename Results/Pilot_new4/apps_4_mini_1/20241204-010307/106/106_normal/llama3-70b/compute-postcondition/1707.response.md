According to the code, the for loop iterates through a list of tuples representing changes in the `dx` and `dy` values. Since the loop iterates over the fixed list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, it will execute a total of 4 times, once for each tuple. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will have the values corresponding to the last tuple in the list, which is `(1, 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the iteration must start again from the first tuple in the list. 

The current values of `dx` and `dy` are maintained for the loop iteration but will reset for the next call. Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `dx` should be updated back to the values of the first tuple `(-1, -1)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**
