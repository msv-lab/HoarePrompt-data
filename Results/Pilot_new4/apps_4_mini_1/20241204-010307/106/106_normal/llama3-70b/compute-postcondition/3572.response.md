The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1, we have:

- `nx` becomes `x + 0`, which simplifies to `nx = x`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which simplifies to `ny = y + 1`.

The other variables in the initial state, including `dist[1][ncur]`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1**.
