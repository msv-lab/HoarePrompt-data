The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The condition states that `dist[1][ncur]` must have been greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before this assignment, but now it will be equal to that value.

Since `dist[1][ncur]` is updated, but all other variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects only the change in `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
