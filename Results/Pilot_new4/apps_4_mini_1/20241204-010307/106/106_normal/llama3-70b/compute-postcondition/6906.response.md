The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, which represents the current position in the context of the algorithm. The variable `ncur` holds the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and since `parent` is being updated, we include its new assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
