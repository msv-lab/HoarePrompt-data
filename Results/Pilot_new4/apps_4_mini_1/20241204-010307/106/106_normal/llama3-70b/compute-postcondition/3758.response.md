The code assigns the value `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `piece` is 2, and since `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, we need to ensure that the conditions for the assignment are met. The values of `dist` and `parent` for other indices remain unchanged, and their states are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[3][0]`.**
