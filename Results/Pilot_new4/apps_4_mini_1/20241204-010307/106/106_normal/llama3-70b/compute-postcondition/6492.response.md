The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of the element in the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and both `x` and `y` are between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` and `ny` will also fall within valid indices for the array `A` given that `dx` and `dy` are also valid offsets within those ranges. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
