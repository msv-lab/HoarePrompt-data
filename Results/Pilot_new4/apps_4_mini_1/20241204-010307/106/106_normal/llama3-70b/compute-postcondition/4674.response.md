The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged, but the state of the `queue` is updated with a new entry.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` has been updated to include `(ncur, 1)`**
