To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the current state before the loop.

1. The loop iterates over a list of coordinate pairs `[(dx, dy), ...]`. This implies that the loop will execute for each pair in the list.
2. The loop will always execute a fixed number of times (specifically 8 times, since there are 8 pairs in the list). Therefore, there are no conditions related to the loop's execution based on the contents of the queue or the variables `x` and `y` directly.
3. The states `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, and `A[0][0]` being equal to `cur` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, but they might be relevant for usage of the values within the loop body.

Since there are no conditions preventing the loop from executing, we conclude that the loop will execute as designed.

However, for clarity, we can summarize the values that exist before the loop executes:

- `N` is between 3 and 10, which just indicates the size of some structure (perhaps a grid or matrix) but does not impact the loop execution.
- `queue` not being empty suggests that there might be elements to process, but it does not influence the loop execution.
- `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, which could be important depending on how they are used in the loop body.
- `A[0][0]` being equal to `cur` provides a starting condition, but again does not impact the loop execution.

Thus, there are no adjustments required for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`**
