The code snippet appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. This operation modifies the `queue` variable by adding a new tuple, but does not affect the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[1]`, or `parent[1]`. The state of these variables remains unchanged as the operation only impacts the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[1]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)`, and `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
