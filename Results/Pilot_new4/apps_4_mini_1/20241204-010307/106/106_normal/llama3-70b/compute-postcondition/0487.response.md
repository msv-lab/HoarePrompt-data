The code appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are being added to the `queue`, but no other variables are modified as a result of this operation. Therefore, the outputs of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 2; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`; `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`.**
