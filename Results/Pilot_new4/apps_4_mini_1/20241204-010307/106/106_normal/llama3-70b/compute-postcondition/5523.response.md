The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are currently 0, so `nx` will be equal to `dx` and `ny` will be equal to `dy`. The other variables do not change.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.**
