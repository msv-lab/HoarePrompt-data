Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
