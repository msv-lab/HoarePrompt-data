According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`. Each iteration will take one of these tuples and execute the loop body. The loop will execute a total of 4 times, once for each tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and the loop has likely completed its iteration for the first tuple (either `(-1, 0)` or `(1, 0)`). The value of `dx` and `dy` will be set to the next tuple in the list for the next iteration. 

To determine the states for the next iteration:
- The next tuple will be the second one in the list, which is `(1, 0)`. 
- Therefore, we need to adjust `dx` and `dy` accordingly.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0**
