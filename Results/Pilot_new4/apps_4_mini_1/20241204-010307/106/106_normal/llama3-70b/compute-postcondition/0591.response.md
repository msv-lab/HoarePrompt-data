The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. Since `nx` and `ny` are guaranteed to be within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `ncur` will be valid as it is taken from the 2D array `A` which is indexed by `nx` and `ny`.

The output state reflects the assignment of `ncur` and maintains all the information about the other variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1]` tracks the previous position, `queue` must contain at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
