The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. Therefore, the state of `queue` changes to include this new tuple, while all other variable values remain the same. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the contents of `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
