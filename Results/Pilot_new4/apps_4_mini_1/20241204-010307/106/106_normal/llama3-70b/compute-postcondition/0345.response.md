To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state and how the loop operates. 

The loop iterates over the list of directions `[(dx, dy), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. In each iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will take on each of these pairs sequentially.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 0
- The next values of `dx` and `dy` will be taken from the list, moving to the next pair (1, 0).

Thus, for the next iteration:
- `dx` will change to 1
- `dy` will remain 0

The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop's iteration through the list of directions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`.**
