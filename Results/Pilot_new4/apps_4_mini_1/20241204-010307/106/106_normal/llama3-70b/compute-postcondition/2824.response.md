Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, and `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors. Otherwise, the execution does not update `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, or `queue`.***
