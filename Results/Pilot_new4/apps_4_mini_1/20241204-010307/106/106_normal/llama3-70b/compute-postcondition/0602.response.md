The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged, but it's important to note that `ncur` is dependent on the values of `nx`, `ny`, and `A[nx][ny]`, which were updated previously. 

Since `dist[2][ncur]` was updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the state of `dist[2][cur]` is also relevant. However, we don't have specific values for these variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`**.
