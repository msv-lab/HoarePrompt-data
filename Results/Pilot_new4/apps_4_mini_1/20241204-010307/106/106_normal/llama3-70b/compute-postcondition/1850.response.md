The code updates the distance for the reachable cell `ncur` in the `dist` array. The new distance for `ncur` is calculated as the distance to reach the current cell `cur` plus 1. Here, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Since `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells, the state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current value of `piece` is 0, and the distance to reach `ncur` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
