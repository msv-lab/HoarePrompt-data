The statement assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values for `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged because the `parent` array is being updated, and there is no indication that `cur` or `piece` are altered in the provided code. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `cur` and `piece` can take on any values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][dy]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][dy]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
