Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `dist[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, `parent[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, and `queue` contains tuples of valid moves (if any valid moves resulted in updates). If no valid moves were found, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
