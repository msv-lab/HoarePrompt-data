The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables include `ncur`, which is equal to `A[x + 1][N + 1]`. The variable `queue` will now contain an additional tuple.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and we have updated the `queue` with the new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][N + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
