The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]` variable. The previous state of `ncur` is determined by `nx` and `ny`, which are derived from `x` and constants. The other variable states remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1` and is greater than the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`**.
