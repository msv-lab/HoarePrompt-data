Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
