Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
