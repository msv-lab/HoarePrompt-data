Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` is equal to 1, `y` is equal to 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
