The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is between 1 and 9; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
