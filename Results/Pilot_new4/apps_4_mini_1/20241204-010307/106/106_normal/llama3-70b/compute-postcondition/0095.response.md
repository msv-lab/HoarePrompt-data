Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 2, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` along with all previously existing elements. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized states.***
