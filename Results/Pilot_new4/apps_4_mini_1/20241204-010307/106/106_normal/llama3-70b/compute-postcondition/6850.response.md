The statement `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value at the position `[nx][ny]` of the array `A` to the variable `ncur`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is `0 + dy`. Given that `x` is between `2` and `N-1`, and `N` is between `3` and `10`, this means `nx` will be between `2 + dx` and `N - 1 + dx`. Here, `dy` will affect `ny` but remains undefined. 

As a result, the value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`, where `nx` varies based on `x` and `dx`, and `ny` varies based on `dy`.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
