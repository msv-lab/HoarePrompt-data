The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current values of `dist[0][cur]` and adds 1 to it. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before this assignment, after executing this line, the condition `dist[0][ncur]` will no longer hold true because it will equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, and we need to maintain the conditions of the remaining variables which are still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than).**
