The code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, but we know that `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
