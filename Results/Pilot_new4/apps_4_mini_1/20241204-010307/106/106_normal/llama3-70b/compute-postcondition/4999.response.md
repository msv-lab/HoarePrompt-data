Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `nx` is `3 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions, `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains all valid tuples, `A` is defined such that `0 <= x + dx < N` and `0 <= y + dy < M for all (dx, dy). The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` respectively.***
