The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. The variable `cur` remains unchanged, while `ncur` is already assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which is dependent on the values of `x` and `y`. The updated value of `dist[1][ncur]` can be calculated based on the current values of `dist[1][cur]` and `ncur`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[0][ncur]` continues to represent the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`; `parent[0][ncur]` holds updated parent positions; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
