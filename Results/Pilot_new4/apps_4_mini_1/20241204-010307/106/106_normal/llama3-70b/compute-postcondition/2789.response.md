The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` as a tuple to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are unknown, but `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, which indicates that it is determined by the array `A` at the new y-coordinate (`y + 1`). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece)**.
