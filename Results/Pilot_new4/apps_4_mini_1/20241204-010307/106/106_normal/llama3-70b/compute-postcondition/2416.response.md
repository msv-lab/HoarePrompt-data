The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The variables involved in this operation are `ncur` and the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][-1]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `piece` are not affected by this operation. 

The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, and it will remain unchanged in the output state. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and we have added `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`.**
