Postcondition: ***`piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (i.e., 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
