Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains at least one valid position and the newly appended position `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
