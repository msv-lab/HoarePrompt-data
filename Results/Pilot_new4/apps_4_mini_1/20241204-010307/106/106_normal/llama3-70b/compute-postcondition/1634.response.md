The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The variables `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not directly modified by this operation. Therefore, we need to retain their previous values.

Since `ncur` is based on the value of `A[nx][ny]`, it is still valid after the code execution. The tuple containing `ncur` and `1` is now included in `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece); `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
