Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is `A[0][2]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`, while `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur to the variables.***
