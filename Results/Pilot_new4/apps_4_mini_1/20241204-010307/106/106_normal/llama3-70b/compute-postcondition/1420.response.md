The statement assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, and thus, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated with those values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
