Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N); `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `piece` is equal to 2 and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
