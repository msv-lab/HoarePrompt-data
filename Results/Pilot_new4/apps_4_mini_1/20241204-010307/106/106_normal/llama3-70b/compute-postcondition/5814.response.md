Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access, and the current value of `piece` is 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
