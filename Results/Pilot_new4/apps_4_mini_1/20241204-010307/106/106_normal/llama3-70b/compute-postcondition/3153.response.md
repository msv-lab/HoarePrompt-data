Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` iterates from 0 to `N-1`, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions based on the updates made during the loop, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position as updated, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If `A[x][y]` has been equal to `cur` during any iteration, `dist` and `parent` will be updated for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs based on the corresponding `piece`. If no updates were made, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged from their values at the start of the loop.**
