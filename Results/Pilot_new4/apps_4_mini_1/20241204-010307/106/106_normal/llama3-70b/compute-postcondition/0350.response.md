The `queue` variable is updated to append a new tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, this influences the calculation of `ncur`. The initial conditions are maintained as specified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
