In the given code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are both -1, which means they will decrease the values of `x` and `y` by 1. 

Since the initial conditions state that `N` is at least 5, we can infer that `x` and `y` must be defined in the context of `N`, although their specific values are not provided. However, we know that after executing the code:

- The value of `nx` will be `x - 1`.
- The value of `ny` will be `y - 1`.

The other variables (`N`, `dx`, and `dy`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`**.
