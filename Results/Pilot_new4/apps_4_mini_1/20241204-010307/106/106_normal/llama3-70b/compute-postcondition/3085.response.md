Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `ny` is 3; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
