The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` (which is a constant) are the only variables being impacted. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`; 0 <= `nx` < `N`; 0 <= `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to (cur, 1); `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
