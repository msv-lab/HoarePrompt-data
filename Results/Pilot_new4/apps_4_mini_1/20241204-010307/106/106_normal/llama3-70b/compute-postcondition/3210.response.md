The `queue` variable is updated by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly in this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
