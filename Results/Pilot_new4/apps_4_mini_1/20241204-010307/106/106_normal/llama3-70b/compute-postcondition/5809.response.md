Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` where valid `ncur` corresponds to positions that satisfy the conditions, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` based on the distance from `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, and `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples.**
