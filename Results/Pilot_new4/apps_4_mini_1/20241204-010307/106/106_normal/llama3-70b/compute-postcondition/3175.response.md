The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variable `queue` is affected by this operation, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
