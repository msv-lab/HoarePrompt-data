The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[0][cur]` incremented by 1 to `dist[0][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are not modified; only the element `dist[0][ncur]` is affected.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, we know that `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated based on the previous value found in `dist[0][cur]`. The values of `dist[0][cur]` and `ncur` depend on the previously defined states but do not alter the constraints on `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
