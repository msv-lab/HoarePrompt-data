Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the updated parent tuples with `parent[1][ncur]` now being `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` equals `dist[1][cur] + 1` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is satisfied.***
