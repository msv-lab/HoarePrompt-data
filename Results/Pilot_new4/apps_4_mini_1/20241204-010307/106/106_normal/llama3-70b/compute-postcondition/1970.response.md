The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which means it will reflect the element in the 2D array `A` at the coordinates determined by `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes all the previous information along with the newly assigned value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
