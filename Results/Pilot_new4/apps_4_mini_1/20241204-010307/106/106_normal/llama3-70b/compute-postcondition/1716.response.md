The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1, `nx` will be `x - 1`. Since `dy` is 1, `ny` will be `y + 1`. The value of `y` is currently 1, so `ny` will be `2`. The initial conditions for `N` and `x` are still valid after the code is executed.

The updated values are:
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to `2`

The output state will reflect these changes while keeping the original ranges and conditions intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2**
