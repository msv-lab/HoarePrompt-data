After evaluating the provided code snippet, we note the following:

1. The line `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at index `[2][ncur]`. 
2. The value being assigned is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, but the values of `cur` and `dist[2][cur]` were not specified in the initial state.
3. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Thus, while we do not know the exact values of `cur` or `dist[2][cur]`, we can state that `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on that value.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 0 and N-1; `dist` is updated such that `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects valid parent tuples; `queue` contains valid tuples; `piece` is greater than 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`.**
