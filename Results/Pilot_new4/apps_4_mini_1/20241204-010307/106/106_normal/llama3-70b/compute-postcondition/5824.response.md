The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are involved in this assignment, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The values for `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, so we only update the relevant variable. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
