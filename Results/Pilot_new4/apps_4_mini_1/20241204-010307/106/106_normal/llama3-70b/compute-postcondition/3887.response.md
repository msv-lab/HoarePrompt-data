The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, which is based on the values of `nx` and `ny` that are calculated as `2 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. 

Since `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it implies that the condition for updating the `parent` array has been satisfied. 

The states of the other variables, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `queue`, remain unchanged as they are not affected directly by the assignment operation. 

Thus, the output state reflecting the changes is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
