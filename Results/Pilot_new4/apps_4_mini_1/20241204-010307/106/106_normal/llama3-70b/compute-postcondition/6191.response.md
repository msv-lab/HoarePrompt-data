The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The variable `ncur` holds the value `A[x - 1][1]`, while the second element of the tuple is simply `2`. Consequently, while the variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and their previous states are not altered, the `queue` now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][1]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2), `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
