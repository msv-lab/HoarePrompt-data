The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is -2, `nx` will be equal to `x - 2`. The value of `ny` is `y + dy`, and since `dy` is -1, `ny` will be equal to `y - 1`. Given that `y` is equal to `N`, we can express `ny` as `N - 1`. 

The variables that change are `nx` and `ny`, while `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. We also note that `N` is between 3 and 10, so `y` is also between 3 and 10.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `N - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `N - 1`.**
