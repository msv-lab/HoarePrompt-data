The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the original values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Since `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -1, this results in `nx` being equal to `x - 1` and `ny` being equal to `8`. 

The initial conditions indicate that `y` is 9, so after the execution of the code:
- `nx` is updated to `x - 1`
- `ny` is updated to `8`

The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition about `ncur` is not executed since we only update `nx` and `ny` values in this snippet.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8**
