The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and also assigns the value of `piece` to the same index. The specific value of `ncur` is derived from the matrix `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The variables `cur` and `piece` have specific values, and we can infer that `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the corresponding values. The previous states of the affected variables do not change except for `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`.**
