The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `4 + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively, which are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N` (where `N` is between 4 and 10). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, `queue` contains valid tuples for the current position and piece, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.**
