The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The right side of the equation is `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `cur` appears to be a previously defined variable not present in the initial state, but it can be assumed as a valid index given the context of the program. The value of `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx = x - 2` and `ny = y - 1`. 

Since `ncur` is determined by accessing an element from the array `A` at indices `nx` and `ny`, which depend on the values of `x` and `y`. 

The state of the other variables, including `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`, is not affected directly. Therefore, only `dist[0][ncur]` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer that is less than `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
