The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are unknown based on the provided initial state. The other variables remain unchanged, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` remains unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
