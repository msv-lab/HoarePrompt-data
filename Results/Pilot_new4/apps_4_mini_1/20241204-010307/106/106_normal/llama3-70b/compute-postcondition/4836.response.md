The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values of `parent[0][ncur]`. The initial state includes `N` being between 3 and 10, which does not change, but the `parent` array's state updates accordingly. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, so they remain unknown, but they are assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
