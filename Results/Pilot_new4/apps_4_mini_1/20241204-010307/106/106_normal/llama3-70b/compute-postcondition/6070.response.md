Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, and `queue` contains all positions reachable from `cur` based on the conditions stated. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged and `queue` is empty.**
