The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `x` and `y + 1`, respectively. The states of the other variables (`dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `piece`, `cur`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x][y + 1]`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x][y + 1]`.**
