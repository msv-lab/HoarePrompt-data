The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are both 2, so we need to consider the values of `dx` and `dy` in order to determine `nx` and `ny`. However, since `dx` and `dy` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine specific numerical values for `nx` and `ny` without making assumptions about them.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the original values of `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code affects only `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent` reflects updated parent references for valid moves, `queue` must contain at least one valid position, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`.**
