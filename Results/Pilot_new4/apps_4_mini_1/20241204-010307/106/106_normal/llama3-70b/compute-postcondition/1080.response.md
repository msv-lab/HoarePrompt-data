The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Here, `ncur` represents an index to access an element in the matrix `dist`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. However, we need to know the value of `cur` to determine the specific change in `dist[0][ncur]`. Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we only indicate that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the current value of `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
