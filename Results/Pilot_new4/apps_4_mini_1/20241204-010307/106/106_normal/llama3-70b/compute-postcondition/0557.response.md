The variable `queue` is modified by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `0`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are directly used in the append operation. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is `x - 2`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is `x - 2`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
