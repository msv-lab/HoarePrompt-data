Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[0][1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, no changes are made to the variables.***
