Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples and includes `(ncur, 0)`, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, if the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true, then an error occurs as `A[0][-1]` is out of bounds, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` if `piece` is 0; if these conditions do not hold, no updates occur in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
