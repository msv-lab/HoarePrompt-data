According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the iterator that goes through the list of tuples representing the possible moves: `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will iterate over these four tuples regardless of the state of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't determine any state modifications that need to occur within the loop itself. However, we can confirm that the loop will execute as long as the list of tuples is defined, which it is in this case.

Thus, no adjustments need to be made to the existing states `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` for the loop to execute, as it will run for the defined set of tuples.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains parent references for valid paths, `queue` contains tuples of valid reachable cells from `(x, y)`**
