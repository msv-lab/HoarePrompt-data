Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate. If the coordinates `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then the `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state.***
