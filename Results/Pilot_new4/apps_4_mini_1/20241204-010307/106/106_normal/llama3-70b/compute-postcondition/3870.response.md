Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
