The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the value `2` to the `queue`. The other variables' values remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the current values of those variables, along with the change made by the code.

The output state remains valid for the unchanged variables, and we include the description of the new state of the `queue` variable after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece); `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
