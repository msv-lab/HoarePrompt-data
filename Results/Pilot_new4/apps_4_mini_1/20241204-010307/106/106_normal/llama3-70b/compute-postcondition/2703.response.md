The code updates the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]`, assigning it the value `(cur, piece)`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][-1]`, `dist`, `parent` for other indices, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `cur, piece`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `dx` and `dy` must be prepared for the next iteration, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
