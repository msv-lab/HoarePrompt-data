The `queue` variable is modified by appending a tuple `(ncur, 0)`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged, while the `queue` variable is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
