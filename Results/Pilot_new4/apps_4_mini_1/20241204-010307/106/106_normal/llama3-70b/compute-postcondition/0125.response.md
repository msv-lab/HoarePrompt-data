To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions and variable states provided before the loop starts.

1. The loop iterates over the pairs of `dx` and `dy`, which are defined in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This means that for each iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on one of these four pairs.

2. The variables `nx` and `ny` must be calculated and must lie between 0 and N (exclusive) for at least some iterations. We know from the problem statement that:
   - `ny` equals `N`
   - `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for all `dx` values in the loop.

3. The valid ranges for `dx` based on the pairs are:
   - If `dx = -1`, `nx` will be `x - 1`.
   - If `dx = 1`, `nx` will be `x + 1`.

4. To ensure that `nx` falls within the valid range (0 < nx < N), we need to ensure:
   - For `dx = -1`: `x - 1 > 0` implies `x > 1`.
   - For `dx = 1`: `x + 1 < N` implies `x < N - 1`.

5. Similarly for `dy` values:
   - Since `ny` is equal to `N`, we must check the valid range for `dy` affecting `ny`:
   - If `dy = -1`, `ny` would be `N - 1`, which is valid as it is greater than 0.
   - If `dy = 1`, `ny` would be `N + 1`, which is not valid since we need `ny` < N.

6. The conditions for the loop execution can be summarized as:
   - The value of `x` must be such that `1 < x < N - 1` to ensure that both `nx` can be valid for all the `dx` values.
   - The value of `N` must remain within the specified range of `3 <= N <= 10`.

7. Additionally, for the loop to consider any changes to `dist`, `piece` should equal `0`, and some valid `ncur` must exist that satisfies the condition:
   - `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` for any valid `ncur`, otherwise, the states will remain unchanged.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop is as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` must be greater than 1 and less than N - 1, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` must be greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`**
