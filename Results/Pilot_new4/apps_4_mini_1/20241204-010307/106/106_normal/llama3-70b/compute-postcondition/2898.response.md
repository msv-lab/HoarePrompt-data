Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, `x` is `N`, `nx` is equal to `N + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, meaning `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1 for all (dx, dy).***
