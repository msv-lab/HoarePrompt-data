Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
