The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state or the code, so we can't determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `x + dx` (value depends on `dx`); `ny` is `y + dy` (value depends on `dy`).

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`.**
