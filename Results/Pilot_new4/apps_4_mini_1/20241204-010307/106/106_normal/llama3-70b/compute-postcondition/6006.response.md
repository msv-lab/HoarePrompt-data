Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 8, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][8]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
