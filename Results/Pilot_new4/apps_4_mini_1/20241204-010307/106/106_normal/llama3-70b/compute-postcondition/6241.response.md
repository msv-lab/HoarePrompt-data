Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
