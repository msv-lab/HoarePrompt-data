Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)` and `queue` is updated to include the valid moves processed during the loop along with the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, maintaining the current value of `A[1][0]` equal to `cur`, while `dx` and `dy` are set for 8 iterations; `nx` is calculated as `1 + dx[i]` and `ny` as `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`, with `ncur` being equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
