Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the valid range (0 to N-1), then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
