According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 3 and 10, and `y` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than `y`, which in this case means `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2**
