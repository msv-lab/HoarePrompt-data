According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes in the variables `dx` and `dy`. The loop is designed to execute a fixed number of times, specifically 4 times, corresponding to the 4 tuples in the list `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `piece` is 0. Given the loop will execute once for each tuple, after the last iteration (the 4th one), the loop will not execute again, as it will have completed all iterations.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count (which implicitly is 4 when the last execution occurs) needs to be reset, but since this loop doesn't have a variable that tracks the iteration count, it cannot execute again without re-invoking the loop context. 

Therefore, the state remains unchanged, and no further adjustments to the variables are needed because the loop has exhausted all its iterations.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 0**
