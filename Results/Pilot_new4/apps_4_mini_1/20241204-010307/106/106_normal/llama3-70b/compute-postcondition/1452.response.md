The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which is `2 + (-1) = 1`. The value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which is `1 + (-1) = 0`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to 1 and `ny` remains 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1**
