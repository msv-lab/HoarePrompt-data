Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist[2]` captures the minimum distances from the start position to reachable positions according to the movement rules, `parent[2]` reflects the tracking of the paths taken to reach those positions, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` pairs generated during the iterations. If the loop does not execute, then `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `queue` would be empty. If the loop executes, `dist[2][ncur]` will contain the updated distances based on the conditions met during the iterations, `parent[2][ncur]` will reflect the paths taken to those positions, and `queue` will contain all valid pairs based on successful updates. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
