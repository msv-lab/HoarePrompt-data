The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 2. The values of `nx` and `ny` do not change, and the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unaffected. However, the value of `ncur` is now dependent on the specific element in the array `A` at the position `(-1, 2)`. 

Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, we still hold the constraints on `N` after execution. However, the exact value of `A[nx][ny]` cannot be determined without knowing the structure of array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`**.
