Given the initial state where `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` and `ny` are undefined, and `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, we can analyze the impact of the code:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

To execute this code, we need values for `dx` and `dy`. Since they are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

- `nx` will be `0 + dx`
- `ny` will be `2 + dy`

Thus, the values of `nx` and `ny` are defined based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`:

- `nx` is equal to `dx`
- `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`

The states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
