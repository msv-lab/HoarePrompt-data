The code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be one more than the current distance value `dist[0][cur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this specific line of code. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, we note that `dist[0][ncur]` will be strictly greater than its previous value. 

The preconditions that are still valid are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple
- `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- The value of `piece` is 0
- The distance `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
