Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1 - 1`, and `ny` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
