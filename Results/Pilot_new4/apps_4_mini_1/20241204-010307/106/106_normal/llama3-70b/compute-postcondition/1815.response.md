`dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The current state indicates that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` must have been greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` before this assignment, and now it will equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is either 0 or 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[2][cur]` is less than the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]`.**
