Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and pairs `(nx, ny)` are valid indices within the range [0, 5]. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the valid range, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, no updates or assignments are made.***
