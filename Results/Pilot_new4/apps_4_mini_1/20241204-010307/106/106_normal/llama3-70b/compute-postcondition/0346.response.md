The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, we have:

- `nx` becomes `x + 1` (which is updated)
- `ny` becomes `0` (which is already defined)

The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, and the condition for `ncur` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0.**
