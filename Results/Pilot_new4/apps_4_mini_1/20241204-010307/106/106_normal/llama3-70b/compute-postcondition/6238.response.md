The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, and while `cur` is referenced, its value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can't provide a specific value for `parent[0][ncur]`, but it does get updated. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
