Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `queue` contains one element `[(cur, i)]` if `A[x][y]` equals `cur` and `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
