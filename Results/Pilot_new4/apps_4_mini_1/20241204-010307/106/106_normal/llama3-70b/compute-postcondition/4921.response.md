The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated based on the current distance at `cur` incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `parent[0][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, while `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to reflect the new distance.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is still 0 if not modified, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` and `queue` might be modified based on the next values of `nx` and `ny`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
