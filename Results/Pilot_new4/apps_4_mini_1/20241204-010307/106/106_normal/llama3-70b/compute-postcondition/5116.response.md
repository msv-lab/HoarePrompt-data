The code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. This indicates that for the value of `ncur`, the parent is now `cur` and the associated piece is `piece`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the updated parent tuples with `parent[1][ncur]` now being `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
