Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position, `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
