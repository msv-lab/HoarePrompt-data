According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple that was processed. Since there are a total of 4 tuples, if the current iteration processed the last tuple `(0, 1)`, then in the next iteration, it will process the first tuple again, which is `(-1, 0)`.

Assuming the last processed tuple was `(dx, dy) = (0, 1)`, the next iteration will start with `dx` set to `-1` and `dy` set to `0`.

Since there are no changes made to `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` based on the current iteration's context, they remain unchanged.

Thus, to summarize, at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1 + 0`, and the loop will use the next direction changes.**
