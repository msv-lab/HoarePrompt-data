In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the existing values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The previous value of `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is currently `y + 1`. After executing the code, `nx` will now hold the value `x + dx` and `ny` will hold the value `y + dy`. 

Assuming that `dx` and `dy` are defined elsewhere and hold some specific integer values, the updated values of `nx` and `ny` will directly reflect this computation. However, since the actual values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, the Output State will include the unchanged variables and the expressions for the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
