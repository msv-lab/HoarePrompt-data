Postcondition: ***If the loop executed, `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of those positions, and `queue` contains tuples for the newly reachable positions; otherwise, `piece` is 1, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is unchanged. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
