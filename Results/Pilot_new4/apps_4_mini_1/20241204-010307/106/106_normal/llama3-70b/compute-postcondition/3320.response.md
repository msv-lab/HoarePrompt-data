Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
