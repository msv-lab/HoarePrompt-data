The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this code snippet. The previous value of `ncur` is known to be equal to `A[1][1]`, but its specific value is not given. Therefore, the output reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`, while all other variables maintain their initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
