The `queue` variable is modified by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to it. The values of `ncur` and `0` are used directly for this operation while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
