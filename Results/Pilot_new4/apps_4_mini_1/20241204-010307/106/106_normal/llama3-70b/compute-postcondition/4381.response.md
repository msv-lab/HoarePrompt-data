Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
