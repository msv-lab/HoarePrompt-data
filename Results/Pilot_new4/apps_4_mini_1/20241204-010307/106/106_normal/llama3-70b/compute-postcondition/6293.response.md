The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This means that the variable `queue` is modified to include the new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` is updated to include the element `(ncur, 2)`**.
