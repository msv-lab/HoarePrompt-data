The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added as an element in the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values along with the new entry in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N - 2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N - 2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
