Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is A[nx][ny`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the value `(ncur, 0)`.***
