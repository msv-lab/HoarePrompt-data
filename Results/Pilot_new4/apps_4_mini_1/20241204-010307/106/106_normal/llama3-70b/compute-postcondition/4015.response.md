The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` now contains the additional position `(ncur, 2)`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` now contains the additional position `(ncur, 2)`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur, piece`.**
