The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state provided, but `ncur` is defined as equal to `A[1][3]`. Since we do not have information on `cur` and `piece`, we cannot determine their values. However, the existing variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
