The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous state indicates that `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The state of the other variables, including `cur`, remains unchanged, but the distance for the new index `ncur` is updated based on the distance of the current index `cur`. 

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`**.
