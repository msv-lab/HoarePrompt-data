Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
