The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the existing `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are still valid and reflect the conditions prior to the append operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` has been updated to `x + dx`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`; `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to its previous contents; distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; tuples for (dx, dy) are valid for execution; piece equals `1`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur, piece`.**
