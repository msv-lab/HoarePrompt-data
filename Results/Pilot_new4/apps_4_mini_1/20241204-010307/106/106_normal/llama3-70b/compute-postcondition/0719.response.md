The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The preconditions indicate that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is `x - 2`. The values of `dist[0][cur]`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` depend on the current state of the `dist` array, which is not provided. 

However, we know that the update occurs based on the previous value of `dist[0][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
