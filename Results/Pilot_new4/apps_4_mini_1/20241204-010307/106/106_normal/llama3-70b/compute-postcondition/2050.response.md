The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value of `piece` is unchanged at 2, while `cur` is previously defined but its specific value is unknown in this state. The `parent` variable is being updated for the index `[1][ncur]` with the `cur` value and the current `piece` value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, `dx` and `dy` take on values from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], `nx` is `x + dx` for each `dx` value, and `ny` is `y + dy` for each `dy` value, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, current value of `piece` is 1, and now `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
