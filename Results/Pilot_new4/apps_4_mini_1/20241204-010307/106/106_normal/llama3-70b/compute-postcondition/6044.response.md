To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state and the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples defining directional changes: `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. This means that each iteration will assign `dx` and `dy` with the respective values from the tuples.

2. The current state mentions that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, and the value at `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. The loop should execute regardless of these specific values since they don't directly affect the iteration over the list of tuples.

3. However, to ensure that the loop operates correctly, we need to consider whether the variables and their ranges are valid within the context of the loop. Since this is not directly specified in the state, we need to ensure that:
   - The values of `dx` and `dy` do not attempt to access out-of-bounds indices in the array `A`. This will depend on the context and the current indices `x` and `y`.
   - Specifically, since `y` is 0, we should ensure that `x + dx` and `y + dy` stay within valid bounds of the matrix `A`. 

Thus, the loop can execute as long as the indices derived from `x` and `y` with `dx` and `dy` do not exceed the size of the matrix. 

In summary, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` must be within the bounds of A, `y + dy` must also be within the bounds of A, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`**
