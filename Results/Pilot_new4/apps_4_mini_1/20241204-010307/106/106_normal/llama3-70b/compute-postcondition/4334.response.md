The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent` array at the indices `1` and `ncur`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but `piece` is equal to 1, and `cur` remains unchanged. The other variables and their states are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 1)`; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions; `piece` is equal to 1; current direction being processed is `(-1, 1)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
