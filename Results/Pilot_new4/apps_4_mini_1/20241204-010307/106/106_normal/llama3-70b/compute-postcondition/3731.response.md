In the provided code snippet, `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` attempts to assign a value to `parent[1][ncur]`. However, since `ncur` is invalid (specifically `ny` is -1, which is outside the valid index range), this assignment does not take effect. No changes occur to the state of the program due to this invalid assignment, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1 (invalid), and the attempted assignment of `parent[1][ncur]` is not performed.**
