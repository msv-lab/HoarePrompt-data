According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pairs of direction values `(dx, dy)` that are being iterated over in the loop. The loop is set to iterate over four pairs: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. 

Before the loop starts, the relevant variables are `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, and `ny`. The variables `nx` and `ny` should be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly, as they are expected to take on values based on the direction pairs `(dx, dy)` and the current cell `(x, y)`. 

Since the loop is designed to process directional changes from the current position `(x, y)`, `nx` and `ny` should be calculated within the loop based on the current values of `dx` and `dy`. 

To ensure the loop runs correctly, we need to ensure that `nx` and `ny` are set to their respective values derived from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` contains the distance values for reachable cells, `parent[0]` indicates the parents of these cells if reachable, `queue` contains tuples of reachable cells and their associated pieces, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1` (for the first iteration with dx = -1, dy = -1)**
