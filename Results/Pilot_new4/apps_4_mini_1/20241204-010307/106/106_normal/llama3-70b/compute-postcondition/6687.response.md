The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` is not specified, but we know that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment occurs. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the distance from `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
