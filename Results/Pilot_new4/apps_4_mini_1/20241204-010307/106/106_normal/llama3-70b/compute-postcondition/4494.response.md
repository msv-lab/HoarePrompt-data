Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 0, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples; if all moves are invalid, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.**
