The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][N]`, but we do not know the exact values of `A`, `cur`, or `dist`. Therefore, we can only express the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` in terms of `cur`.

The states of the other variables besides `dist` are not affected. Thus, the Output State retains the information about `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`, while updating the state of `dist`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][N]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
