According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction vectors `[(dx, dy)]`. The loop will execute for each combination of `dx` and `dy` provided in this list. Since there are four pairs in the list, the loop will execute a total of four times.

At the end of the last iteration, the code would have completed one iteration over a direction vector. We need to determine the current state of the loop variable pair `(dx, dy)` to identify what the next values will be.

Given that the loop has not been executed yet, we can conclude that the first iteration will use the first directional pair. After each iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take the next set of values from the list.

If the loop was currently on the first iteration, the direction would have been `(-1, -1)`. For the loop to execute again, it will move to the next direction vector, which is `(-1, 1)`.

Thus, after the last iteration, we should adjust our state to reflect the next pair of direction vectors.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**.
