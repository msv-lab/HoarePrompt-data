The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array `A` and that `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` will take the value from the location in the array determined by `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` is within the range of 0 to N, and `ny` is within the range of 0 to N; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
