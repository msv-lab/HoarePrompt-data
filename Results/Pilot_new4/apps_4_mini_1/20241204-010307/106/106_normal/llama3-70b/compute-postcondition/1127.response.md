The code assigns values to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[2][0]`, but the specific value of `cur` is unknown. Thus, the state of the `parent` variable is updated, while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we know that `parent[2][ncur]` will hold a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The previous states of the other variables do not change.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated by adding 1 to `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
