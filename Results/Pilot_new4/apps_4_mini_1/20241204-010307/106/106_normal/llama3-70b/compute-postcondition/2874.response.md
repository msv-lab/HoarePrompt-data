The code updates a specific element in the `dist` array. The value at `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the result of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The state of the variables `N`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now one greater than its previous value `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
