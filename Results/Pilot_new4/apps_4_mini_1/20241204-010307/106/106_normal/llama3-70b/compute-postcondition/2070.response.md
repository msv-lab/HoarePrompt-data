Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices based on the conditions met during the iterations, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, and `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, which include all valid `(ncur, 1)` entries for reachable indices. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
