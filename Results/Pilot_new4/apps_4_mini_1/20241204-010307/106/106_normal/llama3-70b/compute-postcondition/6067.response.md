The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The precondition values for `ncur` and `queue` remain valid, but the `queue` variable is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
