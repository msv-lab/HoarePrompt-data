The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1, the value of `nx` becomes `x - 1`. The value of `ny` remains the same as `y` since `dy` is 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Given that `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` and `y` are both between 0 and N-1, and `dx` and `dy` have specific values, we can conclude:

- `nx` will be `x - 1`, which is valid as long as `x` is greater than 0 (since `x` is between 0 and N-1).
- `ny` will simply equal `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`.**
