The code assigns the current position `cur` and the `piece` value (which is 2) to the `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `parent`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value for `parent[2][ncur]`, while retaining the existing information for the other variables.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` contains at least 1 reachable position, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
