Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 3; `ny` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[3][0]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and an entry `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
