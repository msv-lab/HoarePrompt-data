Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` contains all updated positions plus the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
