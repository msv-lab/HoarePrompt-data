The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1, `nx` will be `x - 1`. Since `dy` is 1, `ny` will be `y + 1`, which results in `ny` being `2`. The conditions specify that `x` must be between `0` and `N - 1`, which ensures that `nx` will remain within valid bounds after decrementing by 1.

Thus, the updated state will indicate that `nx` is `x - 1` (which is valid given `x` is in the range) and `ny` is `2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2.**
