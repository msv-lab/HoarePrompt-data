In the provided code snippet, the operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple consisting of the current value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue` list. The values of `ncur` and `queue` will be affected by this operation, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 9.
- `y` is 9.
- `dx` is the current first element of the tuple.
- `dy` is the current second element of the tuple.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- `piece` is equal to 0.
- The distance from the start to `ncur` is equal to the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1.
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.
- `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.

Since `queue` is not defined in the initial conditions, we can assume it is an empty list prior to the append operation.

After executing the code, the `queue` will now contain one entry, which is the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated `queue` and maintains all the other variables intact. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, the distance from the start to `ncur` is equal to the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` is equal to `[(ncur, 0)]`.**
