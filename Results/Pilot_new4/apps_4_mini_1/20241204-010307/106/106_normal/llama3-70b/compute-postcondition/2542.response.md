The `queue` list is updated by appending a tuple consisting of the values `(cur, i)`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, and only the `queue` variable is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer; `dist` contains the updated shortest distances for valid indices based on the conditions; `parent` contains the updated parent indices for valid nodes; `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(cur, i)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer; `dist` contains the updated shortest distances for valid indices based on the conditions; `parent` contains the updated parent indices for valid nodes; `queue` contains tuples of valid states for indices where the conditions were met along with the newly added tuple `(cur, i)`**.
