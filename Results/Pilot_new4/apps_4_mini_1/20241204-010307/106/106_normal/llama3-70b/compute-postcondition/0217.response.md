The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` have specific values, and since they were not altered in the code, the values of `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect these assignments.

The output state remains valid for all other variables, including the states of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and any other related variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `x` is a valid integer within bounds; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
