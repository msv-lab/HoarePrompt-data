To analyze the code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` given the initial state, we must consider the following:

- The initial state provides constraints on `N`, `y`, and `x`. 
- `dx` and `dy` are the components of the tuple that will be used to update `nx` and `ny`.
- The values of `piece` and `dist` remain unchanged.

The new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Since we do not know the exact values of `dx` and `dy`, we cannot calculate the exact new values for `nx` and `ny`, but we can express them in terms of the current variables and the updates from the tuple.

Therefore, the impact of the code will be to update `nx` to `x + dx` and `ny` to `y + dy`, without changing other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `piece` and `dist` remain unchanged.**
