Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is in a state that allows updates based on valid moves, `parent[0]` is in a state that reflects potential connections, `queue` contains tuples of nodes that will be manipulated according to the loop's execution, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = 2 + dy`, and it is true that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
