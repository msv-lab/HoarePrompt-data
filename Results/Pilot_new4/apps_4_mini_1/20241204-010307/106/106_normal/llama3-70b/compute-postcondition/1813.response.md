The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the expressions given for them and are known to be within the ranges specified (between 0 and N, exclusive). Therefore, `ncur` will take on a value that is determined by the contents of the array `A` at the positions defined by `nx` and `ny`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions while updating `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is either 0 or 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
