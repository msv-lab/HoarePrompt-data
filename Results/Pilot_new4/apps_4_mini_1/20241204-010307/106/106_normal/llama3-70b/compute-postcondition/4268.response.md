Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is `N - 1`; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`; `dist[1]` remains unchanged; `parent[1]` remains unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, piece); `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.**
