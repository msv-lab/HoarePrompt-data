`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is 0 and `ny` is -1. Since the value of `ny` is -1, it is likely that `A[0][-1]` is out of bounds for the array `A`, assuming `A` is a two-dimensional list. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to the index being out of bounds.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions, `queue` contains all reachable tuples, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, and an error occurs as `A[0][-1]` is out of bounds.**
