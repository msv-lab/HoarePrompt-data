Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
