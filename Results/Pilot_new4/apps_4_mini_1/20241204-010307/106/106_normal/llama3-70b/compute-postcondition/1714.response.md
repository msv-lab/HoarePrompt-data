Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 0, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions take place.***
