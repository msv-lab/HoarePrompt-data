The code updates the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. First, we examine the existing variables:

- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `y` is 0.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is 1.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

The line `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is the current value of `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, as they are not being modified by this line of code.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
