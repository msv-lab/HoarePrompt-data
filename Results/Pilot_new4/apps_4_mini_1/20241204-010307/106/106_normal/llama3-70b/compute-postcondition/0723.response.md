Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur in the variables. There is no else part in the code.***
