The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is previously defined as equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is defined as `x - 2`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the value of `A[x - 2][3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the addition of the tuple to `queue`, while retaining the preconditions. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
