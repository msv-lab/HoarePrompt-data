The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur` updates the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]` with the value of `cur`. The variable `piece` remains unchanged at its value of 2. The states of the other variables, such as `N`, `dist`, `queue`, and `ncur`, are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist` is updated as `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` retains its current entries; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
