The code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][-3]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `y` is -1. Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, it implies that `x` can take on some values within that range, affecting `nx`. 

The variable `cur` remains unchanged, but now we can define `ncur` as being dependent on the values of `A` and the modified index `nx`. The exact value of `dist[0][ncur]` will depend on the value of `dist[0][cur]`, which is incremented by 1.

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is now assigned a new value based on the previous state of `dist[0][cur]`, we can generalize that `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-3]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
