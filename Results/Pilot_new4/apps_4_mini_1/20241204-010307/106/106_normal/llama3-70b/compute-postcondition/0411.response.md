Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 1 with `dist[1][ncur]` greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to the variables.***
