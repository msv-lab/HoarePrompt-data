Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
