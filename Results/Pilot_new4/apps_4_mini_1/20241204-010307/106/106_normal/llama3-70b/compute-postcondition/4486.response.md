To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the `dx` and `dy` values.

The loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples `[(dx, dy), ...]`, and on each iteration, it assigns the next tuple to `dx` and `dy` respectively.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the tuple `(-2, 1)`.
- The loop will take the next tuple in the list for the next iteration.

The next tuple in the list after `(-2, 1)` is `(-1, -2)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `dx` will be updated to -1.
- `dy` will be updated to -2.

The rest of the state remains unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1**
