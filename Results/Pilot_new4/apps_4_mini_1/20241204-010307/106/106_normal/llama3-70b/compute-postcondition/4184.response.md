The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `0 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. Since the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, `nx` and `ny` are represented as `dx` and `2 + dy`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state includes the unchanged variables and the newly assigned value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[dx][2 + dy]`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
