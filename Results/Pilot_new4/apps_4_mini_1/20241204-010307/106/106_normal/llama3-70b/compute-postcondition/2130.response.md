Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, there are no changes made.***
