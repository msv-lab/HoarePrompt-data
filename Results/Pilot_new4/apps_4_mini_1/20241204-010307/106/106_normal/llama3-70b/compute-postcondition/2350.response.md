To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

The loop iterates over a set of directional changes represented by the pairs `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`, which correspond to moving in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances for the current position.
- `parent[1]` contains the parent positions for the current position.
- The variables `piece`, `ncur`, and `cur` are also utilized in the logic of the loop.

1. The loop is indexed by `(dx, dy)`, meaning it will iterate over four directional tuples.
2. The loop will execute one more time unless it has already processed all tuples in the list.
3. Since the loop doesnâ€™t modify the list of tuples to iterate over, it will simply proceed to the next tuple in the next iteration.

Since there are four tuples and it is not mentioned that we are at the last tuple, we infer that at the end of the last iteration, we are currently processing the first three tuples, which means at the start of the loop for the next iteration, we will be processing the fourth tuple.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we can assume:
- The current tuple being processed must be the last one, `(0, 1)`, after processing all previous tuples.
  
State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is the current position, `ncur` is the next position being considered, and now the loop will iterate with `dx` as 0 and `dy` as 1.**
