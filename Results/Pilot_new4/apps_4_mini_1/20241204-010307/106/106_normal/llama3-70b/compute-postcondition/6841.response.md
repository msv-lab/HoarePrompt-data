The statement assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the tuples `(dx, dy)`. The value of `nx` becomes `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The variables `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, and `x` remain unchanged. However, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
