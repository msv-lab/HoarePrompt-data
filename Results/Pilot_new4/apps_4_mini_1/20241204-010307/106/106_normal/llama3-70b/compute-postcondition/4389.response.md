According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of values `(dx, dy)` which represent the possible movements. The loop will execute for each of these pairs. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last pair in the list, which is `(2, 1)`. The loop will continue to execute until all pairs have been iterated over. Since the loop has already gone through the last pair, it cannot execute again because there are no more pairs to iterate over.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, it would need to start over from the first pair, which is `(-2, -1)`. However, since the loop will not execute again without a reset, we note that the states don't actually change for this to occur.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
