In the given code, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`. As `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, its specific value is not provided, but it is assured that `ncur` has been assigned a value based on the values of `nx` and `ny`. 

The variable `dist[0][ncur]` will be changed to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Since `cur` is unchanged, we cannot determine its value, but `dist[0][ncur]` will be incremented by 1 based on the current state of `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is unchanged; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
