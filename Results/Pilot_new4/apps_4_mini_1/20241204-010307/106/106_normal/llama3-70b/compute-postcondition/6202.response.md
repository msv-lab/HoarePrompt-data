According to the code, the for loop iterates over the four directional movements represented by `(dx, dy)`. Since `dx` is currently 1 and `dy` is 0, this represents the movement to the right. As the loop iterates, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the list `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next direction in the list, which is `(0, -1)`. 

The `dx` will change to 0 and `dy` will change to -1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the states need to be updated as follows: 

1. `dx` becomes 0.
2. `dy` becomes -1.

All other states remain the same since they are not directly affected by the for loop's iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1**
