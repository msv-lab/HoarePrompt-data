`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The initial values are `x` is 0, `dx` is 0, `y` is 1, and `dy` is 1. Therefore, `nx` will be 0 + 0 = 0 and `ny` will be 1 + 1 = 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
