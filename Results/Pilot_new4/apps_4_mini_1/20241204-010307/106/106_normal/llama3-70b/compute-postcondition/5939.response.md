Postcondition: ***If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x`; `ny` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`; and `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state of the program.***
