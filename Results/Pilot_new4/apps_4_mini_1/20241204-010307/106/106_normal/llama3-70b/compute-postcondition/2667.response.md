The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variable `dist[1][cur]` has a value that is currently less than `dist[1][ncur]`, and since we know that `dist[1][cur]` is being incremented by 1, the value of `dist[1][ncur]` can now be expressed as a value greater than `dist[1][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][cur]` is less than `dist[1][ncur]`.**
