Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and if `piece` is equal to 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` is set to 2, and `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged.***
