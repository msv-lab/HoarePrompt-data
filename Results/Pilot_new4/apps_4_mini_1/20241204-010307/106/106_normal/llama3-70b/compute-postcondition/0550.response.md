Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the program leaves the state unchanged.***
