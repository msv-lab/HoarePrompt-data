To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which contains 8 pairs of integers representing the changes in coordinates. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` will take on one of these pairs.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `x` and `y` are both 0,
- `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`,
- and the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.

The next iteration will take the next tuple from the list. Given that the list contains 8 tuples, after completing 8 iterations, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the next iteration, we will consider that the current values of `dx` and `dy` will change based on the loop variable. Since this loop is iterating over a fixed set of values, the next iteration will be defined by the next `(dx, dy)` pair.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx'`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy'`, where `(dx', dy')` is the next pair from the list of tuples.**
