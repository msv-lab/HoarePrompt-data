Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, and if `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` assigned the value `(cur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, there are no updates to `dist` or `parent`.***
