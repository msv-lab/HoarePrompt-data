According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `y` compared to `N`. The loop will iterate while `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is at its final value, which is less than `N`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be increased by 1. 

Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, and we want to ensure the loop can execute again, `y` must become `3` or greater, but less than `N`. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate which will be `y + 1`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
