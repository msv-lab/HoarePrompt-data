The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, which takes the current value of `cur` and assigns it along with the value of `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged. We don't know the specific values of `cur`, `ncur`, or the contents of the `parent` array, but we can denote that `parent[2][ncur]` is now set.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1, parent[2][ncur] is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
