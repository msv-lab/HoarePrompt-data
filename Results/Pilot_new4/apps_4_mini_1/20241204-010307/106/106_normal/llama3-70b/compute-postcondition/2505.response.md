According to the code, the loop executes for each pair of `(dx, dy)` in the given list. Since the loop iterates over four pairs, after the last iteration, it has already processed the last pair `(1, 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it would need to start again with the first pair in the list, which is `(-1, -1)`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that the loop has restarted and is ready to process the first pair again. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop iteration itself.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 2.**
