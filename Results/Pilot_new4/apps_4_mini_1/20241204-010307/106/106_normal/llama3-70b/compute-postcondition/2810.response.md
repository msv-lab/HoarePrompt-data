The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, this assignment is valid. The variables `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue`, `x`, `dx`, `dy` are not directly affected by this assignment, so their states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `N` is greater than `y + 1`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
