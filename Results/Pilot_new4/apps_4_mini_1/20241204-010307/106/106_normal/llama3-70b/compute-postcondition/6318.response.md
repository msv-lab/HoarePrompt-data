To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let’s analyze the provided information step by step:

1. The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which contains 8 pairs representing directions.
2. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on each pair from the list in each iteration of the loop.
3. The loop will execute 8 times, once for each pair. If the current iteration index is `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next pair in the list.

We have the following information from the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.
- If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
  
Based on the loop structure and the current iteration:
- The loop has not yet executed for all pairs. If this loop is currently at the last pair of directions, we need to mark the next one to iterate through.

To clarify, since the loop iterates over 8 pairs, if it has executed k iterations, we can determine the next state based on k which ranges from 0 to 7 (0-based index).

Assuming this is the start of the 1st iteration (after the first pair is executed) and `dx` and `dy` will be equal to the second pair:
- `dx` and `dy` would take on values from the second tuple, which is `(-2, 1)`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- The values of `nx` and `ny` would need to be calculated based on the new `dx` and `dy`.
  
We don’t have the current values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` that would affect this outcome since they are not mentioned in the previous state. However, we can conclude that the loop is simply iterating over the pairs.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met.**
