The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are being added to the `queue`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
