The operation `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` modifies the values of `nx` and `ny`. Given that `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, we can calculate:

- `nx` becomes `x + (-2)` which is `x - 2`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 1` which is `y + 1`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, we summarize the output state while updating the values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
