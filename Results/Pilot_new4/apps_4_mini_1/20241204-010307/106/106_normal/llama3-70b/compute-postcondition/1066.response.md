The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged because the code only affects the `queue`.

Since the variable `ncur` reflects an element based on the previously defined state, and `piece` is currently 0, the tuple added to the queue will maintain those values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist` reflects updated shortest path distances, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` stores `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
