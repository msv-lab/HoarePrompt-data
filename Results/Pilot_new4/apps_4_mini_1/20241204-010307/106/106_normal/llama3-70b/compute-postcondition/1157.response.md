The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial state specifies that `nx` is `-1` and `ny` is `0`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment made to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is A[-1][0]**
