In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in coordinates, expressed as `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list.

Based on the current program state provided, we know the following:
- `N` is between 4 and 10, which indicates that the maximum value for `ncur` and `cur` must be within this range, adhering to the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.
- `x` is 3, meaning that it could potentially be adjusted in the loop based on the values of `dx`.
- `y` is 0, which could also be adjusted based on the values of `dy`.

The loop will iterate through the four direction changes: left-up `(-1, -1)`, left-down `(-1, 1)`, right-up `(1, -1)`, and right-down `(1, 1)` resulting in four iterations. After the last iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` would reflect the last tuple from the list.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to consider the state of `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration. If this is the last loop iteration, the next values for `dx` and `dy` should be set to the first tuple in the list again (`(-1, -1)`).

State: **If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, and `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1.**
