The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` modifies the `dist` array. It assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is an index calculated as `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the changes from `dx` and `dy`, but since `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `cur` is not specified in the initial state, we assume it holds some previously defined value (not mentioned). Therefore, after executing the code, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
