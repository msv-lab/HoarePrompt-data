The code updates the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and we do not have specific values for `cur` or `dist`, but we know `dist[2][ncur]` will be incremented based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as the operation only updates the `dist` array. The other variables (`N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) maintain their original values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 0`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
