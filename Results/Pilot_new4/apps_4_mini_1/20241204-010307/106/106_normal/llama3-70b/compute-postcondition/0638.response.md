According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration will update `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (inclusive).
- `y` is 2.
- `x` is an integer in the range `[0, N)`.
- `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, resulting in `nx` being `x - 2` and `ny` being 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next values of `dx` and `dy` need to be taken from the list of tuples. The first iteration of the loop would have handled `(-2, -1)`, then `(-2, 1)` was handled last. 

Thus, the next iteration will take `(-1, -2)`. 

After substituting `dx` with -1 and `dy` with -2, we get:
- `nx = x - 1` 
- `ny = 0` 

We must ensure that both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `ny = 0`, this condition will always hold true because `N` is at least 3, thus `0 < N`. We also have to ensure that `nx = x - 1` is within bounds, which is valid as long as `x > 0`.

To summarize:
- We need `N` to remain in the range of `3 <= N <= 10`.
- The value of `x` must be greater than 0 to ensure `nx` is a valid index after the decrement. 

Therefore, the new values at the start of the next iteration will account for these changes:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 0**.
