Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)`, `(ncur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` assigned the value `(cur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, there are no updates to `dist` or `parent`.***
