The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned the results of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, we can express `nx` as `0 + dx` (which equals `dx`) and `ny` as `1 + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
