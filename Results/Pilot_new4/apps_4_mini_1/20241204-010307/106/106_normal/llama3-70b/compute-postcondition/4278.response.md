Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[1 + dx][N - 1 + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
