Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, and `parent` arrays are initialized. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)` and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`, while the current value of `A[1][0]` remains equal to `cur` and `nx`, `ny` are calculated for each iteration `i` using `dx` and `dy`. If the condition for `nx` and `ny` is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
