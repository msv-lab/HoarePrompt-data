According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Each iteration will unpack the tuples into `dx` and `dy`, affecting the calculations involving `nx` and `ny`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `nx` can either be -1 or 1, and `ny` can either be 1 or 3. The loop is designed to iterate over four pairs of changes in coordinates (`dx`, `dy`), which means that it will execute four times in total. Since it has already executed once for a particular pair of changes, the next iteration will continue to the next pair of changes.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` should reflect the next tuple in the list. If we assume this was the first iteration (i.e., `dx, dy` = (-1, -1)), the next tuple in line would be `(-1, 1)`.

The values of `nx` and `ny` must remain valid, falling within the boundaries defined by `N`, which is an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive). The conditions involving `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, `cur`, and `parent` are dependent on the loop body and do not directly affect the execution state for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1 or 3, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
