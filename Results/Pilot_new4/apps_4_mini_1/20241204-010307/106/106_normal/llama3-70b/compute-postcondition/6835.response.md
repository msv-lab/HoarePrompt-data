The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated with this new value, and given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and `dist[0][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
