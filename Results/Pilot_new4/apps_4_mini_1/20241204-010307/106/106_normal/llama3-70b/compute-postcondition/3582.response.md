The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the distance at position `dist[2][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value of `dist[2][cur]`. The values of `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged from the initial state, while the value of `dist[2][ncur]` now holds a new distance value based on `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
