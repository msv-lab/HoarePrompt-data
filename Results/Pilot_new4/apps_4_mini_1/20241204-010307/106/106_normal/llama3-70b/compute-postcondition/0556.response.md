The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not known from the initial state, but they are now stored into `parent[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is `x - 2`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
