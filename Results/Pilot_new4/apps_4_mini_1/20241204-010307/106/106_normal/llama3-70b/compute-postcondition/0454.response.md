Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. If `nx` and `ny` are both within the bounds of `[0, N)`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue includes `(ncur, 0)`. If either `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or the queue.***
