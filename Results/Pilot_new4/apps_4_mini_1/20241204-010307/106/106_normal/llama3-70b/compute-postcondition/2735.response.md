The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the specified index `[0][ncur]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `cur` and `piece`, but their specific values are not known from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the update to `parent`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
