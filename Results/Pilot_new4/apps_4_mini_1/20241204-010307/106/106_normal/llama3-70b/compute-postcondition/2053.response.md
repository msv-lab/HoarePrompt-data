Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, and `piece` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are taken from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], with `nx` as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy` for each respective `dx` and `dy`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is satisfied, then `piece` is updated to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
