Given the initial state and code snippet:

Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, and the loop has completed its iterations.

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

In this code snippet, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is `N - 1`
- `dx` and `dy` are presumably defined elsewhere and are integers.

After the assignment:
- `nx` will become `1 + dx`
- `ny` will become `(N - 1) + dy`

No other variables are affected, so we maintain the original constraints for `N`, `x`, and `y`.

The output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`**
