The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the specified index `[0][ncur]` to a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not mentioned in the initial state, but we assume they are defined in the broader context.

The other variables, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The only change involves the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -2, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece).**
