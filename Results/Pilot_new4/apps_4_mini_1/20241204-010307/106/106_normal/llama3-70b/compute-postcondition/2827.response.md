The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial state as `nx = x + 2` and `ny = y + 1`. The index `n` is constrained to be an integer between `3` and `10`. The initial state of `piece` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

The output state will indicate the values of `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`, where `ncur` is now defined as `A[nx][ny]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
