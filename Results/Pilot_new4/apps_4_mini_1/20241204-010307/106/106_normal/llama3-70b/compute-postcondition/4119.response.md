The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values calculated from `x` and `y` using `dx` and `dy`. The value of `x` is `0`, and `dx` is `-2`, so `nx` becomes `0 + (-2)`, which is `-2`. The value of `y` is `2`, and `dy` is `-1`, so `ny` becomes `2 + (-1)`, which is `1`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1**.
