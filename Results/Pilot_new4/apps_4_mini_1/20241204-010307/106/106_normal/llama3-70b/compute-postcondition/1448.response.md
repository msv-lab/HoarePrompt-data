The operation performed by the code snippet is appending a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue` list. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. Since `ncur` is `A[3][0]`, it has a specific value based on the array `A` that we cannot determine without further information. However, the output state reflects that `ncur` remains unchanged and that a new entry is added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 3; `ny` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is `A[3][0]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; an entry `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`.**
