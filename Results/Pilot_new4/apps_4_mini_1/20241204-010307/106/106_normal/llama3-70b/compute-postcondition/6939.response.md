The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now included in `queue`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is A[nx][ny]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
