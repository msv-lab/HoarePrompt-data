Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the previous pairs and now also includes `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`, and if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
