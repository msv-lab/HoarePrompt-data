The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged, but the `queue` now contains an additional element.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ncur` and `1` have been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
