According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples that represent the possible directional moves (up, down, left, right). Each iteration uses the variables `dx` and `dy` to determine the next position to check. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `y` is -1, and the loop has not yet processed all the possible directional moves. Since the `for` loop itself does not rely on any external conditions (like index bounds), it will execute for each element in the provided list of tuples. For the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be set to the next tuple in the list of moves.

The current loop state is at the beginning of its iterations over the four possible moves. The next values for `dx` and `dy` after the last iteration will be:

1. First iteration: (-1, 0) 
2. Second iteration: (1, 0) 
3. Third iteration: (0, -1) 
4. Fourth iteration: (0, 1)

Since the loop has not yet completed all iterations, it is safe to state that in the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will correspond to (0, -1) in its third iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece` when both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1**
