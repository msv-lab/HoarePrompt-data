The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
