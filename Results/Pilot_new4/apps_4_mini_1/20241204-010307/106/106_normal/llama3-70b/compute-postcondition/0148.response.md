In the given code, the statement `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables that are involved in this operation are `ncur`, which has been assigned a value from `A[nx][ny]`, and the integer `1`. The `queue` variable is updated to include this new tuple.

The output state remains unchanged for all other variables that are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `0 â‰¤ nx, ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
