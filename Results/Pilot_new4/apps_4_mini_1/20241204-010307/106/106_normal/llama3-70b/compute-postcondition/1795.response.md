The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to 3. However, the specific values of `A`, `x`, and how `A` is indexed are not provided.

Thus, the output state remains largely unchanged except for `ncur`, which will depend on the values of `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, the value of `ncur` will be determined by the list or array `A` at the position specified by `nx` and `ny`.

Since we don't have specific values for `A` or `x`, we can't specify the exact value of `ncur`, but we can indicate that it is assigned from that expression.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
