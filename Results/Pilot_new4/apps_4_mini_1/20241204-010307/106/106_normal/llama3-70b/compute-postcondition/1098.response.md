The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are given as 2 and 1 respectively. Since `N` can be between 3 and 10, it does not affect the assignment directly but `A` must be a valid 2D array/matrix that can be indexed with these values. The states of `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged; `parent` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`.**
