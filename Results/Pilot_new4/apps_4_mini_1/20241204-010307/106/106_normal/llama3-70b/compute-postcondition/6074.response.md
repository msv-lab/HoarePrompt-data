The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Since `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, `A[nx][ny]` is a valid reference. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but now we know the value of `ncur` based on the values in the array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
