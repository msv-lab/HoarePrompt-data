According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the changes in x and y coordinates, which are `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. The loop will execute regardless of the specific values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `cur`, `dist`, and `parent`, as the loop has a fixed number of iterations based on the length of the list.

However, to ensure meaningful operations within the loop, the variables `dx` and `dy` must be valid and should allow for updates to `dist` and `parent`. 

Since itâ€™s stated that if the loop does not execute, `queue` must be empty, we can infer that for the loop to execute properly, there should be reachable positions that can be added to `queue`. Therefore, we need to guarantee:

1. That the queue contains positions that can be updated in `dist` and `parent`.
2. The current position `A[x][y]` should have valid neighbors that are reachable.

For the loop to execute, certain adjustments can be made to guarantee that these conditions hold. The position `(x + dx, y + dy)` must be valid and within the bounds of `A` for at least some `dx`, `dy`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and `queue` must not be empty.**
