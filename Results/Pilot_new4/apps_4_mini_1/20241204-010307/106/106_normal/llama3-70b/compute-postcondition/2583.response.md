According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` which represent the four possible diagonal directions. Since the loop will execute for each pair in the list `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, it will execute a total of 4 times.

At the end of the last iteration, no specific state for `(dx, dy)` was mentioned. However, as the loop is currently structured, it will continue to execute for each of the four pairs, starting from the first one and going to the last.

Since we know that this is the final iteration, we can conclude that the loop has already executed for three pairs of `(dx, dy)`. If we denote the current pair as the fourth pair `dy` being the last iteration, then only after this the loop will terminate.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, it must be allowed to proceed to the fourth pair. After the last iteration with the last pair `(1, 1)`, `dx` will be `1` and `dy` will be `1`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and both `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
