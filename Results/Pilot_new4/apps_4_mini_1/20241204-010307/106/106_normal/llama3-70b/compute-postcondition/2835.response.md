The variables `dx` and `dy` both hold the value -1. The code calculates `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not given, so we denote them as `x` and `y`. Thus, `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` becomes `y - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `queue` contains all relevant tuples of reachable positions with piece value `0`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`.**
