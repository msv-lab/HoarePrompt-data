The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The initial values are `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is 1. 

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx = 1 + (-2) = -1`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 1 = 1`

Now, we express the output state including the updated values and existing conditions:
`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; otherwise, no changes occur if the condition 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N is not met.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; otherwise, no changes occur if the condition 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N is not met.**
