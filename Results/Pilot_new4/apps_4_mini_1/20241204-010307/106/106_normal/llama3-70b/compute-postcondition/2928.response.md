The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[1][ncur]` to be equal to the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The condition indicates that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than this new value, meaning that the update will result in a smaller distance at that position. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent` reflects the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
