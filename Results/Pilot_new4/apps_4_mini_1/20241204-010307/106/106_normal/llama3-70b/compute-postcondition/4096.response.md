According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes in coordinates: up, down, left, and right. Each iteration updates `nx` and `ny` based on `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `x` as 0 and `y` as 1. During the next iteration of the loop, the first set of directional changes `(-1, 0)` would set `nx` and `ny` as follows:

- For `dx = -1`, `dy = 0`: `nx` becomes `x + dx = 0 - 1 = -1` and `ny` becomes `y + dy = 1 + 0 = 1`. Since `-1 < 0`, this condition fails.
- For `dx = 1`, `dy = 0`: `nx` becomes `0 + 1 = 1` and `ny` remains `1`. This condition passes since `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied if `N` is at least 2. 
- For `dx = 0`, `dy = -1`: `nx` remains `0` and `ny` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`. This condition also passes.
- For `dx = 0`, `dy = 1`: `nx` remains `0` and `ny` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. This condition passes if `N` is at least 3.

In terms of the `N` boundary conditions, since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, the conditions on `nx` and `ny` for the next iterations need to reflect those values of `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [0, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2]**
