Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` can be -1 or 1, `ny` can be 0 or 2, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations, `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true. Additionally, `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
