To analyze the impact of the code, we first note the initial state of the variables:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is equal to `x + 1`
- `ny` is equal to `3`

The code snippet provided is:
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Here, `nx` is being assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is being assigned the value of `y + dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not given in the initial state.

Since we lack the specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine the exact new values for `nx` and `ny`. We can only express them in terms of their initial states.

- `nx` is updated to `x + dx` (the new value is dependent on `dx`)
- `ny` is updated to `2 + dy` (since `y` is initially 2, the new value is dependent on `dy`)

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes to `nx` and `ny` while retaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`**
