The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `1` are used as the elements of the tuple being appended. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, meaning their values do not affect the execution of this line of code. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`.**
