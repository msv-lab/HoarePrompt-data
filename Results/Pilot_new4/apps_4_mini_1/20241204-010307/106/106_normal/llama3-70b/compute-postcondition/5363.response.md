To analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. The variables `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively.
2. The current values of the variables are: `x` = 4 and `y` = 1. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, which means we cannot determine the exact new values of `nx` and `ny`.
3. Since `nx` and `ny` will change based on the values of `dx` and `dy`, we can only state that `nx` will be equal to `4 + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `1 + dy`.

The states of the other variables, `N` and `x`, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
