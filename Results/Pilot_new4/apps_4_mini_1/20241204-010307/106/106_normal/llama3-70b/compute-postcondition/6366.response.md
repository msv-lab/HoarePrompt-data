Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and `ny` is between 0 and N-1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
