Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no changes occur.***
