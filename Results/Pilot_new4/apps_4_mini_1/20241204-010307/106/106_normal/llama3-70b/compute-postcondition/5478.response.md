In the given code snippet, `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but we do not have information about the values of `cur` or `A`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]` in terms of `dist[1][cur]`.

1. The code updates `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[1][cur]`. 
2. The previous values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects that `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated while keeping the other variables intact:

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
