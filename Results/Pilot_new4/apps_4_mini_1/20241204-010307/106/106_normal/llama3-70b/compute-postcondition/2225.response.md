The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, and `piece` remains unchanged. The other variables retain their previous values, except for `parent`, which is updated. The initial state indicates `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is dependent on specific values of `nx` and `ny`, but we do not change `ncur` here. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables and the new assignment in `parent`.

Output State: **`piece` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[1][cur]` increases by 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
