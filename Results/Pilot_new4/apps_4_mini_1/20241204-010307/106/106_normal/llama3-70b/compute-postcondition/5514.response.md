Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2. If the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` reflects the minimum distances from the starting point to each valid `ncur` position, `parent[2]` contains the corresponding parent positions for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` appended to its previous contents. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
