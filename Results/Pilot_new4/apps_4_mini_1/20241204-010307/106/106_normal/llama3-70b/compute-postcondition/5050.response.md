Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from `(3, 0)` to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions, `queue` contains all valid tuples added during the loop execution. If no positions were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
