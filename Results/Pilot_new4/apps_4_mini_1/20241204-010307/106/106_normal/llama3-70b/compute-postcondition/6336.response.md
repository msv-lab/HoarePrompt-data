The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (not directly affected)
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `dx` and `dy` are likely representing the change in coordinates, but their values are not provided directly in the initial state.
- `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`
- `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes
- `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances
- `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the dx and dy movements.

The expressions for `nx` and `ny` are:
- `nx` becomes `0 + dx` (which is simply `dx`)
- `ny` becomes `0 + dy` (which is simply `dy`)

We do not have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, so we cannot determine exact numerical values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we can conclude that both `nx` and `ny` will take the values of `dx` and `dy`, respectively.

Therefore, the output state will indicate the changes made to `nx` and `ny` based on `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the dx and dy movements.**
