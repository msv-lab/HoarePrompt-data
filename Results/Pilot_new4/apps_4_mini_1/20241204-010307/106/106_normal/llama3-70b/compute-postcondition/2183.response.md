The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are used directly in this operation, but no other variables are affected. The initial states of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain valid after the execution.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is the value of A[x + 1][y], `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
