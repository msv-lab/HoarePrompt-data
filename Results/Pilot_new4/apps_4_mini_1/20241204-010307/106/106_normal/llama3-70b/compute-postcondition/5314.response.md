Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains path information for valid `ncur`; `queue` contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where `piece` is 1; `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples during iterations. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
