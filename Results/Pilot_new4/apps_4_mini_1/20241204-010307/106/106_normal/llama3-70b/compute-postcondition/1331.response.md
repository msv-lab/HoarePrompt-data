The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` results in the computation of new values for `nx` and `ny`. Given the initial values, `x` is 2, `dx` is -1, and `y` is 0, `dy` is -2. 

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + (-2) = -2`

Now we have:
- `nx` is updated to 1
- `ny` is updated to -2

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. The previous conditions and states of the other variables are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples and includes `(ncur, 0)`, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2**
