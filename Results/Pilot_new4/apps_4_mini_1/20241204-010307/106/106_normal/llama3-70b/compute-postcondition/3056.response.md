The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are dependent on `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
