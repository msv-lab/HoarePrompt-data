Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and the pairs `(nx, ny)` are valid indices within the range [0, 5] for each iteration of the loop. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
