In the given code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is already defined as `x - 1` and `ny` as `y`. The `dist` variable remains unchanged and continues to hold the minimum distances.

Since `ncur` is updated based on the values from `A`, we express it directly in the output state. The values of `dist[1][ncur]` and the variables `nx` and `ny` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
