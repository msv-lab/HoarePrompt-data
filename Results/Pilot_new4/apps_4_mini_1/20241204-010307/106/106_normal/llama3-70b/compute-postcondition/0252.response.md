`parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and it is also given the value of `piece`. The previous state indicates `ncur` is determined by the indices `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, which remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `iteration count`, `ncur`, and the updated `dist` remain valid as stated. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; iteration count is 4; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; iteration count is 4; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
