The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, respectively. However, since the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output will reflect that `nx` and `ny` are defined by the expressions involving `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**
