Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `(nx, ny)` are valid indices, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.***
