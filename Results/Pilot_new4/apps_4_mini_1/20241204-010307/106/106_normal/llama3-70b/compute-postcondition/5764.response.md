Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
