Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[2]` contains potential updated distances for valid cells, `parent[2]` contains corresponding parents for valid cells, and `queue` has tuples of updated `(ncur, 2)` for valid transitions; if no valid updates occur, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
