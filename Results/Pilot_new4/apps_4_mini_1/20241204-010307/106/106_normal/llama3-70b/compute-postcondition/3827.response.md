Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position; `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
