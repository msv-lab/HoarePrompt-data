Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, piece), and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made.***
