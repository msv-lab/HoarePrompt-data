Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N. The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
