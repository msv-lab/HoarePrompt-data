The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The existing variables in the initial state are not modified by this operation; instead, a new entry is added to the `queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
