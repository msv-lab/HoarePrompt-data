According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing directional changes `(dx, dy)`. The loop can execute regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as these variables do not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

However, to understand the context of the loop execution, we need to consider how many times the loop will iterate. The list has a fixed length of 8 tuples. 

Since there are no preceding conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute, we can conclude that no adjustments to the current states are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `(dx, dy)` will iterate over the 8 directional changes.**
