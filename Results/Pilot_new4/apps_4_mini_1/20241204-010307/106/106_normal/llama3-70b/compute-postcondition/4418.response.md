The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, where `dx` and `dy` take their values from the set [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]. The variables `N`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x` and `y` and will determine the specific value of `ncur` based on the contents of the two-dimensional array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `A` is a valid two-dimensional array; `cur` is defined; `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point; `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move; `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dx` and `dy` take the next values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
