According to the code, the for loop will execute for each pair of `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 pairs. The loop iterates through these pairs one by one. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, and the values of `nx` and `ny` have already been calculated based on the last `(dx, dy)` used in that iteration.

Since the state at the end of the last iteration gives us that `dx` and `dy` were used for one of the pairs in the iteration, we need to determine what the next pair will be. The loop will proceed to the next iteration with the next `(dx, dy)` from the list.

After the last iteration, if it was on the last pair `(0, 1)`, the loop would have finished executing. However, if it was on the first three pairs, the next state of `(dx, dy)` will be the next pair in the list.

Therefore, in the case where the last iteration used the pair `(0, 1)`, there are no more pairs left for the loop to execute. However, if it was on the third pair `(0, -1)`, the next pair to be used is `(0, 1)`.

Given that the loop can execute a total of 4 times, we need to state the expected conditions based on the last executed pair.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, with the next `(dx, dy)` pair being (0, 1)**
