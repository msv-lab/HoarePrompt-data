Postcondition: ***`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the current distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
