The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial conditions state that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which means that after the update, `dist[1][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
