Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1`, `ny` is `1`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` if the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true; otherwise, no changes are made.
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```
Now, please think step by step: The code calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the changes `dx` and `dy`. The value of `nx` will be `0 + dx` and `ny` will be `1 + dy`. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact final values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` will have no changes unless the condition holds true.**
