The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous state of `parent` is not provided, but it is assumed that the values in the parent list can be updated. The variable `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the new value `(cur, piece)`, while no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is the current value of `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
