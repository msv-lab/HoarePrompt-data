After executing the code snippet, the variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variable values remain unchanged, but it's important to note that the condition `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` will still be valid after the assignment. 

So, the output state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `y` is less than `N` and has been incremented to `y + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur]` is still valid.**
