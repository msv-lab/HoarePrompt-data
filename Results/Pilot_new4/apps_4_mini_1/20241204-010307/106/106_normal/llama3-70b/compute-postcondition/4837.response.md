The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and that `N` is between 3 and 10. The other variables, including `dx`, `dy`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, `x`, and `y`, are not altered by this operation. 

The output state reflects that a new element has been added to the `queue`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
