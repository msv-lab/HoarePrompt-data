In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the coordinates `x`, `y`, and the directional offsets `dx`, `dy`. The variable `y` is equal to `N`, which is an integer between 3 and 10. Therefore, `ny` will be calculated as `N + dy`, while `nx` will be calculated as `x + dx`. 

Since `N` is in the range of 3 to 10, `y` (which equals `N`) can take those values, and the resultant values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. However, we do not have specific values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`, so `nx` remains as `x + dx` and `ny` as `N + dy`.

The states of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is a valid current position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
