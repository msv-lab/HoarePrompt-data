Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]` and if `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
