The `queue` is updated to include a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` as an element. The previous values of the variables `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are unaffected by this operation. The output state now reflects the addition of the new item in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is equal to `0`; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
