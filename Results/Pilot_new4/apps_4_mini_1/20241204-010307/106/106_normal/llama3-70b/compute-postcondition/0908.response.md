Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][2]`, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
