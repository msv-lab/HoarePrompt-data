The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the prior calculations involving `nx` and `ny`, which depend on `dx` and `dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged, but `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to the value of `cur` and `piece`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
