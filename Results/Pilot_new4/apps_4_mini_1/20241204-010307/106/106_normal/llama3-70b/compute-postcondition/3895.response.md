The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are assumed to be defined in the code context provided. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`

The updated variable is:
- `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Since `parent[1][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`, the output state will reflect the changes made while keeping the rest of the variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
