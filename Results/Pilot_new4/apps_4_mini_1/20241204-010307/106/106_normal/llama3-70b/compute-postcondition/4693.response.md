To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions required for the loop to execute and the changes made to the variables during its execution.

1. The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which means it will always execute exactly 4 times regardless of the values of `N` and `y`.
2. For each iteration, `nx` and `ny` are computed based on `x` and `y` along with the current `dx` and `dy`.
3. The conditions involving `nx` and `ny` must be satisfied: `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. This ensures that `ncur` is valid and can be indexed into the array `A`.
4. If the condition `piece == 1` and `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` are satisfied, then the distance and parent are updated and `ncur` is added to the `queue`.
5. If none of these conditions are met for any of the iterations, the variables remain unchanged.

Given that the initial state allows for the loop to execute, we can summarize the variables as follows after all iterations:

- `N` remains an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` remains equal to 2.
- The values of `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `queue` depend on the values in the array `A` and the initial values of `dist` and `parent`, as well as the valid indices determined by `nx` and `ny`.

If none of the conditions are satisfied throughout all iterations, the values would essentially remain as they were initially. If at least one iteration updates the values based on the conditions, the respective variables `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` would reflect those updates.

Thus, the final output state can be stated as:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated if conditions met, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated if conditions met, `queue` contains positions added during the iterations if conditions were satisfied.**
