The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the distance for the index `ncur` in the `dist` array. The value being assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is derived from the current distance `dist[0][cur]` plus 1, indicating that the distance to index `ncur` has increased by one from its predecessor `cur`. 

Assuming `cur` was defined earlier and its value is valid for indexing into `dist`, this operation will specifically affect the `dist` variable while the other provided variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
