Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 2`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (if it were in bounds). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not met, no operations are executed.***
