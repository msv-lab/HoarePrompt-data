According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration modifies the current values of `dx` and `dy` from the tuples in the list. After the last iteration, `dx` is 2 and `dy` is 1. The loop will execute one more time, but since this is the last iteration of the list, it will be using the last tuple `(2, 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, and `nx` is equal to `x + 2`. The conditions for `nx` and `ny` must be checked:

1. `nx = x + dx` (which is `x + 2`) and `ny = y + dy` (which is `2 + 1 = 3`).
2. We need to ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. 

If the conditions are met, the values of `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` can be updated as described.

Since the loop iterates through the given tuples and uses the last values of `dx` and `dy`, we would prepare for the next iteration by increasing the loop counter or preparing the next set of values.

However, since we need to adjust for the next execution of the loop, `dx` and `dy` will take on the next tuple `(2, 1)` which means they stay the same, and we won't have another change in `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`** (No change in states occurs as we have exhausted the defined tuples in the list).
