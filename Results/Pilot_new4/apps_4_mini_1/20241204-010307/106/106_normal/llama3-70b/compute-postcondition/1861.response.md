Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. The value of `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
