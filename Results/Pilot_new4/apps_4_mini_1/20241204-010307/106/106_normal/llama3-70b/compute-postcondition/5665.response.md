The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `A` is a 2D array and `nx` and `ny` are defined as `dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds specified by `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The conditions state that `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning the values of `nx` and `ny` are valid indices for the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
