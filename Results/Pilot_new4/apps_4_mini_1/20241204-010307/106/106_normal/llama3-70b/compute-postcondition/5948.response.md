Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes the new element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
