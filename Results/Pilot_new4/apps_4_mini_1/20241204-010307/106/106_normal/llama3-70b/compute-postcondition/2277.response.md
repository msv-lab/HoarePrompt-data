According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` in relation to `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `y` is such that it must be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration. 

If `y` is equal to the last iteration value (which is `N-1`), then for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be equal to `N`. Thus, we can conclude that the loop will not execute again if `y` is already at `N`.

Since `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are not altered in this loop, their states remain unchanged, and we need to set the value of `y` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N**
