The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the relevant information remaining in the output state is that `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 5, or 4, `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the selected `dx` and `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, making it no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
