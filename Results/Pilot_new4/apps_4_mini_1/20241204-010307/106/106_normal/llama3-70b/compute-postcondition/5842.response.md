The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` has been assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, and since `piece` is equal to 2, we know that the condition `dist[2][ncur]` being greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` holds. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` has changed according to the assignment. The other variables retain their original conditions, with no changes:

- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`
- `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to 2

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
