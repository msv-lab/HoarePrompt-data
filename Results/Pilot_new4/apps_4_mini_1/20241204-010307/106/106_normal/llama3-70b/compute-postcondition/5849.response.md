To determine the impact of the provided code, we analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`
- `piece` is 2
- `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is 0
- `nx` is 2
- `ny` is 0

The code snippet assigns a new value to `ncur` based on the values of `nx` and `ny`:

```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

Here, `nx` is 2 and `ny` is 0. Thus, `ncur` will be assigned the value of `A[2][0]`.

Since no other variables were modified or affected by this operation, we only need to update the value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[2][0]**
