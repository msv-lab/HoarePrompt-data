The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array for `ncur` based on the value of `cur`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which makes them equal. Hence, the condition that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` will no longer hold true after this assignment.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position + 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position + 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
