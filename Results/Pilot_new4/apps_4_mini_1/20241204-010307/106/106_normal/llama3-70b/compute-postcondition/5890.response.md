The line of code updates a specific element in the `dist` array. The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which indicates that the specific index in the `dist` array is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, it implies that both `nx` and `ny` are derived from active variables that depending on `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`.

The state of `dist[0][ncur]` changes, but the other state variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
