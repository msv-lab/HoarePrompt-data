The value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` using the indices `nx` and `ny`, which are determined by `dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so its previous value is unknown. The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change, maintaining all the other initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
