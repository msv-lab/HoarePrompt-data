The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `1` and `0`, respectively. The state of the other variables remains unchanged since this assignment does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`.**
