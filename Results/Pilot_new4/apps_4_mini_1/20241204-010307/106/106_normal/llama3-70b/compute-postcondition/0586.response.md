Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is appended with the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
