The `queue` is modified by appending a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to it. The values of `ncur` and `2` are included in the tuple. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged, thus the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, piece); `queue` includes the tuple (ncur, 2).**
