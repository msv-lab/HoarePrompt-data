Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions based on the conditions specified during the loop execution, `parent[1]` tracks the previous position and piece for each reachable position, and `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples that were added during the loop execution. If no conditions are satisfied, `dist[1]` remains unchanged from its initial state, `parent[1]` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `queue` remains empty.**
