The value of `ncur` has already been assigned from `A[nx][ny]`, and the values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` have been set based on `dist[1][cur]` and `cur`, respectively. The code snippet adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 â‰¤ `nx`, `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`; `queue` has a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
