Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` additionally contains the tuple (ncur, 2), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`. If the condition of the if statement is not satisfied, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged.***
