The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive). The values of `N`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
