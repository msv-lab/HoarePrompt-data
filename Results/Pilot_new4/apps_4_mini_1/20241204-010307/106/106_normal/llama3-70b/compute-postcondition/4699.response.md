The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated based on prior conditions, `queue` is properly populated with positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
