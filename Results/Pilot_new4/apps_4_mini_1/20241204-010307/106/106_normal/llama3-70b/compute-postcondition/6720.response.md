The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. Given the initial state where `x` is 1, `dx` is -1, `y` is 1, and `dy` is 0, we can calculate the new values:

1. `nx` is updated to `1 + (-1)`, which equals `0`.
2. `ny` is updated to `1 + 0`, which equals `1`.

This results in the updated values `nx = 0` and `ny = 1`. Since the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, we will report the updated values along with the remaining valid variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1).**
