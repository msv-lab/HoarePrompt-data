The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculation `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `nx` and `ny` are both between 0 and `N-1`, and we need to consider the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` to determine the new values of `nx` and `ny`. Since we do not have specific values for `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`, it can be stated that `nx` and `ny` will now depend on the values of those variables.

Output State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.**
