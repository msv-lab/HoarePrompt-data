According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `piece` is equal to `1`, and the values `nx` and `ny` have been calculated as `x - 1` and `y + 1`, respectively. 

The loop will execute for each of the four direction pairs (dx, dy). The first iteration would correspond to the first pair `(-1, -1)`, and subsequent iterations would proceed through the other pairs. Since we need to prepare for the next iteration, we must determine the current state in relation to which pair is being processed next.

After the last iteration, if all pairs have been processed, we would be moving to the next pair. However, if we are still in the first three pairs, we simply need to adjust the pair being used.

Since the details of the iteration state (current pair processed) are not explicitly provided but are implied based on how the loop operates, we need to consider that two pairs have been processed, and now we are set to process the third pair.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is `y + 1`, pair is `(1, -1)`**
