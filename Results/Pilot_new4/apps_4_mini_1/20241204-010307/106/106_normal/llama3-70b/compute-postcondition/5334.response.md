The assignment statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and `piece` does not affect any variables directly in this context. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`, this implies that `parent[2][ncur]` is now set to the value of `cur`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]; parent[2][ncur] is now equal to `cur`.**
