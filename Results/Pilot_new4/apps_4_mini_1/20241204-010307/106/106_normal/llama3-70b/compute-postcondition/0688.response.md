The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The initial states of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, but `parent[2][ncur]` is now set to the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, so we cannot know their specific values. However, we do know that `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][2]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**
