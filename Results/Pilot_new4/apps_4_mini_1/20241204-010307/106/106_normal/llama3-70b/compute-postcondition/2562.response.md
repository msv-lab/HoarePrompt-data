Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `piece`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no updates are performed.***
