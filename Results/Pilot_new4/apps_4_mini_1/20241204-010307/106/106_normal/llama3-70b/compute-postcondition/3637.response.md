Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid. If both `nx` and `ny` are within bounds, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes occur.***
