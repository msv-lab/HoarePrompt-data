Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; if `piece` is 2, then `dist[2][ncur]` will have been updated for any reachable positions from `cur`, `parent[2][ncur]` will reflect the last position leading to `ncur`, and `queue` will contain tuples of all updated `ncur` values. If `piece` is not 2 or the conditions for updating are not met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged from their original state.**
