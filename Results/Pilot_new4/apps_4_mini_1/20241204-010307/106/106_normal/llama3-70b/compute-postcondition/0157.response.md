The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`, which ensures that `dist[2][ncur]` is now greater than `dist[2][cur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` are still valid after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
