The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]` with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of the affected variables were not specified, so we will keep the original state for those that remain unchanged.

The output state should reflect the change in the `parent` variable while retaining the other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
