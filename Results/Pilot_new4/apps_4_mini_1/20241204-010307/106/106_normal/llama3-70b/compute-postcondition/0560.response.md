Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)` based on the given conditions, with `dist[0][ncur]` containing the minimum distance from `cur` for the positions that have been processed; `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position; `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions that were added during the loop execution; all other variables remain unchanged if the conditions were not satisfied for their respective indices.**
