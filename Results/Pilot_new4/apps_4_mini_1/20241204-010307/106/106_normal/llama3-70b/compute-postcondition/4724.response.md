Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10` and `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid positions based on the grid `A`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid state from `cur`, and `queue` contains tuples of valid positions including the new addition `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
