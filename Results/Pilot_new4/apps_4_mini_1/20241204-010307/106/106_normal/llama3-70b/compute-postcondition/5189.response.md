The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `x` and `y` respectively, where `nx = x - 2` and `ny = y + 1`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, and `y` is between 1 and N-1. Since `nx` results in `x - 2`, `nx` will be between -2 and N-3, and since `ny` results in `y + 1`, `ny` will be between 2 and N. 

The access to `A[nx][ny]` depends on the actual values of `nx` and `ny`, which are derived from `x` and `y`. However, without specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State retains the information about `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
