The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The new values of `nx` and `ny` become `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state of `N`, `y`, and `piece` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while other variables retain their original constraints.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
