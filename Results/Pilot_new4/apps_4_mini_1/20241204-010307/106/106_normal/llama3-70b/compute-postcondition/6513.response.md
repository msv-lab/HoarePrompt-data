The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` indicate that the distance is being updated based on the current position. The other variables remain unchanged, but now `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to reflect the current node and the piece. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` must not be empty to ensure valid moves exist, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` must not be empty to ensure valid moves exist, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
