The code snippet involves appending a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist[0][ncur]` are unchanged; only the `queue` is affected. The variable `ncur` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a valid value within the context.

Since `queue` is being modified by appending the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, we will indicate that the state of `queue` has changed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
