The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but the variable `ncur` has already been assigned a value based on `A[nx][ny]`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]` with the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
