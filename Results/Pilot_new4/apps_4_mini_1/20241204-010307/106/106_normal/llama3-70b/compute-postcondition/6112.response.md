The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, which is derived from the current position `(x, y)` after moving `dx = -1` (upwards). Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the value of `cur`. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
