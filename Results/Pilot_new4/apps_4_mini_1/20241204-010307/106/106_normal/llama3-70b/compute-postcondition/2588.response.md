Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
