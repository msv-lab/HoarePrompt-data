The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations of `x + dx` and `y + dy`. 

Given that:

- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `dx` is 0
- `dy` is -1

We can calculate:

- `nx = x + dx = 1 + 0 = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + (-1) = -1`

The values of `N`, `piece`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1**
