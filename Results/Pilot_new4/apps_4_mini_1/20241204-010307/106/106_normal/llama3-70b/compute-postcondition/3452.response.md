Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` has been updated to `x + dx`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` positions along with `0` for piece, distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; tuples for (dx, dy) are valid for execution; the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals `1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
