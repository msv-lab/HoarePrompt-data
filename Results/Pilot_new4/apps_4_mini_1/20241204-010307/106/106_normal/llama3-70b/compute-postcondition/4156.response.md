The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The value of `x` is 0, and `dx` is -1, which results in `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`. The value of `y` is 2, and `dy` is 1, which results in `ny = 2 + 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 3, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 3, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
