According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples in the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. The variable `dx` takes the values from this list in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -1, which means that the next values of `dx` and `dy` in the subsequent iteration will be (1, 0).

The loop will execute one more time as long as there are more tuples in the list for `dx` and `dy`. Since we have already processed the first tuple (-1, 0), the next tuple (1, 0) will be processed in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`**
