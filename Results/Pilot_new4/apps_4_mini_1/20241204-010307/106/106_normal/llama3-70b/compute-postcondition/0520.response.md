In the given code snippet, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variables `ncur`, `dist`, and `cur` are the only ones affected by this operation. 

1. The variable `ncur` has been previously assigned the value `A[x - 1][2]`.
2. The variable `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is necessary for the calculation of `dist[2][cur]`. Since we don't have its initial value, we can't provide a specific number for `dist[2][ncur]` after the operation. However, we can express the output in terms of the existing variables.

The value of `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
