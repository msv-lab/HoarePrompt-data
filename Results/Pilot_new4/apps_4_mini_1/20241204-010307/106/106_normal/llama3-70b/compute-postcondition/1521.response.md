Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `x` and `y` must be such that `0 <= x + dx < N` and `0 <= y + dy < N` for each `(dx, dy)`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
