The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` have not changed from their previous state, but `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the new value of `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
