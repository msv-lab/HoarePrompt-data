The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given the initial states: `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 0, `ny` becomes `y + 0` which is equal to `1`, and `nx` becomes `x + 0` which is equal to `x`. 

Thus:
- `nx` is equal to `x`
- `ny` is equal to `1`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 0.**
