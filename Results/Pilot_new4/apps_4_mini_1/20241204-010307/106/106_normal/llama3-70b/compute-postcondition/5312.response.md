According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements. The loop will always execute because the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]` contains 4 elements, so no adjustments are needed for the loop to iterate. However, the states related to `dx` and `dy` should be specified for each iteration of the loop.

Since `N` is between 4 and 10, it does not directly influence the execution of the loop itself. The variables `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are prepared for the loop's logic, but they do not prevent the loop from executing.

The states for this loop execution are as follows:

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains path information for valid `ncur`, `queue` contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where `piece` is 1, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples during iterations**.
