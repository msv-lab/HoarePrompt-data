Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The variable `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting point to `ncur` (given by `dist[0][ncur]`) is greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` (given by `dist[0][cur]`) plus 1.***
