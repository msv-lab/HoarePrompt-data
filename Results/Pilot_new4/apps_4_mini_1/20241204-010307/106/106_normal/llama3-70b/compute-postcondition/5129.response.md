The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1 (from the next direction pair `(1, 1)`), we calculate:

- `nx = x + dx = 3 + 1 = 4`
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + 1 = 2`

The other variables (`N`, `piece`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged, and the precondition remains valid as `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are still satisfied since `N` is between 4 and 10.

Output State: **`0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 4, `ny` is 2**
