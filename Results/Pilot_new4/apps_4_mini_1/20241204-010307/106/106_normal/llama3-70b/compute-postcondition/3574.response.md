The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[2][cur]`. The value of `dist[2][ncur]` becomes `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variables `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur` are assumed to hold specific values based on the context provided. The values of `dist[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][cur]` are updated, while `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]`:

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
