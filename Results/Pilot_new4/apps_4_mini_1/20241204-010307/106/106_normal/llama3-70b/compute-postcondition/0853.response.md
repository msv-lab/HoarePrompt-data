The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, and the changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are both 0. Therefore, `nx` becomes `0 + dx` and `ny` becomes `0 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
