Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `[0, N)`, then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)` and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made.***
