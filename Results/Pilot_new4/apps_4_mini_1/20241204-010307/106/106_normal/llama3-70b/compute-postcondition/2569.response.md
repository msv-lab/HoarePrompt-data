The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The state of the affected variables needs to be assessed first. Since the values of `ncur` and `queue` are directly impacted by this operation:

- The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, which has a specific value based on the values of `x` and `y`.
- The variable `queue` is assumed to be an existing list, and with this operation, a new tuple will be added to it.

The other variables (`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, `cur`, and `piece`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ncur` has been calculated based on previous values, and a tuple containing it has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer less than `N`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
