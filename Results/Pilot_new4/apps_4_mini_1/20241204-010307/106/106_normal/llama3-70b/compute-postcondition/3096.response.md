The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so `nx` and `ny` will depend on these unspecified values. Consequently, `nx` will equal `x + dx` and `ny` will equal `y + dy`, where `y` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`.**
