Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is false, no operations are performed.***
