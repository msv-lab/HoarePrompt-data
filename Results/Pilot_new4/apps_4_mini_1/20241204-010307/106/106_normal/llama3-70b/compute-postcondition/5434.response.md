Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and `ny` is between 0 and N-1. The value of `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` plus 1 (i.e., `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1`).***
