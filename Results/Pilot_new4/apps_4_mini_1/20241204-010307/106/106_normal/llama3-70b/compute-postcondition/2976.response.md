Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied for any reachable positions, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` will represent the shortest distances, `parent[2][ncur]` will point to the predecessors, and `queue` will reflect all valid processed positions. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
