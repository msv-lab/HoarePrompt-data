Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances from the starting point for valid moves, `parent[0]` contains the parent references for the valid moves, `queue` contains tuples of valid positions and their piece type, and all iterations of valid moves have been considered based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their states before the loop.**
