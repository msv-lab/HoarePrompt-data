To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's examine the given conditions and the for loop statement.

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`. This means the loop will execute a total of four times, each time with different values for `dx` and `dy`.

2. **Iteration Information**: 
   - The initial state indicates that `y` is 1, which is the current row index, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. 
   - The loop will modify `dx` and `dy` in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we need to identify which iteration of the loop was executed last to determine the values for `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The first iteration will have `(dx, dy) = (-1, 0)`.
   - The second iteration will have `(dx, dy) = (1, 0)`.
   - The third iteration will have `(dx, dy) = (0, -1)`.
   - The fourth iteration will have `(dx, dy) = (0, 1)`.

Given that the loop has executed until the last valid tuple, if we're currently at the end of the last iteration, we need to identify the state for the next possible iteration.

4. **Next Iteration State**: After the fourth iteration, there are no more tuples left to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will not execute again, and we need to adjust our state to reflect that `dx` and `dy` will not change further.

Thus, the next state will indicate that the loop has completed its execution:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 0, and `dy` is 0 (indicating no further changes), and no further processing will occur.**
