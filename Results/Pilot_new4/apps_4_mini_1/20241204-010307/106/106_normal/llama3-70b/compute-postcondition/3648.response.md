The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the previous values of `x` and `y`, adding `dx` and `dy` respectively. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided. Therefore, we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)` corresponding to valid moves**.
