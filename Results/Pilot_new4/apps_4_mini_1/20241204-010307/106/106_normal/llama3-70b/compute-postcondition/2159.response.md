Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index where conditions hold true, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each index updated during the loop. If `piece` remains 1, distances in `dist[1][...]` represent the shortest paths calculated, while if the loop does not execute, `dist` remains unchanged and `parent` retains its original state.**
