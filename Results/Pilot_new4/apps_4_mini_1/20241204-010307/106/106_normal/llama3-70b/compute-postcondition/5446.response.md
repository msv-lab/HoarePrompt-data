Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
