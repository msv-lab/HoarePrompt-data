According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes (dx, dy). For the loop to execute again, it will take the next tuple from this list on each iteration. Currently, `dx` and `dy` are set to the first tuple `(-2, -1)`.

Since the loop will move to the next tuple after this one, we will need to update `dx` and `dy` to the values of the next tuple in the list, which are `(-2, 1)` for the second iteration. 

Additionally, the value of `piece` needs to be evaluated based on the condition that checks if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. However, since no further details are given about the values of `dist[0][ncur]` or `dist[0][cur]`, we cannot determine the exact state for `piece`. Thus, it will remain as is unless specified otherwise.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**
