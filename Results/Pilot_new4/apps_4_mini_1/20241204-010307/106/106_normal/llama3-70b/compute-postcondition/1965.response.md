The `queue` is updated to include a new tuple consisting of `(ncur, 1)`. The previous state of `queue` is not specified, but it will now contain the new element added. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is equal to 1, `y` is equal to 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current value of `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`.**
