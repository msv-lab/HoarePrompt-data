The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are used as they are, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `ncur` has already been assigned a value based on the expression `A[x - 4][0]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of this new tuple to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 4][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
