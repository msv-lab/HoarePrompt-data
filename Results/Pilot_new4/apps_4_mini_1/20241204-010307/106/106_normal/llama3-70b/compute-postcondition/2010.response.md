Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to `queue`. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
