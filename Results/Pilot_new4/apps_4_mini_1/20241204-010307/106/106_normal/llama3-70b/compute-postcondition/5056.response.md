The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that the distance `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` before this assignment, it is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, indicating that the shortest distance to the position `ncur` has been updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions, `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
