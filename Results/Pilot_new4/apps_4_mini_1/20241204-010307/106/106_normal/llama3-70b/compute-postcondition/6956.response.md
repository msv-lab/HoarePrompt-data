The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates a specific element in a 2D array `dist`. The value at `dist[1][ncur]` is set to be one more than the current value at `dist[1][cur]`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is 2
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`
- `cur` is defined
- `piece` is 1

The value of `dist[1][ncur]` will depend on the previous value of `dist[1][cur]`, but since we do not have specific values for `dist` or any calculations provided for `cur` or `ncur`, we can only state the relationship.

After the assignment, the output state reflects that `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `cur` is defined, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
