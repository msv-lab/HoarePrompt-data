The code assigns the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, we need to note that the value in `dist[0]` at the index `ncur` will now be updated based on the current value at `cur`, increased by 1.

However, we do not have specific values for `dist`, `cur`, or the contents of `A`, so we can only describe the change in terms of their relationships.

The output state will reflect that the distance at index `ncur` is updated with the new calculation. The other variables remain unchanged as their states are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
