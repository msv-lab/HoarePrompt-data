Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, and `ny` is `0 + dy`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, the `dist` array is updated to reflect the shortest path distances. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` remains 0, and the `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
