The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the current distance `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it indicates that this assignment is valid and updates the state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
