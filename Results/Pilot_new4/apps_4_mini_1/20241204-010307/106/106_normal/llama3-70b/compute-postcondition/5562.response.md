The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, we can analyze the impact of this code. 

Initially, we have:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `dx` is 1.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x + 1` (which is unknown).
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1` (which is unknown).
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (which is dependent on `A` and the values of `nx` and `ny`).
  
The line `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` means that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The specific values for `cur` and `ncur` are not provided, but we know they will have a specific value based on the context in which this code is executed.

Since `dist[1][cur]` is being used to update `dist[1][ncur]`, the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` will change, but we do not have the exact values of `cur` or `ncur`.

Therefore, the output state is that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `dx` is 1.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x + 1`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
