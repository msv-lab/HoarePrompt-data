According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. This means that the loop will execute four times in total, once for each tuple of `(dx, dy)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we consider the following:
- The loop has already been executed for the first three tuples. 
- If `dx` and `dy` have values assigned to them based on the last iteration, we need to determine the next values for the variables.

Since there have been three iterations already, the loop will execute one more time for the fourth tuple `(1, 1)`. 

Thus, to prepare for the next iteration:
- The values for `dx` and `dy` will be `1` and `1`, respectively.

No changes are needed for `N`, `y`, or `x`, as those do not influence the next iteration in the context of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 + dy`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
