The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. 

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `dx` is -1
- `y` is 1
- `dy` is 0

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = 2 + (-1) = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `ny = 1 + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1.**
