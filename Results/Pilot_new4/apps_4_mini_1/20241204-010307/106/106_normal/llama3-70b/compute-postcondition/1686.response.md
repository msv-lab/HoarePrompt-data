Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
