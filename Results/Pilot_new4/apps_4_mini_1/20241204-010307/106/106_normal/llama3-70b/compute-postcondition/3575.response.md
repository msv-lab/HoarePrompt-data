The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `dist[1][ncur]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` has been updated.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
