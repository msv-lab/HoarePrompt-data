The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged, but `dist[0][ncur]` is now one greater than that. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` are valid; `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N; `piece` is equal to 0; and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.
