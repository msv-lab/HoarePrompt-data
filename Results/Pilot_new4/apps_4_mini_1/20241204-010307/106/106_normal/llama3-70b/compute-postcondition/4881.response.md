The assignment updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` with the result of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which implies that the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and the condition on `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for any value in `dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for any value in `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
