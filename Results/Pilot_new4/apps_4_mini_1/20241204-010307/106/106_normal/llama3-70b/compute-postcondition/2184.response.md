Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `ncur` is the value of A[x + 1][y]. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
