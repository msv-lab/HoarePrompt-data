Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains the previous contents plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
