Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 5; `ny` is -1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[5][-1]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
