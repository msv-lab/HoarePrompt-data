Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` are updated for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves; the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`***
