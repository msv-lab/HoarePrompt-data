According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`, which will execute four timesâ€”once for each direction. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` would have been the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. 

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, `dx` and `dy` will take the next values in the list. Since the loop has already processed all four directions, it will start again from the first direction in the list.

Therefore, the next values for `dx` and `dy` will be `(-1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is `dx`, `y` is `dy`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
