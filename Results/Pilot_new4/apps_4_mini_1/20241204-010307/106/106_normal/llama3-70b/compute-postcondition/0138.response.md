The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial conditions indicate that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, but this does not directly affect the code executed, which only updates the `dist[1][ncur]` based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects the change in `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 â‰¤ `nx`, `ny` < `N; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
