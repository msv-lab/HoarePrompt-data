Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, and the value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`.***
