The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`, but since `ncur` is not specified further in the given context and `A` is not defined, we cannot determine its actual value. However, the `queue` variable will be updated by adding a new tuple.

All other states remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned values `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`.**
