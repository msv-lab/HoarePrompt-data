Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0. If `nx` is within the range [0, N) and `ny` is within the range [0, N), then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-2][0]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, no changes occur in the state of the program.***
