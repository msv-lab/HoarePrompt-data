The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given the initial state, `nx` is -2 and `ny` is 1. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. However, without the actual array `A`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`, but we know it is dependent on the index values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment without changing the other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-2][1]`.**
