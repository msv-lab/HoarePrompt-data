The line of code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`. The value assigned is a combination of `cur` and `piece`. The existing values of `cur` and `piece` were not specified, but they will impact the output state.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is within `0` and `N-1`
- `y` is within `0` and `N-1`
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is `y + 1`
- `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y + 1]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`

The code updates the `parent` array specifically at the index `[1][ncur]` with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The state of `parent[1][ncur]` changes, but we do not alter or know the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
