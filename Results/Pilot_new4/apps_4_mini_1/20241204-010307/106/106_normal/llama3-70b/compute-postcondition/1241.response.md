According to the code, the loop iterates over a set of direction pairs `(dx, dy)`. Since there are 8 pairs in the list, the loop will execute once for each pair. The variable `x` is currently 1, and `y` is currently 2. The loop is about to iterate for each `(dx, dy)`.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` are already established. Since there are 8 iterations total, after the last iteration of the loop (when `dx` and `dy` are the last pair), the next iteration would take the next pair which will not exist since all pairs are already used.

Therefore, we consider the end state of the loop. The loop will not execute again after processing all 8 pairs.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, and no further pairs exist to iterate over.**
