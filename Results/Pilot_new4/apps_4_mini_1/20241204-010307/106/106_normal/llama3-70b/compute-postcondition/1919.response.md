In the provided code, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined as `x - 1` and `y`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will now hold the value of `A[x - 1][y]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `N` is at least 4 (unchanged).
- `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices (unchanged).
- `piece` is equal to 2 (unchanged).
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1` (unchanged).
- `ny` is equal to `y` (unchanged).
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]` (changed).
- `dx` is -1 (unchanged).
- `dy` is 0 (unchanged).

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**.
