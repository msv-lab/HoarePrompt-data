The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `ncur` is defined based on the expression `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not modified by this line of code. 

The output state is therefore:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
