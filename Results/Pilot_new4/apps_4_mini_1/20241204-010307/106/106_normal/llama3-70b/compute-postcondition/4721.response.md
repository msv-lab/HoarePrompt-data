Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid positions based on the grid `A`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid state from `cur`, and `queue` contains tuples of all valid positions added during the iterations. The variable `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid positions were found, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.***
