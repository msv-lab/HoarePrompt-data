Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made.***
