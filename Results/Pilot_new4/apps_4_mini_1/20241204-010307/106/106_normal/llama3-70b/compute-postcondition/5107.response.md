Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `3 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
