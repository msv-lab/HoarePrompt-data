In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the values from the lists or arrays `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided in the initial state. 

1. `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, where `dx` is assumed to be a specific integer value that is valid in the context of the program.
2. `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, where `dy` is also assumed to be a specific integer value that is valid in the context of the program.

Since `y` is equal to `1`, we can note that `ny` will be calculated as `1 + dy`. However, without specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
