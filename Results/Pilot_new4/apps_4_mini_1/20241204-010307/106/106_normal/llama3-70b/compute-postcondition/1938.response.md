The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`, which indicates that `ncur` and the value `0` are now part of the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated output state retains all precondition information except for the addition of the new item to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now `cur`, `piece` is unchanged and remains 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
