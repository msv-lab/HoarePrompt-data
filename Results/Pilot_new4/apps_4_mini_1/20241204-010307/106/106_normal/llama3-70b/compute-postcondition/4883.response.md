The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are valid, and `piece` is currently set to `2`. Thus, the updated state reflects that the `queue` now includes a new position `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions and now also `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for any value in `dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for any value in `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `(cur, piece)`.**
