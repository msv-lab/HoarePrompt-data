Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N). If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `parent` or `queue`. If the condition 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N is not satisfied, no changes are made to `parent` or `queue`.***
