The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated to be one more than the value at `dist[0][cur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged after this operation, as they are not directly affected. 

Since `ncur` is derived from the values of `nx` and `ny`, its value is contingent on the bounds check of `A[nx][ny]`. We do not have specific values for `dist` or `cur`, but we will express the relationship.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 2`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (if it were in bounds); `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
