The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `ncur` and `cur` are previously defined in the context of the initial state. Here, `ncur` is determined by the combination of `dx` and `dy` added to constants, while `cur` is an existing variable that is referenced. The other variables remain unchanged.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the next pair of (dx, dy), `ncur` is equal to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, `queue` includes the next pair of (dx, dy), `ncur` is equal to `A[2 + dx][0 + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
