The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]`. The value assigned is the current value at `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. 

The variables `ncur` and `cur` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `ncur` is derived from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]` (where `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`). The values of `dist`, `cur`, and the contents of the array `A` will influence the output but are not provided in the initial state.

We know that:
- `N` is between 4 and 10,
- `x` is between 0 and `N-1`,
- `y` is between 1 and `N-1`,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`,
- `ncur` is equal to the value at `A[nx][ny]`.

The specific value for `dist[2][ncur]` increases by 1 from its previous value at `dist[2][cur]`. However, without initial values for `dist`, `cur`, and the contents of `A`, we can only describe the changes without numerical specifics.

The output state is:
- Variables `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged,
- The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is incremented based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
