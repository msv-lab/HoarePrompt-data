Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where the conditions are met, and `piece` remains unchanged. If the conditions were never met, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` would remain unchanged from their initial states.**
