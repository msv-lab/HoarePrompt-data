Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and if `piece` is equal to 2, then if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes occur to any variables.***
