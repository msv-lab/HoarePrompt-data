The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the element `parent[0][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur` and `piece`. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided, so we state that they are now assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
