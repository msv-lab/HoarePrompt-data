The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the value `2` to the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated `queue` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` is still 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1, queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
