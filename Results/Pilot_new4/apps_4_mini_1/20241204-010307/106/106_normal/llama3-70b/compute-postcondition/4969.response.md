The value of `ncur` is assigned to `ncur`, which represents a specific value derived from `A[nx][ny]`. The tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
