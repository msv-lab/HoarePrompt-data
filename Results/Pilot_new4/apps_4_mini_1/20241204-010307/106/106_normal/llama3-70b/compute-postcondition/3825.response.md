The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which represents the element in the 2D array `A` at the position defined by `nx` and `ny`. The precondition states that `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the grid, ensuring that they refer to a valid position in the array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
