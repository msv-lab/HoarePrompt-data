The code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged in the context provided, but `piece` is specified to be equal to 2 if certain conditions are met. The other variables' states remain the same, except for the `parent` variable, which gets updated to reflect the new assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` may include the next position accordingly.**
