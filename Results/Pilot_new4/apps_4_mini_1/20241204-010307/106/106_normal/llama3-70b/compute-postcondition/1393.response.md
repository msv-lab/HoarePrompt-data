In the given code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. 

Substituting the known values:
- `x` is 2
- `dx` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `dy` is 1

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = 2 + 0 = 2`
- `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`

The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
