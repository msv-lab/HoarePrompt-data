The value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is 2 and `ny` is 1, `ncur` is now equal to `A[2][1]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]**
