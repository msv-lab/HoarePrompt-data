Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent` reflects updated parent references for valid moves, `queue` contains at least one valid position, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `nx` is between 0 and N-1 inclusive, while `ny` is also between 0 and N-1 inclusive.***
