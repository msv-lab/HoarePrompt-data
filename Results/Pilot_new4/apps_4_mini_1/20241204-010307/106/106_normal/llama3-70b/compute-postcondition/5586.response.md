According to the code, the loop iterates over the possible directions given by `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each direction in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`,
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Since the loop iterates over four directions, and because the last direction processed will determine the next state, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. 

Given that `(dx, dy)` will change for each iteration:
- The first iteration processes `(-1, 0)`,
- The second iteration processes `(1, 0)`,
- The third iteration processes `(0, -1)`,
- The fourth iteration processes `(0, 1)`.

Assuming the loop has processed three directions and is now on the last one, the next `dx` and `dy` values will be `(0, 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure the current state reflects that the fourth direction is being processed. Therefore:
- `nx` would be calculated as `x + 0`,
- `ny` would be calculated as `y + 1`,
- `ncur` would then be updated based on the value in `A[nx][ny]`.

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that the loop is preparing to execute for the last direction.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`**
