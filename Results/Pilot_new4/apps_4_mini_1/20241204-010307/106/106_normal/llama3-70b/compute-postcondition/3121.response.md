Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur` that was reached, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` pairs added during the iterations. If no valid pairs were found, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
