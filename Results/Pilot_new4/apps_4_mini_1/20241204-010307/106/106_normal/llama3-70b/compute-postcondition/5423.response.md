Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` (where `ncur` is `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`) is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur and piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
