Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to reflect the minimum distance for each position reachable by the piece if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` holds the last position and the piece before reaching `ncur`; `queue` contains all the tuples of reachable positions and the piece number. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, with `dist[0][cur]` unchanged for any unreachable positions.**
