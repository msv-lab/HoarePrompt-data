The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values of `y` is equal to `N`, and `N` is an integer between 3 and 10. The values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified, so we can't determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we know their relationships to `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
