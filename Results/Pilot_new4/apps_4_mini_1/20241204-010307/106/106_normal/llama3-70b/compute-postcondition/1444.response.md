The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are as follows: `x` is 2, `dx` is 1, `y` is 1, and `dy` is -1. 

Calculating `nx`:
- `nx = x + dx = 2 + 1 = 3`

Calculating `ny`:
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0`

Now we update only the values of the variables that have changed:
- `nx` is now 3
- `ny` is now 0

The other variables retain their values:
- `N` is still between 3 and 10
- `x` is still 2
- `y` is still 1
- `dx` is still 1
- `dy` is still -1

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1**
