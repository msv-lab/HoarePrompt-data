According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which contains four directions. The loop will execute for each of these tuples. At the end of the last iteration, the loop would have executed for the first tuple, and the next iteration will utilize the second tuple in the list.

Since the list has four tuples to iterate through, the first iteration would have processed the tuple `(-1, 0)`, and for the loop to execute again, it would now process the second tuple `(1, 0)`. 

The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, and `piece` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the execution of the loop body. The loop will continue to execute until all tuples in the list have been used.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `piece` is 2, dx is 1, dy is 0**
