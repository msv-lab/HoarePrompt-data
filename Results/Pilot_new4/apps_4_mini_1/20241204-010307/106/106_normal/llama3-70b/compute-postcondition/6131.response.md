To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the pairs in the list. The values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not explicitly provided in the initial state.

The code line `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` results in the following:
- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Since `y` is 1, `ny` will equal `1 + dy`.

We know that `dx` and `dy` will take values from the pairs in the list. However, without specific values for `x`, `dx`, and `dy`, we cannot calculate exact numerical values for `nx` and `ny`. Instead, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of the unknowns.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship of the variables after execution:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
