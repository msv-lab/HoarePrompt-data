Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf'), `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `queue` is empty, `y` is 0, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` (which is 1). The current values are `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 0, and the condition `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` holds true.***
