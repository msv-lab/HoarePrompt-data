Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, if `nx` is within the bounds of `0` to `N - 1` and `ny` is within the bounds of `0` to `N - 1`, then `piece` is equal to 1. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the `queue` contains the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, while the values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not met, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
