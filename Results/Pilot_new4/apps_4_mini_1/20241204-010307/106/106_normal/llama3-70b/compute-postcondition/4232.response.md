Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is -1, `ny` is `N - 2`, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][N - 2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
