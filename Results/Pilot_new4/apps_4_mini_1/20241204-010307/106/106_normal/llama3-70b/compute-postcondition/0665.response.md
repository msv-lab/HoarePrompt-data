To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current states and how the loop modifies them.

Given the current state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is 2

The loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`, which will adjust the values of `dx` and `dy` in each iteration. 

1. In the first iteration, `dx` will be -1 and `dy` will be -1.
2. In the second iteration, `dx` will be -1 and `dy` will be 1.
3. In the third iteration, `dx` will be 1 and `dy` will be -1.
4. In the fourth iteration, `dx` will be 1 and `dy` will be 1.

We need to consider the changes to `nx` and `ny` for each of these iterations, which are calculated as:

- `nx = x + dx`
- `ny = y + dy`

Now, letâ€™s analyze the final state after the last iteration of the loop:

In the last iteration when `dx = 1` and `dy = 1`:
- `nx = x + 1`
- `ny = y + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`

For the loop to execute again, we need to use the first tuple from the list again: `(-1, -1)` when `dx = -1` and `dy = -1`. This would make:
- `nx = x - 1`
- `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`

Before the loop can execute one more time, we must ensure that `nx` and `ny` remain within the bounds of `0` and `N`.

Thus, we conclude:
- `dx` and `dy` will be set to the values of the first element in the next iteration.
- `nx` will be `x - 1` (which must be within bounds).
- `ny` will be `0`.

Therefore, the required state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0**
