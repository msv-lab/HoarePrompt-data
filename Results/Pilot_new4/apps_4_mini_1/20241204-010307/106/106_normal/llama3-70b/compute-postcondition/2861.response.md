According to the code, the loop executes over the tuples in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which are directional deltas. The loop will execute regardless of the states of `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` since these values do not affect the execution of the loop itself. The loop will iterate four times, once for each tuple.

However, for the loop to be meaningful in the context of the program, it needs to be ensured that there are reachable positions represented in `queue` that can be processed during the loop's execution. 

Given that `piece` is currently equal to `1`, this condition is satisfied. There is no mention of any updates that need to be made to `dist[1]` or `parent[1]`, but for the loop to execute and use valid data, it can be considered that `queue` should not be empty.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute meaningfully are:
- `piece` remains `1` (valid).
- `queue` must not be empty to ensure there are positions to process in the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 1, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates predecessors for reachable positions, `dist[1]` holds shortest distances for positions reachable with piece value 1, `parent[1]` indicates predecessors for those positions, `queue` must not be empty**
