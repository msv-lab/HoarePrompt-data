Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`; `parent[0][ncur]` contains updated parent positions; `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` and now has an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1 for the last iteration; `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
