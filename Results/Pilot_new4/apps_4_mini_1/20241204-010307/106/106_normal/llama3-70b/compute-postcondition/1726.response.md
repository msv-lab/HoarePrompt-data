Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated for valid combinations of `dx` and `dy`, `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect the last valid `cur` and `piece`, `queue` will contain all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` appended during the iterations. The current value of `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`.***
