Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
