Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the minimum distances updated based on valid moves from the initial state, `parent[1]` contains the connections made for valid moves, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and if `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, the existing values remain unchanged.***
