In the code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not given in the initial state, which means the exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined.

From the initial state:
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 2
- `nx` can be 3, 4, or 5
- `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3

Since `nx` is calculated as `4 + dx` and `ny` as `2 + dy`, the possible values for `nx` and `ny` can be derived:
- For `nx`: 
  - If `dx` is -1, then `nx` = 4 - 1 = 3
  - If `dx` is 0, then `nx` = 4 + 0 = 4
  - If `dx` is +1, then `nx` = 4 + 1 = 5

- For `ny`:
  - If `dy` is -1, then `ny` = 2 - 1 = 1
  - If `dy` is 0, then `ny` = 2 + 0 = 2
  - If `dy` is +1, then `ny` = 2 + 1 = 3

Thus, the output state is:
`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 4, or 5; `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3. The new values of `nx` and `ny` are dependent on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx` where `dx` can be -1, 0, or 1; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy` where `dy` can be -1, 0, or 1.**
