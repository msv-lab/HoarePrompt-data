Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `piece` is the same. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the variables.***
