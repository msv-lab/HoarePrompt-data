The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Given the preconditions, this means that the value at `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the current value at `dist[0][cur]`. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is being set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, it implies that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` will now be one greater than the current value of `dist[0][cur]`, following the condition that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 0, and now `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, keeping `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`.**
