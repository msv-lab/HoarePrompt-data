Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for all reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` remains 2, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` entries generated during the iterations. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
