Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, both `nx` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive) and `ny` is between 0 and N-1 (inclusive). If the value of `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
