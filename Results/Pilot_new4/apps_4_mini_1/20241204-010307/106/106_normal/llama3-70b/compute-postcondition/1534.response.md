The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions still hold after this operation. Since `ncur` is previously defined as `A[1][1]`, `queue` will now contain additional information of this state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0 and now also includes `(ncur, 1)`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
