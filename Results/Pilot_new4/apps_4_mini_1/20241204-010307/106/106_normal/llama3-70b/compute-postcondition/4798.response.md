Postcondition: ***If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now contains one additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` becomes greater than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`. If `piece` is not 2 or the condition does not hold, there are no changes to the state.***
