The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, which is based on the variables `cur` and `piece`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, the distance from the start to `ncur` is equal to the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1, parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
