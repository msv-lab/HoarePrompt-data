The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is computed as `x + dx`, which equals `2 + 0 = 2`, and `ny` is computed as `y + dy`, which equals `2 + 1 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. We also check the conditions for `ncur`, but `ny` (which is 3) exceeds the upper limit (N can be at most 10 based on the initial state), so `ncur` will not be updated and remains undefined. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` remains unchanged if it was previously defined.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` remains unchanged if it was previously defined.**
