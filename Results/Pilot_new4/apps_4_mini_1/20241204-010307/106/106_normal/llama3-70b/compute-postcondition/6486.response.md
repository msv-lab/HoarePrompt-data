The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]` array at the index `ncur`. The initial state indicates `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is a value derived from `x` and `y`. Other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state updates only the `parent[0][ncur]` variable.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` with `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
