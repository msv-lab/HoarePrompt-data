According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directions defined by the pairs `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, variables `x` and `y` have values `0` and `1`, respectively. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `dx` and `dy` as `nx = dx` and `ny = 1 + dy`.

In the last iteration, since `nx` is determined by `dx`, we must consider the next direction pair. Starting from `(-1, 0)`, it will move to `(1, 0)`, then to `(0, -1)`, and finally `(0, 1)`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will be `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, or `(0, 1)` sequentially. The first case to check after the last pair is `(0, -1)`, which means `nx` will be `0` and `ny` will be `0`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states such that:
- The loop has executed for all four direction pairs.
- If the loop executes again using the next direction pair, `nx` will be `0` and `ny` will be `0`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[0][0]`, `piece` is equal to 2**
