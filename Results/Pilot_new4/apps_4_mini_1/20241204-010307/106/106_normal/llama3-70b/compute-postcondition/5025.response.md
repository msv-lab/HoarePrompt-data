The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current position `(x, y)` and the changes specified by `dx` and `dy`. Since the exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we can consider them as offsets that can change `x` and `y` respectively.

So, `nx` becomes `3 + dx` and `ny` becomes `0 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent` corresponds to those reachable positions, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy**
