The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` attempts to assign the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the value at `parent[2][ncur]`. However, the variable `cur` is undefined in the provided initial state. Therefore, no changes can be made to `parent[2][ncur]`, and the values of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, and we cannot update `parent[2][ncur]` due to the undefined variable `cur`.**
