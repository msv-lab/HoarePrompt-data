The code assigns the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are dependent on the initial conditions but are not explicitly defined in the initial state provided. The other variables remain unchanged, but we note the update to `parent[2][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
