According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. For the loop to execute again, it needs to proceed to the next tuple from the list. Since there are 4 tuples, the loop will iterate through them using an index.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is that `piece` is 0, and the loop has not yet started processing the first tuple. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to know which tuple it will process next. 

Given that no tuple has been processed yet, we can assume the loop will start with the first tuple `(-1, -1)` in the next iteration. The index for the iteration can be tracked, and if we consider that for each loop iteration, we will move to the next tuple, we can set the state for the next iteration accordingly.

State: **`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
