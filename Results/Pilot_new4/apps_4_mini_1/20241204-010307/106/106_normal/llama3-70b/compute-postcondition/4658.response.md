According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration of the loop corresponds to one pair of values from this list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, 
- the values of `dx` and `dy` are `-2` and `1`, respectively.

Since the loop iterates over the list of pairs `((-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1))`, we need to determine the next pair of `(dx, dy)` that will be executed in the next iteration. After the current values `(-2, 1)`, the next pair in the list will be `(-1, -2)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect these changes.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` is appended with the element `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not met, no actions are performed.**
