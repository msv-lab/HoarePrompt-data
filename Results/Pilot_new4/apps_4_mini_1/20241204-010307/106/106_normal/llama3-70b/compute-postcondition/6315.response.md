The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. `ncur` is derived from the initial state as `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is already 0. The variable `queue` is now modified to include a new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
