Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
