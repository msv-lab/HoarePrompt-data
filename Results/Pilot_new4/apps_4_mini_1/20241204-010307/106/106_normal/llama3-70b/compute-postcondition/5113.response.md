The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `3 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, which means they are valid indices for the 2D array `A`. The specific value of `ncur` depends on the values in the array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 0, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
