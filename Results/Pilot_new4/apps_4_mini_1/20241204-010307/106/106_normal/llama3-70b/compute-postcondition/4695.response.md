In this code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but `y` is known to be 2. The values of `dx` and `dy` are also not provided, so we will denote them as they are.

The output state will include the updated values for `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the other variables unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is defined and valid, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can be updated based on prior conditions, `queue` is properly populated with positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
