The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the value `0` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is currently not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it represents a valid index or value. The other variables are unaffected by this operation.

Since the only change is the addition of an element to the `queue`, we will include that in the output state while maintaining the existing conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is -1; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
