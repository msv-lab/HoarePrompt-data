Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves and `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the queue now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
