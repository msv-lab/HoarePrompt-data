The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `dx` is -1, which means `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`. The value of `dy` is 1, so `ny` will be equal to `y + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Since `y` is initially 0, `ny` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. Therefore, `ny` is 1. The value of `nx` will depend on the current value of `x`. 

The output state is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1.**
