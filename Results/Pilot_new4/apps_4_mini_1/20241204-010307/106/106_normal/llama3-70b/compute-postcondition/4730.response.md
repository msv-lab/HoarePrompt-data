The code assigns a new value to the variable `queue`. The `deque` is initialized with a tuple containing the value `1` and the current value of `i`, which is `3`. Therefore, `queue` will now hold a single element, the tuple `(1, 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on piece types, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, `cur` is the value of the last processed piece, `piece` indicates the type of the last processed piece, `i` is 3, `dist[3][1]` is 0, `queue` is deque([(1, 3)])**
