According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `N`. The loop continues as long as `x` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `N` is between 3 and 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `x` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than `2`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `dist` contains updated distances for all valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 2)` based on the respective `piece` values; `parent` contains predecessors for all valid positions reachable from these coordinates; `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions updated during the iterations, plus any additional tuples of the form `(cur, i)` for each `piece` that was not equal to `i`.**
