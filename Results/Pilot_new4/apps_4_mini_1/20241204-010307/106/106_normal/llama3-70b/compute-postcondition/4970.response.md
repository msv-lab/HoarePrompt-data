Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 2; if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
