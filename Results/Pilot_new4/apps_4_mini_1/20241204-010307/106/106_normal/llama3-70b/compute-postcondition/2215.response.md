The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state includes the information about `ncur` and the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains three elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0), (ncur, 0)]`, `nx` is now `x + dx`, `ny` is now `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, piece is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, now processing the second pair `(-2, 1)`**.
