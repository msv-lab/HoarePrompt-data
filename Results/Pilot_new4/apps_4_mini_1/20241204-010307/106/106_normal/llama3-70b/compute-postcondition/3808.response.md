The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The value is computed by taking the current value of `dist[1][cur]` and adding 1 to it. The variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist` are not specifically defined in the initial state, but we know that `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`.

Given that `nx` is calculated as `2 + dx` and `ny` as `1 + dy`, the specific value of `ncur` depends on the values of `dx` and `dy` and the array `A`. 

The values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` will be updated, but since we lack information about `cur` and the current values in `dist`, we can only state that `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state remains with updated information about the effect of the operation:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
