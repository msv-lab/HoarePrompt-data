The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which equals `2 + 1 = 3`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which equals `0 + (-2) = -2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -2**
