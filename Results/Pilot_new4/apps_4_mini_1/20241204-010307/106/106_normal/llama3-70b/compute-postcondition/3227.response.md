The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` is not relevant as it is being updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

`dist[2][cur]` is used to calculate the new value, which is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but we do know that `N` is still constrained by the conditions given (`3 <= N <= 10`), and that the `dist` and `parent` matrices, along with the `queue`, are still established as described before the code execution. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`.**
