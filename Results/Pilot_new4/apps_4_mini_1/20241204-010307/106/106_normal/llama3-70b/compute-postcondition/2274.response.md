The code `queue.append((cur, i))` appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. The state of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `piece`) remains unchanged because the code only affects the `queue`. Since `piece` is confirmed to be either 1 or 2 and its specific value does not influence the operation of appending to `queue`, and it is also specified that the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, we don't have any further constraints on the values being appended.

Therefore, the Output State is: `piece` is 1 or 2, `dist[2]` contains the shortest path distances from `cur` for `piece` 2, `parent[2]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices with `piece` 2, and now `queue` includes `(cur, i)` as an additional element.

Output State: **`piece` is 1 or 2, `dist[2]` contains the shortest path distances from `cur` for `piece` 2, `parent[2]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices with `piece` 2, `queue` includes `(cur, i)` as an additional element.**
