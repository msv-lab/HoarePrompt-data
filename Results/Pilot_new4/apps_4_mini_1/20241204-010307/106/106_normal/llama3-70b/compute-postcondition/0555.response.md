The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 2][1]` and the other variables involved in this operation are `dist`, `cur`, and the value of `dist[0][cur]` is determined by the current state of `dist`.

While executing the code, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, but we have no direct information about `cur` or the values in `dist`. However, we know the following:
- `N` remains within the range `[3, 10]`.
- `y` stays equal to `0`.
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`.
- `nx` is computed as `x - 2`.
- `ny` is `1`.
- `ncur` is determined by accessing the array `A` at index `x - 2` and column `1`.

After the operation:
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The output state reflects all unchanged variables while indicating that `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is `x - 2`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
