The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` can take on multiple pairs of values: `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, `(0, 1)`. Therefore, the resulting values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific current values of `x` and `y` combined with the chosen `dx` and `dy`.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10 and the values of `y` are initialized to 0, values of `dist` and `parent` are not changed, and `queue` remains unchanged, the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current `x` and `y`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy` where `dx` and `dy` are one of the pairs (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1).**
