According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the defined tuples of `(dx, dy)` which are `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the first tuple. Since the loop is structured to take one tuple at a time, the next iteration will move on to the second tuple in the list.

There are no changes needed to the state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, and `dist` because they do not inherently change unless modified by the loop body. The values of `dx` and `dy` will change according to the next pair in the iterable.

At the end of the last iteration, we assume that the loop has been executed for `(-1, 0)`. For the loop to execute one more time, it will now process the second tuple, which is `(1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
