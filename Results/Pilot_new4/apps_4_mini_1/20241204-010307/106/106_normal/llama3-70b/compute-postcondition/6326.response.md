According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing directional changes `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `y` is 0, which means that the last directional change handled was the one associated with the last tuple in the list. 

The loop processes each tuple in the list in sequential order. Given that the list has 8 tuples, the next iteration will move to the next tuple in the list after the current one. Since `dx` and `dy` are the first elements of the tuples, the next values will correspond to the next tuple in the list, which is `(2, 1)`.

To adjust for the next iteration:
- The current tuple would be processed, so we need to specify that `dx` and `dy` will now be equal to the next tuple's values.
- The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not modified in this loop.

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time will reflect the next tuple in the iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to 2, `ny` is equal to 1, `piece` is equal to 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met.**
