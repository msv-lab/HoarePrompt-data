The code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this condition implies that the assignment will make `dist[1][ncur]` smaller than its previous value. 

Now we can summarize the impact:
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` (new value is updated).**
