`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`. The initial values of `x` and `y` (1 and 2, respectively) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
