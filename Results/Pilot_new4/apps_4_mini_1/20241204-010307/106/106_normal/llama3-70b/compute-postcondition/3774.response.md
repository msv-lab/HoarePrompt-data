The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the given initial state, but they will be assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, and `dist` remain unchanged in this context as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
