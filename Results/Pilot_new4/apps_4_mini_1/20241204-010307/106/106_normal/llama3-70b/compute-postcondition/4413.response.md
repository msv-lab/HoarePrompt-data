The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and `1` remains constant. The state of other variables remains unchanged, but the `queue` now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, `queue` now contains an additional position `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
