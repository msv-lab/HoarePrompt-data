Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains path information for valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where `piece` is 1. If no valid moves exist, then `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged, and `queue` remains empty.**
