The line of code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. Since `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, their specific values are unknown. However, the state of `parent[0][ncur]` will now reflect the combination of these two variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
