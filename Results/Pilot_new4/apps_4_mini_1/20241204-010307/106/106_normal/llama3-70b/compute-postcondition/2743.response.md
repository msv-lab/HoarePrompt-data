The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values do not affect other variables, so we keep the original states. The variables that are specified remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is the current y-coordinate; `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
