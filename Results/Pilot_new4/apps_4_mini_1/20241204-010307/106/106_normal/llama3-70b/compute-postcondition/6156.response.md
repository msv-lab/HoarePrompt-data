To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over a fixed set of directions represented by the pairs `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. This means there will always be 8 iterations of the loop, regardless of the values of `N` and `y`.

2. The values for `nx` and `ny` will change based on the current values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, `ny` starts at 1, and changes according to `dy` from the direction pairs. Depending on the value of `x`, `nx` will also change based on `dx`.

3. The conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` will determine whether `ncur` is updated, and whether the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, `queue`) are modified. If either condition is not satisfied, no updates for that iteration occur.

4. The final state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will depend on how many of the iterations successfully update them based on the conditions provided in the loop.

Given this understanding, here is the output state after all iterations of the loop:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` contains the distance values for reachable cells, `parent[0]` indicates the parents of these cells if reachable, `queue` contains tuples of reachable cells and their associated pieces, and `nx`, `ny` have taken on values based on all direction pairs from the loop for given `x` and `y`.**
