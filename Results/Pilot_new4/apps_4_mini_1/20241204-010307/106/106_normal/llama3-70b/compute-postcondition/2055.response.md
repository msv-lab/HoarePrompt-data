The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` and `dy` have been reset to (-1, -1), this means `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` becomes `y - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1.**
