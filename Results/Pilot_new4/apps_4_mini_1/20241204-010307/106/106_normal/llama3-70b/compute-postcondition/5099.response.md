Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is A[3 + dx][1 + dy]. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated with (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the new element `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
