The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[2][3]`, but its specific value is not given. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the assignment made in the code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][3]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
