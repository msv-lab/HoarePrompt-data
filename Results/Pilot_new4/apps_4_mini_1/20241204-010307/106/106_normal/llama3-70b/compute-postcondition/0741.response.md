Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 + dy`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the predecessor positions in the path, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the position `(ncur, 1)`, provided that `piece` equals 1 and the previous `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. If the conditions are not met, the state remains unchanged.***
