The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The states of the other variables are unaffected.

Given the initial state includes that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and all other stated conditions remain valid, there are no changes to those variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1, parent[0][ncur] is set to (cur, piece)**.
