According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable consisting of the tuples that represent the directional changes `dx` and `dy`. Since this iterable has 4 elements, the loop can execute a total of 4 times, iterating through each direction. At the end of the last iteration, we have only executed the loop 1 time (as `y` is still 0, indicating we are likely in the first iteration). 

Given that the loop starts from the first tuple `(-1, -1)` and progresses through the list, our current `dx` and `dy` correspond to the first tuple in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, we would move to the second tuple, which is `(-1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + (-1)`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If these conditions are satisfied, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
