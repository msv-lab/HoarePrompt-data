According to the code, the loop iterates over a set of directional changes defined by the pairs `(dx, dy)`. Since the loop is set to iterate over the four pairs `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`, it will execute once for each pair.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2. The loop will execute again, moving to the next element in the list of direction pairs. After the last iteration, the current `dx` and `dy` are the first pair, which means the next pair would be `(-1, 1)`, as it follows the order of the given list.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted to reflect the next values of `dx` and `dy`. There are no additional constraints provided for the loop to execute again, and since there are four pairs, we can confirm that the loop will execute successfully.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1**
