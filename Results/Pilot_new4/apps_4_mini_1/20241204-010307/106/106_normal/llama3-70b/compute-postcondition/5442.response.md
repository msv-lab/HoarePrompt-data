The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `4 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that both `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on `dx` and `dy`, and they are ensured to be between `0` and `N-1`. However, the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, and thus the exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined without additional information. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
