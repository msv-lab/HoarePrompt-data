Output State: **`dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated distances for valid `ncur` indices if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `(cur, piece)` pair for those `ncur`; `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 2)` appended during the iterations; `queue` now additionally includes the tuple `(cur, i)`**.
