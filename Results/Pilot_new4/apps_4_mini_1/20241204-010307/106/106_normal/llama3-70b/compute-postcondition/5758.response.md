According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which means it will execute four times, once for each tuple. The variables `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the respective values in the tuples during each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, which means `nx` and `ny` must lie within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple in the sequence. After the last iteration, if we have completed the iterations for the first four tuples, the next loop will again start from the first tuple, `(-1, 0)`, indicating that if there were no prior constraints, the loop could potentially execute again from the beginning.

However, since the loop is iterating over a fixed list of tuples, the next value of `(dx, dy)` will wrap back to the first element after completing the four iterations. Therefore, for the next iteration, we need to reset to the first tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**
