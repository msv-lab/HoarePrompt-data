To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

**Initial State:**
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is updated to `2 + dx`
- `ny` is updated to `1 + dy`

The code snippet is:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the addition of `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively.
2. After the updates, `nx` becomes `2 + dx` and `ny` becomes `1 + dy`.
3. The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`.

**Output State:**
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is `2 + dx`
- `ny` is `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` (which is the value retrieved from the array `A` at indices `2 + dx` and `1 + dy`)

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
