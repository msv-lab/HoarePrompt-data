The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The variable `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1. Therefore, `nx` becomes `x + (-2)` which simplifies to `x - 2`, and `ny` becomes `1 + 1` which simplifies to `2`. 

The preconditions for `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain valid, with `nx` now explicitly recalculated as `x - 2` and `ny` updated to `2`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2**
