The line `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple of values `cur` and `piece` to the location `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `parent` will now have a new value at the index `[2][ncur]`, but the rest of the variables remain unchanged in terms of their values. Thus, the output state will reflect that the `parent` array has been modified at the specified index. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` remains unchanged, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (`cur`, `piece`).**
