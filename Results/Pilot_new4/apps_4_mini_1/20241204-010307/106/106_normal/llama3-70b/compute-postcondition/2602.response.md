Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
