To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop structure and the current state provided.

1. The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 elements.
2. In the previous iteration, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0. This indicates that the loop has executed once.
3. After executing the loop body for the values `(-1, 0)`, the next iteration will occur with the next tuple in the list.

The iterations of the loop occur as follows:
- First iteration: `dx = -1`, `dy = 0`
- Second iteration: `dx = 1`, `dy = 0`
- Third iteration: `dx = 0`, `dy = -1`
- Fourth iteration: `dx = 0`, `dy = 1`

Since `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to the next tuple, we can conclude that after the iteration with `(-1, 0)`, the next values will be `(1, 0)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the states need to reflect the next tuple in the list:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y`**
