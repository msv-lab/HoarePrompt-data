Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist` is initialized, `parent` is initialized, `queue` can potentially be empty or initialized, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
