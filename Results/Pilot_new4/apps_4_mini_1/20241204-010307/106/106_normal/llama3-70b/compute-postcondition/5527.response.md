The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`. Specifically, `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given the preconditions, `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, meaning that after the assignment, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and that will violate the previous relationship.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range from 0 to N-1, the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `piece` is equal to 0.**
