The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to the value at `dist[2][cur]` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we need to consider that `dist[2][ncur]` is now updated based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`.

The output state will reflect the updated value for `dist[2][ncur]` based on the previous values, while all other variables remain as is.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, and `queue` contains reachable positions.**
