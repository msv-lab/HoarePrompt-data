The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged. The state of `parent[0][ncur]` is now defined.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
