The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the displacement values `dx` and `dy`. 

The initial state indicates that `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they are assumed to be known and valid for the context.

After executing the code:
- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `0 + dx`, thus `nx = dx`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `1 + dy`, thus `ny = 1 + dy`.

The values of `N`, `queue`, and other variables remain unchanged in this execution since the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**.
