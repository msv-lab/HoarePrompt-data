Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` remains unchanged. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
