Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy 0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`. The value of `piece` is 2 and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
