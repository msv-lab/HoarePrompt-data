The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, the new value being assigned to `dist[2][ncur]` is based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`, which is not defined in the initial state.

The other variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State remains:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `dx` is 0
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is 0
- `ny` is 1
- `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`
- `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, but the specific value cannot be determined without the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
