The code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to the array `parent` at the index `[2][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state but are now recorded in the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
