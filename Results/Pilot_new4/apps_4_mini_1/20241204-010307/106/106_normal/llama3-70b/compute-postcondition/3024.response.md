The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added as a new element to the list `queue`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `queue` has been updated with the new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][1 + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
