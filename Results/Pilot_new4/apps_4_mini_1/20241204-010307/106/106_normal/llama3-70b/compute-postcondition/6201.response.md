Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, there is no change to the state.***
