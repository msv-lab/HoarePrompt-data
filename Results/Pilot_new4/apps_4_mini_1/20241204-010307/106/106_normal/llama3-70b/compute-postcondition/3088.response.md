The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `nx = x - 2` and `ny = 1`. The specific values for `nx` depend on the value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. The initial state for `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `ny`, and `nx` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code.

Since `ny` is given as 1, and `nx` is defined in terms of `x`, we can say `ncur` is indexed from the array `A` at position `[x - 2][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; ncur = A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
