The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the existing values of `x` and `y`, with `dx` and `dy` being added to them respectively. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. We know that `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, and `dy` is -1, so we can calculate `ny` as follows:

- `ny = y + dy = 2 + (-1) = 1`

For `nx`, since `x` is not defined, we can't determine its exact value. Thus, `nx` is defined in terms of `x`:

- `nx = x + dx = x - 2`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1**
