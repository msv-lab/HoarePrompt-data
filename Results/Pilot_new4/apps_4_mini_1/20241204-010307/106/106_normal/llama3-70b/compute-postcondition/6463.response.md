The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This modifies the `queue` variable while leaving all other variables unchanged. The value of `ncur` remains the same, and the existing conditions about `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` still hold true. Since `queue` is updated to contain one additional tuple, we summarize the relevant changes in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur, piece`, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`**.
