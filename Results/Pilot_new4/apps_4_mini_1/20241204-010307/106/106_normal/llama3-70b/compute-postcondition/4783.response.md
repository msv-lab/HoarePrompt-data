The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` remain equal to `dx` and `dy` respectively, but the specific values of `nx` and `ny` are not provided. The variable `N` remains between 3 and 10, and the values of `x` and `y` are still 0. Therefore, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
