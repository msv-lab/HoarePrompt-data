The expression `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[1][cur] + 1`. In this case, `dist[1][ncur]` gets updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`, which remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` are not affected, and the updated `dist` and `parent` are only applicable if they were previously defined. The value of `ncur` comes from the position in the array `A` based on `nx` and `ny`, and thus it is directly associated with the computations involving `dist`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0 or 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist`, `parent` are updated if applicable.**
