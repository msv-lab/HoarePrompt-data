`nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-2)`, resulting in `nx` being `-2`. Likewise, `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which is `1 + 1`, resulting in `ny` being `2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 2.**
