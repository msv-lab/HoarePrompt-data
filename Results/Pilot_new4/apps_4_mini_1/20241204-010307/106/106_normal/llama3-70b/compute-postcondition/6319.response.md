The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `x` is 0 and `y` is 0. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `nx` will be equal to `0 + dx`, and `ny` will be equal to `0 + dy`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met.**
