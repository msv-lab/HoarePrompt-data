Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` now contains valid positions including two instances of (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x][N + 1]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`. The `queue` is updated to contain valid positions including (ncur, 2). Otherwise, the state remains unchanged since there is no else part.***
