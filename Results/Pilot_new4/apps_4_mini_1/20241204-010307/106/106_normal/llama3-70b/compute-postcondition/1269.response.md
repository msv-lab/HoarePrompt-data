The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `y`, and the next direction tuple `(-1, 1)`. Here, `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `1`, which will be used to compute `nx` and `ny`.

Given:
- `x` is `1`
- `y` is `2`
- `dx` is `-1`
- `dy` is `1`

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + 1 = 3`

The values of `N`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3**.
