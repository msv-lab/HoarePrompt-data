The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged, and the other variables in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each `dx, dy` in the list; `piece` is 0; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains a tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
