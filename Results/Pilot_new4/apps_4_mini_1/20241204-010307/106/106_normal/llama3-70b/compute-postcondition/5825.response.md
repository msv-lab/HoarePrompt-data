The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. The variable `queue` now contains one additional tuple compared to its previous state. The value of `ncur` is not specified, but it is part of the tuple being added.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` now contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
