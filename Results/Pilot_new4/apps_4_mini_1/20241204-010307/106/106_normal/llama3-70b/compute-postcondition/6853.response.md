The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the second element of the tuple (which is `0`) will be added to `queue`, while other variables remain unchanged. 

The initial state, which includes `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, and `piece`, remains valid. 

Since `queue` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an existing list that will now contain an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
