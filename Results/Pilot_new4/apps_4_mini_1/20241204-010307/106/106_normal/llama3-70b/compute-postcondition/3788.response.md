The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined as `2 + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, the values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
