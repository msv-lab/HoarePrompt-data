The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]` and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. This indicates that `parent[1][ncur]` is now a tuple or structure holding both `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple (cur, piece).**
