The variable `ncur` is assigned a value from the 2D array `A` using the index `nx`, which is equal to `x - 1`. The value of `cur` is not given, but `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. This means that the value at the index `[2][ncur]` in the `dist` array will change based on the current value of `dist[2][cur]` plus one. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][0]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
