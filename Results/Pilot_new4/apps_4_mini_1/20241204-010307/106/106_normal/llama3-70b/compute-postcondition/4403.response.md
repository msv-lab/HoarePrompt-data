Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no updates are made.***
