Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` still reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position to all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[2][ncur]` continues to store the previous position and piece type for all reachable `ncur` values, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` in addition to the existing tuples. If no valid moves exist, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
