The `parent` array at position `[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but the values of `parent[0][ncur]` are now explicitly referenced.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), `piece` equals 0, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned value of `cur` and `piece`.**
