The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `1` and `0`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[1][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`.**
