Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, if both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N-1` (inclusive), then `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `dist[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, `parent[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, `queue` contains tuples of valid moves including the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
