The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`, calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The previous values of `dx` and `dy` are -1 and -2. Therefore:

- `nx` will be `x - 1`
- `ny` will be `2 + (-2)`, which equals `0`

The other variables `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected as they are not altered by this computation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` if conditions are met; `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` if conditions are met; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if conditions are met.**
