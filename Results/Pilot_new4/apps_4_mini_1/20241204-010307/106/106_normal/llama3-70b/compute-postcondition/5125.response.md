The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the end of the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` will be used directly in this operation. The variable `ncur` is already assigned the value of `A[2][0]`, and the value of `1` is constant. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, 1)`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][0]`.**
