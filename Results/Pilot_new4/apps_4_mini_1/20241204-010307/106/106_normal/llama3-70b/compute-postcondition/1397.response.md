The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are being added, but the state of other relevant variables remains unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is already defined as `A[2][1]` based on the initial state, and `2` is a constant, there are no additional calculations to perform on these variables. The output state reflects that `ncur` is still equal to `A[2][1]`, and a new tuple has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and (ncur, 2) has been added to `queue`.**
