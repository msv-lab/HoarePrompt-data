The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur` means that the value of `cur` is assigned to the `parent` matrix at the specified indices. Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]` and `cur` is a valid index, the state of the `parent` variable will now reflect this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `1`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
