The code `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the existing value of `dist[1][cur]`. Since `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, after the assignment, `dist[1][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` 
- `dist[1][cur]` is unchanged

All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `queue` contains all relevant tuples of reachable positions with piece value `0`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, satisfying `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
