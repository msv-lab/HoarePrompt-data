The variables `x` and `y` are updated based on the direction given by `dx` and `dy`. The new values for `nx` and `ny` are calculated by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The values of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`.**
