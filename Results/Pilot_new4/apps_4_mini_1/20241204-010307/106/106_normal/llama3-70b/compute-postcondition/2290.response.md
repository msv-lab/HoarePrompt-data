The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `N + dy`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]**.
