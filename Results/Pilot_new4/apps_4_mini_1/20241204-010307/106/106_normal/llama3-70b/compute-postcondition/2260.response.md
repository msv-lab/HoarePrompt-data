The operation assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`, where `ncur` is defined as `A[x + 1][y]` and `piece` remains unchanged. The other values (`piece`, `(dx, dy)`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, etc.) are not affected since they are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values and the newly assigned value for `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`.**
