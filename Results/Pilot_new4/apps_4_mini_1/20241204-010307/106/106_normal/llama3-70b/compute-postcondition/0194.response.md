According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples, and since there are 8 tuples, the loop will execute 8 times in total.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1.
- The next iteration will take the next tuple from the list: `(-2, 1)`.

Therefore, the next values for `dx` and `dy` will be:
- `dx` will be -2
- `dy` will be 1

Since we are in the middle of iterating, there are no additional constraints or conditions that affect the ability to continue executing the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as there are tuples left in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `N - 1`.**
