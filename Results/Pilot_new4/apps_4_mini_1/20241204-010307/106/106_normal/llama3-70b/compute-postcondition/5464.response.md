The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `1` are being added to `queue`, but no other variables are affected or changed. The previous states of the other variables remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `(nx, ny)` are valid indices, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
