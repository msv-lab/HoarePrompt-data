According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements (`(dx, dy)` pairs). For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that it will iterate through each of the directional movements in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the `dx` and `dy` values were the values from the previous tuple in the list. The loop will proceed to the next pair in the list during the next iteration. Since the loop iterates over a list of 8 directional movements, after the last iteration with the last tuple `(2, 1)`, the next pair would have already been exhausted.

Thus, to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we would keep the current values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and also keep `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` unchanged because those values will not change until we start processing a new tuple pair. 

Since the last tuple `(2, 1)` is the last in the list, we now have no new tuple pairs left to process after this iteration.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is not applicable, `dy` is not applicable, `nx` is not applicable, `ny` is not applicable**
