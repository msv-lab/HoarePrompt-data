The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `1` are used directly in this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[3][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
