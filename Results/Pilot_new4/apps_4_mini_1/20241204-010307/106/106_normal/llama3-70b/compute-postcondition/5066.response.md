The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, but the `queue` now contains an additional element. The values of `dist`, `cur`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `parent` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, 2); `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `cur` is the current position, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, 2); `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
