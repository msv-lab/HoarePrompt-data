Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `queue` contains all elements added during the loop execution based on valid moves. If `piece` is equal to 0 and the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` are satisfied for any `ncur`, `dist` and `parent` reflect the shortest paths from `cur` for all reachable indices. If no valid moves are possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
