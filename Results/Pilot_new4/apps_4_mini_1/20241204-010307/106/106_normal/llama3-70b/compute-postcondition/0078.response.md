The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `nx = x` and `ny = y + 1`. The initial state gives us the constraints for `N`, but does not specify the values of `x`, `y`, or the contents of the array `A`. Therefore, we can only express `ncur` in terms of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1; ncur = A[nx][ny]**
