The line `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The variables `x` and `y` have specific values (`x` is 4 and `y` is 1), while `dx` and `dy` will take on values from a tuple list, but their specific values are not provided. 

This means:
- `nx` will be equal to `4 + dx`
- `ny` will be equal to `1 + dy`

The states of the variables `N`, `dx`, and `dy` will remain unchanged in this operation. However, we cannot specify exact values for `nx` and `ny` without knowing `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes made to `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the original conditions for `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `dx` and `dy` will take on the next values from the tuple list; the loop index must be less than 8 to execute one more time.**
