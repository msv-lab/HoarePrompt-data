Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if the condition `piece == 2` and `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds true, then `x` is -1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[-2][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition does not hold, no changes occur.***
