Initial State: `piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Now, please think step by step: 
- The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values calculated from `x` and `y` with the additions of `dx` and `dy`, respectively.
- The values of `dx` and `dy` are -1, which means `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y - 1`.
- The output state will depend on the values of `x` and `y`, which are not provided.

Since `x` and `y` are not defined, we cannot determine specific values for `nx` or `ny`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes made by the code, but we cannot specify actual numerical results for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`**
