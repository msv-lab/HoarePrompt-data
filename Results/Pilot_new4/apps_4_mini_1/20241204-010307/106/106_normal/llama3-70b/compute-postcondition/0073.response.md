Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` values, `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values, `queue` now contains all reachable `ncur` values along with the value 1 and the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and `N` (0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`), `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
