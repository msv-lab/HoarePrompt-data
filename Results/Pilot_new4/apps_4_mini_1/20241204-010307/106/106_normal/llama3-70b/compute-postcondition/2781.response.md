The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the `parent` array at the position `[2][ncur]` is being updated. This involves assigning two values: `cur` and `piece`. The variable `cur` maintains its previous value, and `piece` is currently equal to 2. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]`.

The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions. Thus, the output state should detail the prior conditions along with the new assignment made to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
