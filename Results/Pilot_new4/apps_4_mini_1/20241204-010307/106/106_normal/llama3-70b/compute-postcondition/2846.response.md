The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y + 1`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x` and `y`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
