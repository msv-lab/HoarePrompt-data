The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x + 1` and `y`, respectively. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`.**
