Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx` where `dx` is from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dy` is from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]. The current value of `nx` is such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `nx` is less than `N`, and the current value of `ny` is such that 0 is less than or equal to `ny` and `ny` is less than `N`***.
