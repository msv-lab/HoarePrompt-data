The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already defined as `3 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively, and they are confirmed to be within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N). This means that `ncur` will be assigned a valid value from the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent` corresponds to those reachable positions, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, and `ncur` is A[nx][ny].**
