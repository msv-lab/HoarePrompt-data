Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and `piece` is 2. If `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, and if `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
