The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we won't be able to detail them. However, the state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include all the unchanged variables and the new assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
