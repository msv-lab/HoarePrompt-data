According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the current states are `dx` and `dy` as the last tuple in the list. 

Since the loop is structured to iterate through all the provided `(dx, dy)` pairs, the last tuple processed will be `(2, 1)`. To determine the state for the next iteration, we will move to the next tuple in the list, which wraps around to the start since the loop has completed all iterations already.

Since there are 8 tuples in total, if we have gone through all of them, the next iteration will start again from the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will have:
- `N` remains the same (since it is not modified by the loop)
- `y` remains the same
- `piece` remains the same (no changes in this iteration)
- `nx` and `ny` will change according to the first tuple `(-2, -1)`.
  
Assuming `x` and `y` do not change, the new `nx` and `ny` would be `x - 2` and `y - 1`, respectively.

The conditions on `nx` and `ny` (that they must be within bounds) are still valid, and `ncur` is derived based on the checks described.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, and if `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
