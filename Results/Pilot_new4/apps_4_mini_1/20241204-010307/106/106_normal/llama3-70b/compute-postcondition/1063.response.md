Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist` reflects the shortest path distances from the starting position for all valid reachable `ncur` values, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations. The current value of `piece` is 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
