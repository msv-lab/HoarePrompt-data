Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions based on conditions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken for those updated positions, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions that met the conditions, and `piece` is 1. If there are valid positions to update (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), the distances and paths for those positions will be updated accordingly, and `queue` will include all tuples of updated positions. If no valid updates occur, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
