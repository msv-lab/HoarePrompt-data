Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece` when both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
