The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, and since `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, we need to maintain the relation for `ncur`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1.**
