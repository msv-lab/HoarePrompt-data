The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Given that `ncur` is `A[1][3]` and `cur` has a valid value, `dist[1][cur]` has already been updated for that valid `cur`. The output state will reflect the changes made by this assignment, while maintaining the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is `A[1][3]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
