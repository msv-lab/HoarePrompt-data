Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` is updated for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `parent[2]` is updated accordingly, and `queue` contains all valid moves along with the newly added `(cur, i)` if `piece` is 2 and `i` is not equal to 2. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
