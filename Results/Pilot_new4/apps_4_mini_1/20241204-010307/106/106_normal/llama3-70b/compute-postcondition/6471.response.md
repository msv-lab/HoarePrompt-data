The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the constant `2` remain unchanged by this operation, and the other variables in the initial state are not affected. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `queue` has a new element added to it, which is the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` has the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended.**
