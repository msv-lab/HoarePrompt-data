The code updates the `dist` array at index `[2][ncur]` to be equal to the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Since `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the current distance `dist[2][cur]`, incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is the value of A[x + 1][y], and dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1.**
