According to the code, the for loop iterates over the tuples `(dx, dy)` which represent directional movements. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, allowing the program to check in all four cardinal directions.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`. Additionally, other variables such as `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` are defined based on previous computations.

Since the loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples, it will execute a total of 4 times (once for each direction). After the last iteration of the loop, the loop would have already processed all values of `dx` and `dy` once. Thus, to execute one more time, the loop must run again starting from the first tuple.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` (where `dx` is -1 in the first iteration), `ny` is equal to `y + dy` (where `dy` is 0 in the first iteration), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (for the first iteration).**
