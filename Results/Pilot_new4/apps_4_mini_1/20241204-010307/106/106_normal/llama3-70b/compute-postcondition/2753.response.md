The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is the sum of `dist[1][cur]` and `1`. The previous condition states that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, meaning that the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, satisfying the condition.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, `queue` contains the tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
