The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous state mentions that `cur` is a variable whose value is valid, and `piece` is also a variable whose value is valid. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
