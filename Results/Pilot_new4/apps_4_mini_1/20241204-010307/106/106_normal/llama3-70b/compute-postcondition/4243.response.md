Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets. If `nx` and `ny` are within the valid range (0 to N-1), and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, while the value of `piece` remains 1. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
