Initial State: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `-1`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. 

We know that `dx` and `dy` are also defined, but their values are not provided. Assuming `dx` and `dy` are placeholders for some integer values. Therefore, the calculation for `nx` and `ny` is:
```
nx = x + dx  # nx will now equal 0 + dx
ny = y + dy  # ny will now equal 0 + dy
```

Since `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we can represent them in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is updated to `0 + dx`, `ny` is updated to `0 + dy`.**
