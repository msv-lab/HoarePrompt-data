Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to each valid `ncur` position if `piece` is 1; otherwise, `dist[1][ncur]` remains unchanged. `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the parent positions and pieces leading to each `ncur`. `queue` contains all reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions. If no iterations were executed, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
