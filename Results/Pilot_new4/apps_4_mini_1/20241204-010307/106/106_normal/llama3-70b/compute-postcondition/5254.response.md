Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is between 0 and N-1. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` contains the shortest distances from position (3, y) to all reachable positions, `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions updated during the loop, and `queue` contains all valid tuples that were appended during the loop execution. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values. If no iterations execute because no valid `y` values satisfy the condition `A[x][y] == cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
