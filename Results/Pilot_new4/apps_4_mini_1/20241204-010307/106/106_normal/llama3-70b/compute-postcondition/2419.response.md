According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the direction changes defined by `(dx, dy)`. Each time it iterates, it assigns a new value to `dx` and `dy` based on the tuple being processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is currently -1 and `dy` is -1, which corresponds to the first tuple in the list. After this, the loop will proceed to the next tuple. 

The next tuple in the iteration is `(-1, 1)`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` should become -1 and `dy` should become 1. 

There are no other state variables in the loop that need to change for it to execute again since the loop structure itself just cycles through the predefined tuples.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is -1.**
