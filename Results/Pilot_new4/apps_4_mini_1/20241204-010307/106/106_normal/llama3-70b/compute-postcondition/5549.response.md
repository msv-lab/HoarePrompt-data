According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples containing the values for `(dx, dy)`. Since this list is predefined and contains four pairs of values, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `queue`, `dist`, `parent`, `x`, `y`, and `A[0][0]`. 

However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute correctly. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples in each iteration. There are no external conditions preventing the loop from executing, and the input states do not directly affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initialization of `dx` and `dy`, which will be done automatically by the iteration over the list of tuples.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `A[0][0]` is unchanged, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the tuples in each iteration**
