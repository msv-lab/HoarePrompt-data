The code snippet updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by adding 1 to `dist[1][cur]`. The previous condition indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which confirms that the update will indeed take place. The preconditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `piece`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.
