The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `y` with the additions of `dx` and `dy` respectively. The variables `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `nx` and `ny` may have specific values based on `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
