The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and also includes `piece` in the assignment. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, and `parent` is updated for the specific indices. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `A` remain unchanged, while `parent` will now reflect the new assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `dist` is updated at [2][ncur] to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`.**
