The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, which is determined based on the previous state of the array `A` and the calculated index `nx` (which is `x - 2`). The variable `queue` is being modified to include this new tuple, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Since the specific values of `ncur`, `queue`, and the contents of `A` are not provided, the output state focuses on the fact that the `queue` has been updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
