Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece`, and the `queue` contains a tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
