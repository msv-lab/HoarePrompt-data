Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is `y + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not met, no changes take place.***
