According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of directions defined in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. Each iteration processes a direction `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute one more time for the next pair of directions if there are more pairs available in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, we have already processed one direction. Given that there are 4 pairs in total, if we have processed the first `i` pairs, the next pair will be `(dx, dy)` corresponding to index `i`.

Since `dx` and `dy` can take the values from the pairs, for the loop to be executed one more time, the index `i` must be increased by 1 until it reaches 4. Therefore, the states need to reflect that.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction in the list, and the index is 4**.
