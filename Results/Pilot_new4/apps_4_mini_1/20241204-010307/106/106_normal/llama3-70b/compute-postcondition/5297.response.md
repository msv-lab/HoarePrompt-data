The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are 3 and 1, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will now hold the value of the element in the array `A` located at the index `[3][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[3][1]`.**
