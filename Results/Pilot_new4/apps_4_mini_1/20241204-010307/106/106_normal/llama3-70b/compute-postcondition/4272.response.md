The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the new values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `x + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`. The value of `x` is 1, and the value of `y` is `N - 1`, where `N` is an integer between 3 and 10. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
