According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `dx` and `dy` which are being iterated over a predefined list of tuples. The state variables `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` do not directly affect the iteration itself since the loop does not require any additional conditions to execute based on those variables.

However, to ensure that the loop iterates correctly and the `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are relevant for the operations performed within the loop body, we could consider the following:

1. The loop executes 8 times, once for each tuple in the list `[(−2,−1), (−2,1), (−1,−2), (−1,2), (1,−2), (1,2), (2,−1), (2,1)]`. 
2. No adjustments are needed for `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` to ensure that the loop executes since they will not affect the ability of the loop to run.

Thus, the only relevant variables for ensuring that the loop can execute are `dx` and `dy`, which will take on each value in the list as the loop progresses. Since `piece` is unchanged and does not interact with the loop conditions, it remains as is.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances, `parent` reflects corresponding parents, `piece` remains unchanged at 2, `queue` contains (cur, i) if A[x][y] equals cur and piece is not equal to i, otherwise they remain unchanged, `dx` and `dy` will iterate through the 8 tuples in the list.**
