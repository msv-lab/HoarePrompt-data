The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. However, since `parent` is a structure where `parent[0][ncur]` can hold two values, we interpret that `cur` is being set in `parent[0][ncur]`. 

No other variables are modified by this operation. The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
