Given the initial state, we see the following conditions: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to `ny` being out of bounds. 

Now, analyzing the line of code:
```
dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1
```

The code attempts to assign a value to `dist[1][ncur]`. However, since `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to `ny` being out of bounds, this line cannot execute successfully. Hence, there are no changes to any of the variables or the state. 

The output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged and highlights that `ncur` is still invalid.

Output State: **If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to `ny` being out of bounds.**
