The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The current values of `y` and `ny` are given as `y = 0` and `ny = 0`, which means `dy` must be `0` for `ny` to remain unchanged. The value of `nx` also depends on `x` and `dx`, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, `nx` will be updated to `x + dx`, and `ny` will remain `0` regardless of its previous state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0.**
