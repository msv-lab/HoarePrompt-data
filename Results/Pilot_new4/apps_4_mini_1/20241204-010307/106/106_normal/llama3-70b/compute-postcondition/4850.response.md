The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is the original x position, and `y` is the original y position + 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express them in terms of the existing variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is the original x position, `y` is the original y position + 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
