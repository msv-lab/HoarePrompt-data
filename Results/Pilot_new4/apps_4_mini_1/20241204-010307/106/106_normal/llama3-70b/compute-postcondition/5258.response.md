According to the code, the loop will execute as it iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing the directions (`dx`, `dy`). The loop will always execute 8 times regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A`, or `cur`, as the iteration is based on the fixed array of tuples.

However, to ensure the loop executes correctly within the context of the program, we need to consider the variables involved:

1. The variables `dx` and `dy` will be assigned values from the predefined list of tuples in each iteration, so there's no need to adjust their initial state.
2. Since `A[x][0]` must equal `cur`, and we know that `A[4][0]` is already equal to `cur`, we are assured that the necessary condition for `A` is satisfied.
3. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant during the loop's body execution.

Therefore, the key states that need to be reaffirmed before the loop starts are `N` being between 4 and 10, `x` being 4, `y` being 0, and that the current value of `A[4][0]` is `cur`.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`**
