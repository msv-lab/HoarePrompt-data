The code `queue.append((cur, i))` appends a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `i` to the list `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state but are implied to have valid values based on the context provided. The `dist` and `parent` matrices and the variable `piece` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables along with the updated state of `queue` which now contains the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` represents all previous positions leading to each updated `ncur`, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
