Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, there is no change to the variables.***
