The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is updated to reflect the addition of the new element in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is either -1 or 1, `ny` is either 1 or 3, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and is not greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
