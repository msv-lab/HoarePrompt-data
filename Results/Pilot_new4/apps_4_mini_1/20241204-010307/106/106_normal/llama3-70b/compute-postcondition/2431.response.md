The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `x + dx` and `dy`, respectively, and both are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N). The state of other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N); `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
