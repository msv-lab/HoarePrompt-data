The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables involved in this code are `ncur`, which is currently `A[1][3]`, and the constant value `1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Since `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists prior to this code snippet. The state of `ncur` remains as `A[1][3]`. 

The output state will reflect the addition of the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue` without changing any other variable values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[1][3]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
