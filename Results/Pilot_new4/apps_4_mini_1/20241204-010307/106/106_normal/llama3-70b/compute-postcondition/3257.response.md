In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only acknowledge the effect of the code on the `nx` and `ny` variables in terms of their dependence on `dx` and `dy`.

Given:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is `0`
- `y` is `1`
- `nx` is `-2`
- `ny` is `0`

Since `nx` and `ny` will be recalculated based on `x` and `y` along with `dx` and `dy`, we cannot define their specific numeric results without knowing the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, we can express their new values in terms of the original values of `x` and `y`.

The impact of the code is that:
- `nx` will now become `0 + dx`
- `ny` will now become `1 + dy`

Thus, the output state after executing the code snippet will be:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
