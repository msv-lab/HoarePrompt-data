The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current distance `dist[0][cur]`. 

- The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means that `dist[0][ncur]` will now reflect the distance from the start to `ncur`, incremented by 1 from the distance to `cur`.
- The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `parent`, `queue`, `A`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged and continue to hold their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all reachable tuples and includes `(ncur, 0)`, `A[2][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
