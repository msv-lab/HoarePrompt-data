According to the provided code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing possible movements in 2D space (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute for each of these directional movements regardless of the conditions related to `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. 

Thus, the states that need to be assessed before the loop starts would relate to the initial values of `dx` and `dy` as they will be assigned on each iteration of the loop. Since these variables will be set by the loop, there is no need to adjust them before the loop execution. 

However, the main focus should be on ensuring that the loop will at least be able to iterate. Given the code, there are no requirements that depend on the contents of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` for the loop to execute. Therefore, these states can remain unchanged.

State: **`piece` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur` for all reachable indices, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `dx` and `dy` will take values from [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] during each iteration of the loop.**
