The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N-1, the value of `ncur` will be determined by the values present in the 2D list `A` at the indices `[dx][dy]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and `ny` is between 0 and N-1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and `ny` is between 0 and N-1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
