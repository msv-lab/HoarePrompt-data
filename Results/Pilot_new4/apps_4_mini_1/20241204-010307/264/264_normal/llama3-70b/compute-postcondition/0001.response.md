The variable `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which accepts user input and converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 10,000 \). Therefore, the valid values for `m` remain within this range after the execution of the code. The value of `n` and the array `a_i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input, `m` is a positive integer based on user input and such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 10,000 \), and `a_i` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \)**.
