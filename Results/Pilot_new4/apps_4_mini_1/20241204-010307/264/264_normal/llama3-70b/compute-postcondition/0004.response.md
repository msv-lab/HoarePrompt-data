The value of `max(a)` is the maximum element in the list `a`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The variable `max_k` is assigned the value of `max(a)` plus `m`, where `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. Therefore, `max_k` will be a positive integer that is at least `max(a) + 1` and can go up to `max(a) + 10,000`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input; `m` is a positive integer based on user input such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 10,000 \); `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \text{ for } i \text{ from } 1 \text{ to } n \); `min_k` is equal to `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`; `max_k` is equal to `max(a) + m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `m` is a positive integer based on user input such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i from 1 to n; `min_k` is equal to `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n; `max_k` is equal to `max(a) + m.**
