The provided program is designed to calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of `k`, the maximum number of people sitting on a single bench after `m` additional people arrive in the park. 

Let's analyze its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Maximum Possible `k`:** 
   - The program calculates `max_k` as `max(a) + m`. This correctly reflects the scenario where all `m` new people sit on the same bench that already has the most people (`max(a)`). Hence, the maximum value of `k` is accurately calculated.
   
2. **Minimum Possible `k`:**
   - The program calculates `min_k` using the formula `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`. This formula is effectively calculating the maximum number of people on the fullest bench after distributing the `m` new people as evenly as possible across `n` benches.
   - The expression `(m + n - 1) // n` is a way to compute the ceiling of `m/n` without using floating-point division. This part effectively adds enough people to the maximum number on a bench to account for the even distribution of new arrivals.
   - The reason this works for `min_k` is that it assumes the best-case scenario where people are distributed as evenly as possible, and then adds those people to the already maximum occupied bench.

**Conclusion:**
The program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates both the minimum and maximum possible values of `k` correctly given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
