To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function against the requirements set forth in the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**:
   - An integer `n`, the number of benches.
   - An integer `m`, the number of additional people coming to the park.
   - A list of integers `a_i`, representing the current number of people sitting on each bench.

2. **Output**:
   - Two integers representing:
     - The minimum possible maximum number of people (`k`) sitting on one bench after `m` additional people arrive.
     - The maximum possible `k`.

### Analysis of the Program:

**1. Maximum Possible `k`:**
- Calculated as `max(a) + m`. This is correct because the maximum possible number of people on one bench occurs when all `m` new arrivals choose to sit on the already most crowded bench.

**2. Minimum Possible `k`:**
- The logic used for calculating `min_k` is `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`.
  - This is an attempt to evenly distribute the `m` people across `n` benches. 
  - The expression `(m + n - 1) // n` effectively computes the ceiling of `m/n`, which gives the minimum number of additional people that need to be added to the bench with the most people to balance the load.

### Validation:
- **Minimum Calculation**: 
  - After distributing the `m` people as evenly as possible, the maximum number of people on any bench would be the highest current occupancy (`max(a)`) plus the number of people that can be added to that bench given the even distribution.
  
- **Maximum Calculation**: 
  - The maximum calculation is straightforward and accurately reflects the described scenario.

### Example Cases:
1. For `n=4`, `m=6`, `a=[1, 1, 1, 1]`:
   - Maximum: `1 + 6 = 7`
   - Minimum: `1 + (6 + 4 - 1) // 4 = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - Output should be `3 7`.

2. For `n=1`, `m=10`, `a=[5]`:
   - Maximum: `5 + 10 = 15`
   - Minimum: `5 + (10 + 1 - 1) // 1 = 5 + 10 = 15`
   - Both outputs are `15 15`.

3. For `n=3`, `m=7`, `a=[1, 6, 5]`:
   - Maximum: `6 + 7 = 13`
   - Minimum: `6 + (7 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 6 + 2 = 8`
   - The output is `8 13`, which is a valid case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum and maximum numbers of people that can occupy the benches after `m` new arrivals based on the given distributions.

Therefore, the final correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
