The code prints the values of `min_k` and `max_k`. The variables themselves remain unchanged by this operation, and no new values are assigned. However, we can clarify their values based on the initial state.

- `max_k` is equal to `initial_max + m`.
- `min_k` is equal to `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`.

The previous conditions remain valid, and we now have the explicit forms of `min_k` and `max_k`. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100 inclusive), `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `total_people` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `max_k` is equal to `initial_max + m`, `min_k` is equal to `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`, and the values of `min_k` and `max_k` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100 inclusive), `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `total_people` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `max_k` is equal to `initial_max + m`, `min_k` is equal to `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`, min_k and max_k have been printed.**
