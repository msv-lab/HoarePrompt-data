`initial_max` is assigned the value of the maximum integer from the list `a`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, and `a` consists of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100. Therefore, `initial_max` will be an integer between 1 and 100, specifically the highest value found in the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `initial_max` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
