The function accepts two inputs, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of elements in an array and `m` is an additional integer value. It then reads `n` integers into an array `a`. The function calculates the maximum value of the array `a` and the total of all elements in `a`. It computes two values: `min_k`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the total people plus `m`, and `max_k`, which adds `m` to the maximum value in the array. Finally, it prints both `min_k` and `max_k`. The function does not have any explicit return values; it simply outputs the calculated values to the console.
