Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement regarding calculating the minimum and maximum possible number of people sitting on a bench after additional people arrive in the park. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` (the number of benches), `m` (the number of additional people), and the list `a` (the initial number of people sitting on each bench). This aligns with the input requirements described.

2. **Maximum Calculation**: 
   - It finds `initial_max`, which is the maximum number of people currently sitting on any bench using `max(a)`. 
   - It then calculates `max_k` as `initial_max + m`, which correctly represents the maximum possible number of people on a single bench after all `m` people sit on that bench. This is in accordance with the problem statement.

3. **Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program sums up the initial number of people on all benches with `total_people = sum(a)`.
   - It computes `min_k` using the formula `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`. This formula, which effectively performs a ceiling division, correctly distributes the `m` additional people across the `n` benches while ensuring that the minimum maximum number of people on any single bench is accounted for. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to find the minimum possible `k`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints both `min_k` and `max_k`, which matches the output requirements of the problem description.

The program handles edge cases, including when there is only one bench, by summing all people and adding newcomers directly to the existing count. It adheres to the constraints that all values of `n`, `m`, and `a_i` fall within their specified ranges.

Thus, the program logically follows the problem description and correctly computes the required values. Therefore, the result is that the program is correct.
