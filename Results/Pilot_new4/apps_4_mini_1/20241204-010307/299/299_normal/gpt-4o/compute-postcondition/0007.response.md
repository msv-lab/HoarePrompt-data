Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, which must satisfy the conditions \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18} \) and \( k \leq n \). It calculates the integer division of `n` by `k`, checks if the result is odd or even, and prints 'YES' if it is odd, and 'NO' if it is even. There are no return values from the function; instead, it directly outputs the result. **
