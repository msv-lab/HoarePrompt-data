The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` splits the input and converts each part to an integer. Before the execution, `n` and `k` are known to be positive integers such that \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18} \) and \( k \leq n \). After the input is taken, the specific values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input values provided during execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \) and `k` is an input positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)**.
