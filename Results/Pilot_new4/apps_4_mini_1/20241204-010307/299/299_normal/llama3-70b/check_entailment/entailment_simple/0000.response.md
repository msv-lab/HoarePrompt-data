To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the logic of the program.

### Problem Recap:
- Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out `k` sticks from `n` sticks.
- Sasha goes first.
- If there are fewer than `k` sticks at the start of a player's turn, that player cannot make a move.
- Sasha wins if he has made strictly more moves than Lena.

### Analysis of Moves:
1. When Sasha takes his turn, he will cross out `k` sticks.
2. For every pair of turns (one for Sasha and one for Lena), `2k` sticks are crossed out.
3. The game ends when there are fewer than `k` sticks left.

### Key Condition to Determine the Winner:
- The total number of moves made is `n // k` (this counts the full pairs of `k` sticks).
- If `n // k` is even, then both Sasha and Lena have made the same number of moves.
- If `n // k` is odd, Sasha has made one more move than Lena.

### Logic in the Program:
The program checks the condition:
```python
if ((n - 1) // k > n // k) :
```
This condition is not correctly aligned with the winning criteria:
- Instead, it should check whether `n // k % 2 == 1` (meaning `n // k` is odd) to determine if Sasha has made strictly more moves than Lena.

### Example Walkthroughs:
- For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `n // k` is `1`, which is odd. Sasha wins. Correct output: "YES".
- For `n = 10`, `k = 4`, `n // k` is `2`, which is even. Sasha does not win. Correct output: "NO".

### Conclusion:
The condition used in the program:
```python
((n - 1) // k > n // k)
```
is incorrect because it does not correctly check if Sasha has more turns than Lena. 

Thus, the program does not implement the logic to determine if Sasha wins as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
