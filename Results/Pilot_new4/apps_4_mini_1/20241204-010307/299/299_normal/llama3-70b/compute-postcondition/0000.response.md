The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input, which represents two integers. Given the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n, the values of `n` and `k` change to whatever integers are provided as input. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from input, `k` is an integer assigned from input, with the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n still holding true.**
