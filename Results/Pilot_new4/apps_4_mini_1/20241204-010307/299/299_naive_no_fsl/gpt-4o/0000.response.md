To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The goal of the game is for Sasha to determine if he will make strictly more moves than Lena given `n` sticks and the requirement that exactly `k` sticks are crossed out per turn. Sasha moves first.

**Key Points from the Problem Description:**
1. The game ends if there are fewer than `k` sticks before a player's turn.
2. Sasha wins if he has made strictly more moves than Lena.

**Understanding the Moves:**
- Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
- The total number of complete turns that can be made is `n // k`.

**Turns Analysis:**
- If `n // k` is the total number of turns, it can be broken down as:
  - If `n // k` is odd, Sasha will have made one more move than Lena because he starts first.
  - If `n // k` is even, they will make an equal number of moves, and Sasha will not win.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n // k % 2 == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

The program checks if the number of complete turns (`n // k`) is odd, which is correct because if it's odd, Sasha wins.

**Testing Edge Cases:**
1. **Minimum Input Values:**
   - Input: `1 1` 
     - Calculation: `1 // 1 = 1` (odd) → Output: `YES` (Correct)
   
2. **Even Turns:**
   - Input: `10 4`
     - Calculation: `10 // 4 = 2` (even) → Output: `NO` (Correct)
   
3. **Another Edge Case:**
   - Input: `k = 1`, `n = 5` 
     - Calculation: `5 // 1 = 5` (odd) → Output: `YES` (Correct)
   
4. **Maximum Values:**
   - Input: `10^18 1` 
     - Calculation: `10^18 // 1 = 10^18` (even) → Output: `NO` (Correct)
   
5. **Large Even Case:**
   - Input: `10^18 10^18` 
     - Calculation: `10^18 // 10^18 = 1` (odd) → Output: `YES` (Correct)
   
6. **Another Large Even Case:**
   - Input: `10^18 2` 
     - Calculation: `10^18 // 2 = 5 * 10^17` (odd) → Output: `YES` (Correct)

Through this analysis, the program correctly identifies the winner based on the rules established in the problem description for all tested cases.

**Conclusion:**
Since we could not find any cases where the program does not correctly determine the winner based on the rules provided, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
