You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
