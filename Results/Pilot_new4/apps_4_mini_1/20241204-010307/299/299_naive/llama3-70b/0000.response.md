To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the game in detail.

The problem states that Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks, with Sasha going first. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. We need to check if the provided program correctly determines this outcome.

Let's break down the program:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

**Understanding the Logic:**
1. The expression `(n - 1) // k` calculates the maximum number of moves Sasha can make.
2. The expression `n // k` calculates the maximum number of moves both players can make combined.
3. If Sasha's moves `(n - 1) // k` are greater than the combined moves `n // k`, that implies Sasha has made more moves than Lena.

**Key Cases:**
- For `n = 1, k = 1`: 
  - Sasha crosses out 1 stick => `0` sticks left, Lena cannot play. Output should be "YES".
  
- For `n = 10, k = 4`:
  - Sasha crosses 4 sticks ⇒ `6` remaining.
  - Lena crosses 4 sticks ⇒ `2` remaining.
  - Sasha cannot make a move as only 2 sticks remain. Both have made 2 moves. Output should be "NO".

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **When `n` is less than `k`**: The input constraints guarantee `k ≤ n`, so we do not have to handle this scenario.
2. **When `k = 1`**: Each player removes 1 stick at a time. Sasha will always make one more move when `n` is odd. The program should reflect this correctly.
3. **When `k = n`**: Sasha will remove all sticks on the first turn, and Lena cannot play. The output should be "YES".

**Analyzing the Program Logic:**
The program uses integer division to decide the win condition based on total potential moves. However, it does not correctly handle the situation where Sasha's moves are equal to Lena's moves in cases where the total number of sticks goes down below `k` after both have played. 

For example, if `n = 8` and `k = 4`:
- Moves: (Sasha: 4, Lena: 4) 
- Result: No remaining sticks, both have equal moves, hence output should be "NO".

The provided formula `(n - 1) // k > n // k` does not account for the scenario where they might have the same number of moves when the sticks are exactly divisible by `k`.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the above analysis, the program does not always yield the correct result for all potential cases, particularly regarding scenarios where both players make an equal number of moves.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases where both players make equal moves, like `n = 8, k = 4`, where the output should be "NO", but the program would incorrectly evaluate the condition.
