To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic against the problem description.

The problem states that Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks. Sasha moves first, and he wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena when the game ends.

The program checks the condition with the following logic:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n // k % 2 == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - `n // k`: This expression calculates how many complete moves (of `k` sticks) can be made by both players.
   - `n // k % 2`: This checks if the total number of complete moves is odd or even.
     - If odd (`% 2 == 1`), it suggests that Sasha has made more moves than Lena (since he starts first).
     - If even (`% 2 == 0`), it suggests that both players have made the same number of moves.

2. **Checking for Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1` and `k = 1`, Sasha crosses out the only stick and wins. The program outputs "YES", which is correct.
   - When `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the players can take turns removing sticks:
     - Sasha removes 4 (6 left)
     - Lena removes 4 (2 left)
     - No more moves possible for Sasha. Sasha and Lena both made 2 moves, so the output should be "NO", which the program gives, so this is also correct.
   - When `n = k`, thereâ€™s only one move possible for Sasha, and Lena can't move after that. This should always yield "YES".

3. **Additional Cases**:
   - For any even `n // k`, both players make the same number of moves, so the output should be "NO".
   - For any odd `n // k`, Sasha has one more move than Lena, so the output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and considering possible edge cases, I find that the logic correctly determines the winner based on the provided constraints. There are no potential cases that the program fails to handle according to the problem specification.

Correctness: **True**.
