You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t, s, and x are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t, s, x = map(int, input().split())
    if (x == t) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (x > t) :
            if ((x - t) % s == 0) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                if ((x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1) :
                    print('YES')
                else :
                    print('NO')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9. If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if either `(x - t - 1) % s != 0` or `x` is equal to `t + 1`, the output is 'NO'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`, `x` is greater than `t`. If `(x - t) % s == 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`. If `x` is greater than `t`, the output will be 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` (provided `x` is not equal to `t + 1`); otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. If `x` is less than or equal to `t`, the output will be 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9.

If `x` is greater than `t`, the output will be 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` (provided `x` is not equal to `t + 1`); otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
