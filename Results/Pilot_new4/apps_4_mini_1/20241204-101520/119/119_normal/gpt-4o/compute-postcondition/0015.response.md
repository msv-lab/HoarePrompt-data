The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state indicates that the string 'NO' was printed, but the conditions on `t`, `s`, and `x` still hold. 

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; `x` is not equal to `t`; `x` is less than or equal to `t`; 'NO' was printed.**
