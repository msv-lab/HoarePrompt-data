The code simply prints 'YES', which does not modify any variables. The initial conditions regarding `t`, `s`, and `x` remain valid. Therefore, the output state only reflects the unchanged properties of the variables.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`, the current value of `x` is greater than `t`, and the difference `(x - t)` is not a multiple of `s`. The current value of `x - t - 1` is such that it is a multiple of `s`, and `x` is not equal to `t + 1. The output is 'YES'.**
