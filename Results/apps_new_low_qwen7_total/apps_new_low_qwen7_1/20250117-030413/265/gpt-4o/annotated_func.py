#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of seats on the airplane, and MOD is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7, representing the modulo value for the final result.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result = (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)
    return result
    #The program returns the value of result which is calculated as (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the value of \((2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) \% (10^9 + 7)\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each integer within this range and taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. This ensures that the final result is always within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. The function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by returning 1, as the product of integers starting from 2 up to a number less than 2 is not defined in the problem statement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), m is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ m ≤ n), MOD is a constant integer equal to 10^9 + 7, and func_1 is a function that calculates the factorial of its integer argument.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #The program returns ways, which is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) modulo (10^9 + 7)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of seats and `m` is the number of passengers. It calculates the value of `ways` using the formula `(2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) % MOD`, where `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`, `fact_n_m` is the factorial of `n-m`, and `inverse_of(fact_n_m)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact_n_m` modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function returns `ways`. 

Potential edge cases include when `n` or `m` are outside their specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n). However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases; it assumes valid inputs. If `n` or `m` are invalid, the behavior of the function is undefined, possibly leading to errors due to invalid arguments in the `func_1` calls or incorrect results due to invalid mathematical operations.

Missing functionality includes input validation to ensure `n` and `m` are within the specified range. Additionally, while the function calculates the required value, it does not provide any information about the intermediate results such as the factorials or the modular multiplicative inverse, which could be useful for debugging or understanding the calculation process.
