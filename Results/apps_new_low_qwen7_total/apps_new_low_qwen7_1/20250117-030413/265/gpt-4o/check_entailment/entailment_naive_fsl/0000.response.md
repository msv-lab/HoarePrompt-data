Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each passenger can independently choose either the front or back entrance, and it does not simulate the boarding process to ensure that no passenger gets angry.

The `func_1` function calculates the factorial of a number, which is used in `func_2`. However, `func_2` does not correctly simulate the boarding process. It assumes that the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane without anyone getting angry is simply the number of permutations of passengers choosing entrances multiplied by the permutations of seats, which is not accurate.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
128
```

However, the program provided will not produce the correct output because it does not simulate the actual boarding process. For instance, it does not handle the scenario where a passenger chooses a different entrance and finds their seat already occupied, causing them to walk further down the row until they find an empty seat.

A correct solution would involve simulating the boarding process, ensuring that each passenger finds an available seat regardless of the entrance chosen. This involves dynamic programming or a more complex combinatorial approach to count valid seat assignments and entrance choices.
