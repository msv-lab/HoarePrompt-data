### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the solution step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - Each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance.
   - A passenger will take the first available seat in their assigned row if it is occupied, or they will get angry if they reach the end of the row without finding a seat.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The problem involves permutations and combinatorial calculations.
   - The number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane without anger is related to the number of permutations of seating assignments and entrance choices.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(n)`: This function calculates \( n! \) (n factorial) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - It correctly uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid ways to assign tickets and board the plane.
     - `fact_n` is \( n! \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - `fact_n_m` is \( (n - m)! \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - The formula used is \( 2^m \times \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
       - \( 2^m \) accounts for the choice of entrance (front or back) for each of the \( m \) passengers.
       - \( \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) is the number of ways to choose \( m \) seats out of \( n \) seats and arrange them.
     - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) is correct to compute \( (n - m)! \) in modular arithmetic.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the combinatorial calculation required for the problem.
   - The modular arithmetic operations ensure correctness within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
