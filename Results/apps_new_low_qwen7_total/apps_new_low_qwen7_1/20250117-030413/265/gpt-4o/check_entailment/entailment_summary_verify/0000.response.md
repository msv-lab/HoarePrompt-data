### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
- Each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance.
- If a passenger's seat is occupied, they will walk down the aisle until they find an empty seat.
- The number of ways should be calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Function Analysis:
1. **func_1**: This function calculates the factorial of a number.
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       result = 1
       for i in range(2, n + 1):
           result = result * i % MOD
       return result
   ```

2. **func_2**: This function calculates the number of valid ways to assign tickets and board the plane.
   ```python
   def func_2(n, m):
       fact_n = func_1(n)
       fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
       ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
       return ways
   ```

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_2` uses the formula \((2^m \cdot \text{fact}_n \cdot \text{inverse}(\text{fact}_{n-m})) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- Here, \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of \(n\), \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) is the factorial of \(n-m\), and \(\text{inverse}(\text{fact}_{n-m})\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correctness of the Program:
1. **Factorials Calculation**: The factorial calculation in `func_1` is correct and follows the expected behavior.
2. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: The use of the modular multiplicative inverse is correct and ensures that the division operation is performed under modulo arithmetic.
3. **Formula for Ways**: The formula used in `func_2` is derived from combinatorial principles and correctly accounts for the number of ways passengers can choose entrances and assign seats such that no one gets angry.

Given the formula \((2^m \cdot \text{fact}_n \cdot \text{inverse}(\text{fact}_{n-m})) \mod (10^9 + 7)\):
- \(2^m\) accounts for the \(2^m\) ways each of the \(m\) passengers can choose either the front or back entrance.
- \(\text{fact}_n\) accounts for the permutations of assigning \(n\) seats.
- \(\text{inverse}(\text{fact}_{n-m})\) ensures that the division is done correctly under modulo arithmetic.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the number of valid ways to assign tickets and board the plane without anyone getting angry using the correct formula and combinatorial principles.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
