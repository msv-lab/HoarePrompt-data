### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided functions and the overall logic of the program against the problem description.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - Each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance.
   - A passenger will take the first available seat in their assigned row if it is occupied, or they will get angry if they reach the end of the row without finding a seat.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The solution needs to consider all possible combinations of seat assignments and entrance choices.
   - The formula used in `func_2` is indeed correct for calculating the number of valid ways to assign and board the plane without anger.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(n)`: This function calculates \( n! \) (n factorial) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - This is correct and necessary for the combinatorial calculations.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid ways to assign tickets and board the plane.
     - `fact_n` is \( n! \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - `fact_n_m` is \( (n - m)! \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - The formula used is \( 2^m \times \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
       - \( 2^m \) accounts for the choice of entrance (front or back) for each of the \( m \) passengers.
       - \( \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) is the number of ways to choose \( m \) seats out of \( n \) seats and arrange them.
     - The use of modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) is correct to compute \( (n - m)! \) in modular arithmetic.

However, there are a few critical points to verify:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
  - The use of `pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)` to compute the modular inverse is correct, but it assumes that `fact_n_m` is coprime with \( 10^9 + 7 \). Since \( 10^9 + 7 \) is a prime number, this assumption holds true.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when \( n \) or \( m \) are out of bounds (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1,000,000 and 1 ≤ \( m \) ≤ \( n \)). While the function assumes valid inputs, handling such cases would make the function more robust.

- **Intermediate Results:**
  - The function summary mentions that intermediate results like factorials and modular inverses are not provided, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the calculation process.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The logic and the formulas used are correct, and the modular arithmetic ensures that the results are computed accurately.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
