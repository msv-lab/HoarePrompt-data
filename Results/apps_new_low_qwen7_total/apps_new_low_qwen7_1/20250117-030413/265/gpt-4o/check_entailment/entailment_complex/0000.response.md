Reasoning:
1. The provided solution consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. `func_2` uses the output of `func_1` to compute the number of valid boarding sequences for `m` passengers out of `n` seats, considering that each passenger can choose between two entrances.
4. The formula used in `func_2` is correct and aligns with the combinatorial logic needed to solve the problem:
   - \(2^m\) accounts for the choice of entrance for each of the `m` passengers.
   - `fact_n` represents the number of ways to arrange `n` seats.
   - `fact_n_m` represents the number of ways to arrange `n-m` empty seats.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse of `fact_n_m` is used to divide by `fact_n_m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
5. The overall logic and the mathematical approach used in the code match the problem statement requirements.
6. While the code does not explicitly validate the input values for `n` and `m`, it is assumed that valid inputs are provided based on the problem constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
