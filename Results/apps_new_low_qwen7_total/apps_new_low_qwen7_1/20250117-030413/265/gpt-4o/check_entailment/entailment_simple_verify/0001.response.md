### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the functions provided, ensuring that every aspect aligns with the problem requirements and the given annotations.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no passenger gets angry.
   - Each passenger can choose either the front or back entrance.
   - A passenger will take the first available seat in their assigned row if it is occupied, or they will get angry if they reach the end of the row without finding a seat.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The problem involves permutations and combinatorial calculations.
   - The number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane without anger is related to the number of permutations of seating assignments and entrance choices.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**

   - **Function `func_1(n)`**:
     - Calculates \( n! \) (n factorial) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - Correctly uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.
     - The state annotations indicate that the function correctly computes the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

   - **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
     - Calculates \( 2^m \times \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - Uses the modular inverse (`pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`) to compute \( (n - m)! \) in modular arithmetic.
     - The formula \( 2^m \times \frac{n!}{(n - m)!} \) accounts for the choice of entrance (front or back) for each of the \( m \) passengers and the number of ways to choose and arrange \( m \) seats out of \( n \).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the combinatorial calculation required for the problem.
   - The modular arithmetic operations ensure correctness within the constraints.
   - The state annotations accurately describe the program's state at key points.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
   - The functions and the overall logic are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
