Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign tickets and board the plane such that no one gets angry. This means every passenger must find a seat.
   - A passenger can choose either the front or back entrance and will occupy the first available seat.
   - We need to return the count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The `func_1` function computes the factorial of \(n\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The `func_2` function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the required number of ways using combinatorial mathematics.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       result = 1
       for i in range(2, n + 1):
           result = result * i % MOD
       return result
   ```
   - This function correctly computes \(n!\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(n, m):
       fact_n = func_1(n)
       fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
       ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
       return ways
   ```
   - `fact_n` is the factorial of \(n\).
   - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of \(n - m\).
   - The formula used is \( \text{ways} = (2^m \times \frac{n!}{(n-m)!}) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - This is derived from combinatorics: the number of ways to assign \(m\) passengers to \(n\) seats with the given constraints.

5. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The term \(2^m\) represents the number of choices each passenger has (front or back entrance).
   - \(\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}\) is the number of permutations of assigning \(m\) passengers to \(n\) seats.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The implementation accurately follows the combinatorial logic to solve the problem.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
