Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to assign seats and entrances to passengers such that no one gets angry. 
2. The solution involves calculating factorials and using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.
3. The `func_1` function correctly computes the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
4. The `func_2` function uses the output of `func_1` to compute the total number of valid ways to board the plane. It uses the formula:
   \[
   \text{ways} = (2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times \text{inv}(\text{fact}_{n-m})) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   where:
   - \(2^m\) represents the choices of entrance for each passenger.
   - \(\text{fact}_n\) is the factorial of the total number of seats.
   - \(\text{inv}(\text{fact}_{n-m})\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of the remaining seats after assigning \(m\) seats.

Given the provided execution summaries, the functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The calculations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

Since the problem description matches the implementation and all necessary calculations are performed accurately, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
