The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the value of \((2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) \% (10^9 + 7)\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each integer within this range and taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. This ensures that the final result is always within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. The function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by returning 1, as the product of integers starting from 2 up to a number less than 2 is not defined in the problem statement.
