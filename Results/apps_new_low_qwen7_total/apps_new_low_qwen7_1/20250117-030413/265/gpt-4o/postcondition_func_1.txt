The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of seats and `m` is the number of passengers. It calculates the value of `ways` using the formula `(2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) % MOD`, where `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`, `fact_n_m` is the factorial of `n-m`, and `inverse_of(fact_n_m)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact_n_m` modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function returns `ways`. 

Potential edge cases include when `n` or `m` are outside their specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n). However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases; it assumes valid inputs. If `n` or `m` are invalid, the behavior of the function is undefined, possibly leading to errors due to invalid arguments in the `func_1` calls or incorrect results due to invalid mathematical operations.

Missing functionality includes input validation to ensure `n` and `m` are within the specified range. Additionally, while the function calculates the required value, it does not provide any information about the intermediate results such as the factorials or the modular multiplicative inverse, which could be useful for debugging or understanding the calculation process.
