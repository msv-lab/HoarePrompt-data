The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers. `n` represents the number of seats (with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), and `m` represents the number of passengers (with a constraint of 1 ≤ m ≤ n). The function returns `ways`, which is calculated as (2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) modulo (10^9 + 7).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and return `ways` calculated as (2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) modulo (10^9 + 7).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, and returns `ways` calculated as (2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m)) modulo (10^9 + 7).**
