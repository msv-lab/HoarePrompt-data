Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`. This means the loop condition is `2 <= i <= n`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `result` is updated to `result * 4 % MOD`.
   - `i` is 4.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range `2 <= i <= n`.
   - Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 5 (the next integer in the range).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 5.
   - The value of `n` does not change based on the given information, so it remains as it was before the last iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `result` is still `result * 4 % MOD` from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`result` is updated to `result * 4 % MOD`, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
