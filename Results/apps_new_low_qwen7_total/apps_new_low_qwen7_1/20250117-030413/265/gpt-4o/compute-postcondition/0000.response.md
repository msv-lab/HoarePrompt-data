Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of seats, m is an integer representing the number of passengers, MOD is a constant integer equal to 10^9 + 7, fact_n is the factorial of n modulo MOD, fact_n_m is the factorial of (n - m) modulo MOD, ways is the result of (2^m * fact_n * inverse_of(fact_n_m) modulo MOD), where inverse_of(fact_n_m) is the modular multiplicative inverse of fact_n_m under MOD**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `fact_n`, which is the factorial of `n` modulo `MOD`.
- The second line calculates `fact_n_m`, which is the factorial of `(n - m)` modulo `MOD`.
- The third line calculates `ways` using the formula given. It computes `2^m % MOD`, multiplies it by `fact_n`, then multiplies the result by the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact_n_m` under `MOD`, and finally takes the result modulo `MOD`.

The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, while `MOD` is also unchanged. The new variables `fact_n` and `fact_n_m` are introduced, and `ways` is calculated based on the provided formula.
