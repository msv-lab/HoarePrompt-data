Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the value of \((2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) \% (10^9 + 7)\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each integer within this range and taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. This ensures that the final result is always within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. The function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by returning 1, as the product of integers starting from 2 up to a number less than 2 is not defined in the problem statement.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0 or 1, the function should return 1 since the product of integers starting from 2 up to these values is not defined, and the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is 1 in both cases. However, the provided code only starts the loop from 2, meaning it will return 1 for `n` values of 0 or 1 without explicitly handling these cases.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or 1 explicitly. It should return 1 for these cases to align with the mathematical definition of the product.
