The code updates the `result` variable by multiplying it with `i` (which is 5) and then taking modulo `MOD`. The original `result` is also updated to `result * 4 % MOD`. Given that `i` is 5, the new value of `result` becomes `result * 5 % MOD`.

Since `result` was previously updated to `result * 4 % MOD`, the new value of `result` will be `(result * 4 % MOD) * 5 % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`result` is (`result * 4 % MOD`) * 5 % MOD, `i` is 5**
