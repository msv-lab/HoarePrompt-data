The function processes a genome represented by an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \). The function checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in \( s \). If any of these counts exceed \( n/4 \), it prints '===' and returns. If all counts are valid, it replaces the '?' characters in \( s \) with the most underrepresented nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') until each nucleotide appears exactly \( n/4 \) times. Finally, it prints the modified string. If the function completes without printing '===', it implicitly returns `None`.
