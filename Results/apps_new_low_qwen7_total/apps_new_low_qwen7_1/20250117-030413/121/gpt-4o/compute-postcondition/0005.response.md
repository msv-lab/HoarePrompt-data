Output State: **n is an integer divisible by 4, s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', target_count is n // 4, counts is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values all set to 0**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `target_count` as `n // 4`. This means that `target_count` will be the integer division of `n` by 4.
- The second line initializes a dictionary `counts` with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and sets their values to 0. This dictionary keeps track of the counts of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`.
- No changes were made to the variables `n` or `s` within the provided code block.
- Therefore, the final state includes the updated `target_count` and the initialized `counts` dictionary, while `n` and `s` retain their initial values.
