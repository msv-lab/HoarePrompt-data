Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is one of the characters from `counts` and appears `target_count` times, `counts` is a dictionary where each key has a count of `target_count`, and `target_count` is a constant. If `result[i]` is `?`, `result[i]` is replaced with a character from `counts`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
