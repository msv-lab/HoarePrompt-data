Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 'A', and `counts` is a dictionary with at least one key such that the count of 'A' is 2. If the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, the count of `char` in `counts` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `counts`.***
