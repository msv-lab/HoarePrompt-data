Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`, `counts` must contain at least one key. If `counts[char] < target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
