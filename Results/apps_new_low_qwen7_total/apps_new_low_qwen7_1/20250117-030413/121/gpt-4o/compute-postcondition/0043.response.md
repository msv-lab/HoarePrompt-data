Postcondition: ***`i` is either 1 or 0, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result[0]` is either `char` or `'?'`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 and `i` is set to 1. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then `i` remains 0.***
