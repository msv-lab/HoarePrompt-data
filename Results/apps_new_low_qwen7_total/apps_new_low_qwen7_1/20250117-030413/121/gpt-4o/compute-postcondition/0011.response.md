`counts[char]` is updated by adding 1 to the current value of `counts['a']`. Since `char` is 'a', this operation modifies `counts['a']`. If 'a' was already in `counts`, its value is incremented by 1. If 'a' was not in `counts`, it is added with a value of 1. In both cases, the value of `char` remains 'a', and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.

Output State: **`char` is 'a', `counts['a']` is incremented by 1 if 'a' was already in `counts`, otherwise `counts['a']` is set to 1**
