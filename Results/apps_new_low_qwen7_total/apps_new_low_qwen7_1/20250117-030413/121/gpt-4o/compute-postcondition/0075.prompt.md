You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n representing the length of the genome (4 ≤ n ≤ 255), and the second line contains a string s of length n representing the coded genome, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer, s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and n is divisible by 4
    target_count = n // 4

counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is still an integer divisible by 4, s remains the same string, target_count is still n // 4, and counts is a dictionary where each key 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' has a value equal to the number of occurrences of that character in s.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The function returns `None` if none of the values in `counts` exceed `target_count`. If any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately upon encountering such a value.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character key ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the `counts` dictionary. For each key, it checks if the count of that character exceeds `target_count`.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `n` remains constant as it is only used to define `target_count` and is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `s` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `target_count` remains constant as it is only defined once and is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `counts` may change its internal values during the iteration, but the keys remain the same.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute exactly once for each key in the `counts` dictionary. It prints '===' and returns `None` as soon as it finds a character count that exceeds `target_count`. If no character count exceeds `target_count`, the loop completes without returning anything, and the function implicitly returns `None`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The conditions for the loop to execute are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. If any count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately, and if no count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` after the loop completes.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is one of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and appears exactly `target_count` times, `counts` is a dictionary where the keys are 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and each key has a count of `target_count`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes the genome represented by an integer `n` and a string `s` without returning any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: None

Case_2: None

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: None


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
