The given code reads input from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts the first part to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. It then assigns the second part to `s`. Since there is no explicit output or further modification of variables within the provided code snippet, the only changes are the assignment of `n` and `s`.

Given the initial state:
- No input parameters are provided initially.
- `n` is not defined.
- `s` is not defined.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the integer value of the first part of the input.
- `s` is assigned the string value of the second part of the input.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
