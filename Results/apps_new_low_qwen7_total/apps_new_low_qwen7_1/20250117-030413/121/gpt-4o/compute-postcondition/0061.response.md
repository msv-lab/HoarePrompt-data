Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer and its value is one more than its previous value, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`, `counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all counts is `n` and each key has a count that is less than or equal to `target_count`, and `counts` must have at least one key. The current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
