The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the value of `counts[char]` by 1. Since `char` is an element of the `counts` dictionary, the value of `counts[char]` will be increased by 1. All other variables retain their values from the precondition.

Output State: **`char` is in `counts`, `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `char` is an element of the `counts` dictionary, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**
