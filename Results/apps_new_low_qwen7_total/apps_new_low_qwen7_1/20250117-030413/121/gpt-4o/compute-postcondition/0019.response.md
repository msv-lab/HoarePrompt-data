The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. For the current character `char`, the value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`. The string '===' is printed to the console.**
