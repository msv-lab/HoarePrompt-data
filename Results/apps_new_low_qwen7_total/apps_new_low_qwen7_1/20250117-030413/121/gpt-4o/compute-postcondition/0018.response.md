Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. For the current character `char`, the value of `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`***
