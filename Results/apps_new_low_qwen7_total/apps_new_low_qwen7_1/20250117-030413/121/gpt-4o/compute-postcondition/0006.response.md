Let's break down the task step-by-step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `char` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute at least once is that the string `s` must have at least one character.

3. **Initial Values**: 
   - `n` is an integer divisible by 4.
   - `s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
   - `target_count` is `n // 4`.
   - `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values all set to 0.

4. **State Before the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to start its first iteration, the string `s` must have at least one character. Since `s` consists of valid characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'), we just need to ensure that `s` is non-empty.
   - The values of `n`, `target_count`, and `counts` do not directly control whether the loop starts, but they are part of the initial state.

Given this analysis, the state of the object `s` must be such that it contains at least one character for the loop to execute the first time.

**State:**
**`s` must contain at least one character**
