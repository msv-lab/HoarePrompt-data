The function `func_1` does not accept any input parameters directly. Instead, the input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` representing the length of the genome (4 ≤ n ≤ 255), and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` representing the coded genome, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

Since the function does not return anything in the provided cases, the return value is `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the genome represented by the integer `n` and the string `s` without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function processes the genome represented by an integer `n` and a string `s` without returning any value.**
