Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the dictionary are less than or equal to `target_count`.**
