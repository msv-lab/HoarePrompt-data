Functionality: **The function processes a genome represented by an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \). The function checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in \( s \). If any of these counts exceed \( n/4 \), it prints '===' and returns. If all counts are valid, it replaces the '?' characters in \( s \) with the most underrepresented nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') until each nucleotide appears exactly \( n/4 \) times. Finally, it prints the modified string. If the function completes without printing '===', it implicitly returns `None`.**

**Edge Cases:**
1. If \( n \) is not divisible by 4, the function prints '===' and returns immediately.
2. If any nucleotide count exceeds \( n/4 \), the function prints '===' and returns immediately.
3. If all nucleotide counts are valid, the function proceeds to replace '?' characters. If there are multiple underrepresented nucleotides, the function arbitrarily chooses one to replace the '?' characters with, ensuring that the final string has each nucleotide appearing exactly \( n/4 \) times.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where \( n \) is less than 4. While the code allows \( n \geq 4 \), the initial annotation mentions \( 4 \leq n \leq 255 \), implying that the function should check for this constraint. If \( n < 4 \), the function should print '===' and return, as the conditions specified in the problem statement cannot be met.
