The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `s`. Therefore, the only change is the output printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and the current value of `n` is not divisible by 4; Console prints '==='**
