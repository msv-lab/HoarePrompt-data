Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`, `counts` is a dictionary containing at least one key and at least one key satisfies `counts[char] < target_count`. If `counts[char] < target_count`, the loop is broken; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
