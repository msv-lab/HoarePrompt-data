Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the count of `char` is updated. If `counts[char] < target_count`, then `result` is initialized as `['a']`, `counts` is updated such that `counts[char]` becomes `target_count`, and `i` is set to `0`. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then no changes are made to `result`, `counts`, and `i`.***
