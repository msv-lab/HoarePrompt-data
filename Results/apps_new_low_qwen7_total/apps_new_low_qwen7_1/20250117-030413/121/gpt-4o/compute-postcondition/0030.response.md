Output State: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The function returns `None` if none of the values in `counts` exceed `target_count`. If any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately upon encountering such a value.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character key ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the `counts` dictionary. For each key, it checks if the count of that character exceeds `target_count`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `n` remains constant as it is only used to define `target_count` and is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `target_count` remains constant as it is only defined once and is not modified within the loop.
   - `counts` may change its internal values during the iteration, but the keys remain the same.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute exactly once for each key in the `counts` dictionary. It prints '===' and returns `None` as soon as it finds a character count that exceeds `target_count`. If no character count exceeds `target_count`, the loop completes without returning anything, and the function implicitly returns `None`.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The conditions for the loop to execute are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. If any count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately, and if no count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
