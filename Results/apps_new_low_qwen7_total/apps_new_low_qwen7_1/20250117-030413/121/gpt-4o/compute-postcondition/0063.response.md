Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer and its value is one more than its previous value, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` with one element set to `char` at index `i`, `counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all counts is `n` and each key has a count that is less than or equal to `target_count`, and if `counts[char]` was less than `target_count`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `result` and `counts` remains unchanged.***
