Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0.
- `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`.
- `counts[char]` is updated accordingly (though this detail is not directly relevant to the loop initialization).

### For Loop:
```python
for char in counts:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `char`**: The loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `counts`. Therefore, the first iteration of the loop requires that `counts` is not empty and contains at least one key.

2. **Variable `i` and `n`**: Since `i` is initially set to `n` and the loop does not directly use `i`, we don't need to worry about the value of `i` for the first iteration of the loop. However, `n` must still satisfy its conditions: it must be an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0.

3. **List `result`**: The length of `result` is `n`, and each element is either `char` or `'?'`. This list is not directly used in the loop itself, but its length must match `n`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the dictionary `counts` must contain at least one key.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`, `counts` must contain at least one key**.
