Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `char` or `'?'`, and `counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all counts is `n` and each key has a count that is less than or equal to `target_count`. The function ensures that the loop continues to update `result` and `counts` until `counts` contains no more keys with `counts[char] < target_count`. If `result[i]` is `'?.'`, the loop updates `result` and `counts` accordingly; if `result[i]` is not `'?.'`, the function does not perform any additional updates.***
