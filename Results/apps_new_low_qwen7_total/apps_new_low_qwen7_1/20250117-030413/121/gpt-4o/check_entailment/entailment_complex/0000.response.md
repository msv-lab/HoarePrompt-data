Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input and splits it into `n` and `s`.
2. It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns, which is the correct behavior.
3. It calculates the target count (`target_count = n // 4`) and initializes a dictionary to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
4. It iterates over the string `s` to count the occurrences of each nucleotide. This part is correct.
5. After counting, it checks if any nucleotide count exceeds `target_count`. If so, it prints "===" and returns, which is the correct behavior.
6. If all counts are valid, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters with the most underrepresented nucleotide. This ensures that each nucleotide type ends up with the correct count.
7. Finally, it prints the modified string, which is the desired output.

Given the steps and the logic implemented, the function correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
