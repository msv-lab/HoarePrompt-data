You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n representing the length of the genome (4 ≤ n ≤ 255), and the second line contains a string s of length n representing the coded genome, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer, s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and n is divisible by 4
    target_count = n // 4

counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is still an integer divisible by 4, s remains the same string, target_count is still n // 4, and counts is a dictionary where each key 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' has a value equal to the number of occurrences of that character in s.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The function returns `None` if none of the values in `counts` exceed `target_count`. If any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately upon encountering such a value.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character key ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the `counts` dictionary. For each key, it checks if the count of that character exceeds `target_count`.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `n` remains constant as it is only used to define `target_count` and is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `s` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `target_count` remains constant as it is only defined once and is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `counts` may change its internal values during the iteration, but the keys remain the same.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute exactly once for each key in the `counts` dictionary. It prints '===' and returns `None` as soon as it finds a character count that exceeds `target_count`. If no character count exceeds `target_count`, the loop completes without returning anything, and the function implicitly returns `None`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: The conditions for the loop to execute are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. If any count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` immediately, and if no count exceeds `target_count`, the function returns `None` after the loop completes.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `result` is a list of length `n` where each element is one of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and appears exactly `target_count` times, `counts` is a dictionary where the keys are 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and each key has a count of `target_count`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a genome represented by an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \). The function checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in \( s \). If any of these counts exceed \( n/4 \), it prints '===' and returns. If all counts are valid, it replaces the '?' characters in \( s \) with the most underrepresented nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') until each nucleotide appears exactly \( n/4 \) times. Finally, it prints the modified string. If the function completes without printing '===', it implicitly returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input as a single string using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling large inputs.
2. It then splits the input into `n` and `s` and checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct based on the problem statement.
3. It calculates the target count of each nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
4. It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the current counts of each nucleotide.
5. It iterates through the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
6. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct.
7. If all nucleotides are within the target count, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters. It ensures that the nucleotides are replaced in such a way that the final counts match the target count.
8. The program constructs the result string by iterating through `s` again and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide.
9. Finally, it prints the constructed result string.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
