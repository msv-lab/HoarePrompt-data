### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into `n` and `s`. This is a valid approach for handling large inputs, ensuring that the entire input is read efficiently.

2. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Target Count Calculation**:
   - The target count is calculated as `target_count = n // 4`, which is the expected number of each nucleotide in the genome.

4. **Counting Nucleotides**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. This is done correctly using the `counts` dictionary.

5. **Validation of Counts**:
   - The program checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct.

6. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - If all nucleotides are within the target count, the program replaces the '?' characters. However, there is a potential issue here:
     - The inner loop (`for char in counts`) is designed to find the first nucleotide that has a count less than `target_count`. If it finds such a nucleotide, it replaces the '?' with that nucleotide and increments the count. This logic might not always ensure that the final counts are exactly equal to `target_count`.
     - Consider the case where `s = "A???GTTT"`. The counts will be: `{'A': 1, 'C': 0, 'G': 1, 'T': 3}`. The program will replace the first '? with 'C' and the next '?' with 'A', resulting in `s = "A?C?GTTT"`. Then it will replace the last two '?' with 'T', resulting in `s = "A?CATTTT"`. This is incorrect because the final counts will be `{'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 4}`, which does not satisfy the condition that each nucleotide should appear exactly `n//4` times.

7. **Constructing the Result String**:
   - The program constructs the result string by iterating through `s` again and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide. However, due to the issues mentioned above, this step might not produce a valid result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. However, the logic for replacing '?' characters does not guarantee that the final counts of each nucleotide will be exactly `n//4`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
