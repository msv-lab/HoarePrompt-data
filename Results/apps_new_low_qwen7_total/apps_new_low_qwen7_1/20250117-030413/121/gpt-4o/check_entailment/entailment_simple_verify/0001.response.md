### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into `n` and `s`.
   - It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - It calculates the target count of each nucleotide as `target_count = n // 4`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the current counts of each nucleotide.
   - It iterates through the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

3. **Validation Check:**
   - It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct.

4. **Replacement Logic:**
   - If all nucleotides are within the target count, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters.
   - It ensures that the nucleotides are replaced in such a way that the final counts match the target count.
   - The program constructs the result string by iterating through `s` again and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide.
   - This is achieved by ensuring that each time a '?' is replaced, the corresponding count in the `counts` dictionary is incremented until it reaches the target count.

5. **Final Output:**
   - It prints the constructed result string.

### Evaluation:

The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the program's behavior at key points, and the reasoning aligns well with the problem statement and the provided examples. The program correctly handles the input, validates the counts, and ensures that the final counts of each nucleotide match the target count.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the implementation steps, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct and implements the required logic accurately.
