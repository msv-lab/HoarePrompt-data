Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to decode the genome based on the given problem description and execution summary. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into two parts: the length of the genome (`n`) and the genome string (`s`). This matches the expected input format.
   
2. **Checking Divisibility**: The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns immediately. This handles the case where the number of nucleotides cannot be evenly divided among the four types.

3. **Counting Nucleotides**: It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`. If any count exceeds `n / 4`, it prints '===' and returns. This ensures that no type has more than its fair share before attempting to decode the genome.

4. **Replacing '?' Characters**: For each '?' character in the string `s`, the program replaces it with the least frequent nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') that still allows each type to appear exactly `n / 4` times. This ensures that after replacement, each nucleotide appears exactly `n / 4` times.

5. **Printing the Result**: After processing, the program prints the modified string. If the function completes without printing '===', it implies that the genome could be successfully decoded.

Given this analysis, the program correctly follows the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
