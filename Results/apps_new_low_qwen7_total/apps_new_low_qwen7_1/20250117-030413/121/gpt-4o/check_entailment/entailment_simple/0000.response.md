### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State and Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the input and splits it into two parts: `n` and `s`.
   - It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns, indicating the genome cannot be decoded.

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - It calculates the target count (`target_count`) as `n // 4`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the number of each type of nucleotide in `s`.

3. **Validation**:
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and updates the count in `counts`.
   - It then checks if any nucleotide count exceeds `target_count`. If so, it prints '===' and returns, indicating the genome cannot be decoded.

4. **Decoding**:
   - If the validation passes, it initializes `result` as a list of characters from `s`.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and replaces '?' with the appropriate nucleotide to balance the counts.
   - It ensures that each nucleotide appears exactly `target_count` times in the final string.

5. **Output**:
   - It joins the `result` list back into a string and prints it.

### Verification:
- The code handles all cases where the genome can be decoded correctly and where it cannot.
- The logic ensures that if the genome can be decoded, each nucleotide will appear exactly `n // 4` times.
- The code correctly handles the presence of '?' and ensures that the final string meets the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the problem description and logic.

**Correctness: **True**
