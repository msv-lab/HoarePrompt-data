### Reasoning

1. **Input Reading and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the input as a single string using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling large inputs.
   - It splits the input into `n` and `s` and checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct based on the problem statement.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**:
   - The program correctly calculates the target count of each nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
   - It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the current counts of each nucleotide.
   - It iterates through the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that the initial counts are accurately calculated.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - The program checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct.
   - This check ensures that if the initial counts are not balanced, the program will terminate early, preventing further processing.

4. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` again and replaces '?' with the most underrepresented nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') until each nucleotide appears exactly `n/4` times.
   - This replacement logic is correct and ensures that the final counts of each nucleotide match the target count.

5. **Constructing the Result String**:
   - The program constructs the result string by iterating through `s` and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide.
   - The final string is printed, which is the correct output format.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program handles all edge cases, including invalid input lengths and unbalanced nucleotide counts, by printing `===` appropriately. The replacement logic ensures that the final counts of each nucleotide match the target count.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
