Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the number of unrecognized nucleotides ('?') cannot be evenly distributed among the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). Specifically, the program does not check if the difference between the current count of each nucleotide and the target count can be balanced by the remaining '?' characters. 

For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
8
AG?C?CT?
```

The program will output `AGACCTCT`, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that the number of each nucleotide is exactly `n/4`. In this case, the target count for each nucleotide is 2, but the current counts are: `A: 2`, `C: 3`, `G: 1`, `T: 1`. There are no remaining '?' characters that can be used to balance the counts to make them all equal. Therefore, the program should output `"==="` for this case, but it does not.
