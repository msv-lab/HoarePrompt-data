Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input as a single string using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a valid approach for handling large inputs.
2. It then splits the input into `n` and `s` and checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct based on the problem statement.
3. It calculates the target count of each nucleotide (`target_count = n // 4`).
4. It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the current counts of each nucleotide.
5. It iterates through the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
6. It checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `===` and returns, which is correct.
7. If all nucleotides are within the target count, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters. It ensures that the nucleotides are replaced in such a way that the final counts match the target count.
8. The program constructs the result string by iterating through `s` again and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide.
9. Finally, it prints the constructed result string.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
