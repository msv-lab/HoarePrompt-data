The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the `continue` statement does not change any variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the same as `count_vk`, and `s_new` is `s`.**
