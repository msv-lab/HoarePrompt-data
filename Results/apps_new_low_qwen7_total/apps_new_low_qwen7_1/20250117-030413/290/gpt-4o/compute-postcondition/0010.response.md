Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` (which is `s[2]`) is 'V' and the character at index `i + 1` (which is `s[3]`) is 'K', then `count_vk` is 3. Otherwise, `count_vk` remains 2.***
