Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is the same as `count_vk`.
   - `s_new` is `s`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
   ```

3. Let's analyze what this code does:
   - It creates a new string `s_new` by taking the substring of `s` from the start up to index `i`, appending 'V', and then appending the rest of `s` starting from index `i + 1`.

4. The values of the variables before and after the code execution are:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `max_vk` remains unchanged.
   - `new_count_vk` remains unchanged.
   - `s_new` is now updated to the new string created by the code.

5. Therefore, the updated states are:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is the same as `count_vk`.
   - `s_new` is the new string obtained by inserting 'V' at index `i` in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2; `i` is `len(s) - 2`; `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`; `new_count_vk` is the same as `count_vk`; `s_new` is the new string obtained by inserting 'V' at index `i` in `s`.**
