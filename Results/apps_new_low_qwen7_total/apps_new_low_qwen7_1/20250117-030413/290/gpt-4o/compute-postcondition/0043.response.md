Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is 0.

2. **Loop Header:**
   ```python
   for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Header:**
   - The loop header involves the variable `j`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the condition `len(s_new) - 1 > 0` holds true.
   - Since `len(s_new)` is the length of the string `s_new`, the loop will execute as long as `len(s_new) > 1`.

5. **State Requirements for the First Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1.
   - Since `s_new` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `s_new` is derived from `s` (though this is not specified, we need to consider the implications).

Given the above points, the key requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `len(s_new) > 1`.

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `s` is a string of length at least 2, so `len(s) >= 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` being `len(s) - 1` means `i` is at least 1.
   - `s_new` must be a string derived from `s` such that `len(s_new) > 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 0, and `s_new` must be a string such that `len(s_new) > 1`.**
