The code `max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)` updates the value of `max_vk` to be the maximum of its current value and `new_count_vk`. The previous value of `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of 'VK' in `s`. Since `new_count_vk` is updated before this line of code, it remains unchanged. The value of `max_vk` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `new_count_vk`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of 'VK' in `s`.**
