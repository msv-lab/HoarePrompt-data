Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`. If the last character of `s` is 'V', `s` is updated to `s[:-1] + 'K'`, `count_vk` is updated according to the new count, and `max_vk` is updated accordingly. If the last character of `s` is 'K', `count_vk` is decremented by 1 if the last two characters of `s` were 'VK', otherwise `count_vk` remains unchanged, and `max_vk` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new `count_vk`.**
