The code `new_count_vk += 1` increments the value of `new_count_vk` by 1. Given that `new_count_vk` is initially 1 if the substring "VK" is found starting from index `j`, and since `j` is 2, `new_count_vk` will be incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 2, `s_new` remains unchanged as `s`, and `j` is 2.**
