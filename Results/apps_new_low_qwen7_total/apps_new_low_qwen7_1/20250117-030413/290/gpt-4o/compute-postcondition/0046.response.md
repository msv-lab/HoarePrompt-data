Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1 if the condition `s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` holds true for some index `j`, and `new_count_vk` remains 0 otherwise, `s_new` is a string such that `len(s_new) > 1`.***
