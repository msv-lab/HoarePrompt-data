The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code, and the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`, and `s[i]` is not equal to 'K', `i` must be less than `len(s)`**
