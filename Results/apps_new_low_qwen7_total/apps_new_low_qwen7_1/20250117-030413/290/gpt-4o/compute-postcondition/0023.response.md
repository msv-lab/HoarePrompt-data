The code initializes `new_count_vk` to 0. This does not affect the value of `s`, `i`, `count_vk`, or `max_vk`. Therefore, the only changes are that `new_count_vk` is set to 0, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2; `i` is `len(s) - 2`; `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`; `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`; `new_count_vk` is 0.**
