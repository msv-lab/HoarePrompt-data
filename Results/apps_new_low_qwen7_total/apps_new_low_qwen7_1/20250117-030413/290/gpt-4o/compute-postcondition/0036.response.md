Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `new_count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of 'VK' in `s`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `len(s)`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `len(s) - 1`.

4. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `count_vk`, `max_vk`, and `new_count_vk` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the substring 'VK' being checked at each position.
   - Since these values are not updated within the loop head, they remain the same for the next iteration.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `len(s) - 1`.
   - `count_vk`, `max_vk`, and `new_count_vk` remain unchanged.

So, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of 'VK' in `s`.**
