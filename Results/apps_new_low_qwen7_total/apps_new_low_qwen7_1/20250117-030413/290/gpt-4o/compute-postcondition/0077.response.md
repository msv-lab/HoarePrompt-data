Functionality: **The function `func()` takes a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" and returns the maximum number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' that can be achieved by replacing any 'V' with 'K' or any 'K' with 'V' in `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s`, considering each character as a potential starting point for a transformation. For each character, it generates a new string where the character is replaced and then counts the occurrences of 'VK' in this new string. It keeps track of the maximum count of 'VK' encountered during these transformations. The final result printed is the highest count of 'VK' observed.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input string `s` consists entirely of 'V' or 'K', the function will still iterate through each character, but no 'VK' substring will be formed since no 'V' will be replaced by 'K' or vice versa. In such cases, the maximum count of 'VK' will be 0.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., strings containing characters other than 'V' and 'K'). If such a case occurs, the function will still attempt to process the string, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- The function assumes that the input string `s` has a length between 1 and 100. If the input string is shorter than 2 characters, the function will still run but will not find any 'VK' substrings, leading to a count of 0.
