Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`. If the substring 'VK' is found at position `(j, j+1)` in `s`, `new_count_vk` is set to 2; otherwise, `new_count_vk` remains unchanged.***
