The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of 'VK' in `s`.**
