Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range` function.
   - The length of the string `s` is used as the upper bound of the range.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue as long as `i < len(s) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0, and `len(s) - 1` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `len(s)` must be greater than 1).

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `s` is an input string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   - `count_vk` is 0 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition but will be updated inside the loop body).

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `len(s)` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < len(s) - 1`).
   - Therefore, `len(s)` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **State of the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `len(s)` should be greater than or equal to 2.

Given the above points, we can summarize the required state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time:

State: **`s` is an input string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0, `count_vk` is 0**
