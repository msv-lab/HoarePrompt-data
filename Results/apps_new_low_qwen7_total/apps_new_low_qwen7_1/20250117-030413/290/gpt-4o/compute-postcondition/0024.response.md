Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information
- `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
- `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
- `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
- `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`.
- `new_count_vk` is 0.

### For Loop Details
The for loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop variable `j` is being initialized in the loop header and iterates from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`.

2. **Variable `s_new`**: Since `s_new` is not defined in the given information, we assume it is a reference to `s` (as no other variable is mentioned).

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(len(s_new) - 1)`, which means `j` will iterate from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be `0`.
- The value of `len(s_new)` must be at least `2` because `j` should be within the valid range (from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`).

### State Requirements
- Since `s_new` is assumed to be `s`, `len(s)` must be at least `2`.
- `j` must be `0` for the loop to execute the first time.
- No direct impact on `count_vk`, `max_vk`, or `new_count_vk` for the loop to start executing, but these variables must retain their initial values for subsequent iterations.

### Final State
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 0, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 0.**

This ensures that the loop can execute the first time with `j` set to `0`.
