The code `new_count_vk += 1` increments the value of `new_count_vk` by 1. Initially, `new_count_vk` is 0, so after this operation, `new_count_vk` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 0, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1, `s_new` is a new version of `s` where `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'**
