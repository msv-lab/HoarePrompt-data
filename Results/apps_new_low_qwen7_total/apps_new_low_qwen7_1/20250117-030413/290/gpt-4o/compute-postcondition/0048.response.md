The code `new_count_vk += 1` increments the value of `new_count_vk` by 1. Since `new_count_vk` was previously set to 1 (based on the initial state), incrementing it by 1 means `new_count_vk` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 2, `s_new` is a string such that `len(s_new) > 1` and `j` is 0**
