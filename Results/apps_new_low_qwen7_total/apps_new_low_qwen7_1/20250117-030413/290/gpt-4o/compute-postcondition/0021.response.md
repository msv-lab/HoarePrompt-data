Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2. `i` is `len(s) - 2`. `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`. `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`. If `s[i]` is 'K', `s` is updated to `s_new`, where `s_new` contains the modified string, `i` is `len(s_new) - 2`, and `count_vk` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is not 'K', `s` remains the original string, and `i` is `len(s) - 2`.***
