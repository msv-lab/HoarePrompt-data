Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2. `i` is `len(s) - 2`. `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`. `new_count_vk` is the same as `count_vk`. If `s[i]` is 'V', `s_new` is the string obtained by replacing 'V' at index `i` with 'K'. If `s[i]` is 'K', `s_new` is the string obtained by inserting 'V' at index `i` in `s`. Otherwise, `s_new` remains unchanged as `s`.***
