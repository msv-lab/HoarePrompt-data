The initial state is that the input is a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. The code snippet reads the input into `s` and initializes `count_vk` to 0.

After running the code block:

1. `s = input()` reads the input string into `s`.
2. `count_vk = 0` initializes `count_vk` to 0.

No further operations modify `s` or `count_vk`. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **s is an input string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive, count_vk is 0**
