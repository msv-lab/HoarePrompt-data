Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to adjust the states of the objects involved in the loop head: `j`.
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, the next value of `j` would be `2`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(s_new) - 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` is determined by `i = len(s) - 2`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `count_vk`, `max_vk`, and `new_count_vk` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`.

**State:**
**`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.**
