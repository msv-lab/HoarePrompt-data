Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable is `j`, and the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j`, `s_new`, and `new_count_vk`.

2. **Understand the Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is 1 if the condition `s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` holds true for some index `j`, and 0 otherwise.
   - `s_new` is a string such that `len(s_new) > 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - `j` will start from 0 and increment by 1 at each iteration until it reaches `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - `s_new` will remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is specified, we assume it stays the same.
   - `new_count_vk` will be set to 1 if the condition `s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` holds true for the new value of `j`, otherwise it will remain 0.

Since the only variables that can be adjusted are `j`, `s_new`, and `new_count_vk`, and considering the initial values and the logic of the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `new_count_vk` will either be 1 or 0 based on the condition being true or false for the new value of `j`.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1 if the condition `s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` holds true for the new value of `j` (which is 0 in the first iteration), and 0 otherwise, `s_new` is a string such that `len(s_new) > 1` and `j` is 0**.
