`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. Since `new_count_vk` was either 0 or 1 before this operation, now it becomes 1 or 2. The value of `i` remains `len(s) - 2`, `max_vk` remains the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`, `s_new` remains unchanged as `s`, and `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1 or 2, `s_new` remains unchanged as `s`, and `j` is 1.**
