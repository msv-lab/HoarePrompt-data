Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `len(s_new) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is 1 if the substring 'VK' is found at position `(j, j+1)` in `s`, otherwise `new_count_vk` remains 0.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration because the loop runs from `range(len(s_new) - 1)`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1 (since it was 0 in the previous iteration).
   - The length of `s_new` does not change within the loop, so `len(s_new) - 1` remains the same.

4. **Update the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since the loop runs from `range(len(s_new) - 1)`, the condition `j < len(s_new) - 1` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - Given that `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(s_new) - 1`.

5. **Consider the impact of the loop body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but it checks if the substring 'VK' is found at position `(j, j+1)` in `s`.
   - If 'VK' is found, `new_count_vk` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
   - `count_vk` and `max_vk` might change based on the value of `new_count_vk`.

Since we are only adjusting the states for the loop head and not considering the loop body's impact on `count_vk` and `max_vk` in this step-by-step analysis, we focus on `j` and `len(s_new) - 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1 if the substring 'VK' is found at position `(j, j+1)` in `s`, otherwise `new_count_vk` remains 0.**
