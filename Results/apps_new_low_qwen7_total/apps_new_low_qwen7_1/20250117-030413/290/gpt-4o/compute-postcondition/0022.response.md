Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2. `i` is `len(s) - 2`. `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`. `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`. After executing the if-else block, if `s[i]` is 'V', the character at index `i` is replaced with 'K', and `count_vk` is updated accordingly. If `s[i]` is 'K', `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is `len(s) - 2`.**
