`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The original value of `new_count_vk` is 2 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`, and 0 otherwise. After incrementing, `new_count_vk` will be 3 if it was initially 2, and 1 if it was initially 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of its previous value and the final `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1 or 3, `s_new` is a string such that `len(s_new) > 1` and `j` is 1.**
