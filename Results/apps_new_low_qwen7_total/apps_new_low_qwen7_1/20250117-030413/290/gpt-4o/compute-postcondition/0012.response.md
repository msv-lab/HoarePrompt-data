`max_vk` is assigned the value of `count_vk`. The value of `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `count_vk` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, and `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`**
