The code `new_count_vk += 1` increments the value of `new_count_vk` by 1. Since `new_count_vk` was initially set to 1 if the substring 'VK' is found at position `(j, j+1)` in `s`, and assuming this condition was met (because `j` is 1 and `i` is `len(s) - 2`, which means we are checking the first two characters of the string), `new_count_vk` would have been set to 1. Now, it is incremented by 1, making its new value 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length of at least 2, `j` is 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' in `s`, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 2.**
