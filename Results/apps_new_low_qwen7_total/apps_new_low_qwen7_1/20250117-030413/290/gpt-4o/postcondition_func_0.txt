The function `func()` takes a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" and returns the maximum number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' that can be achieved by replacing any 'V' with 'K' or any 'K' with 'V' in `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s`, considering each character as a potential starting point for a transformation. For each character, it generates a new string where the character is replaced and then counts the occurrences of 'VK' in this new string. It keeps track of the maximum count of 'VK' encountered during these transformations. The final result printed is the highest count of 'VK' observed.
