Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where changing a 'K' to a 'V' would result in multiple additional occurrences of "VK". Specifically, consider the input "KVKV". The program currently checks each character individually and changes it to the opposite, but it does not account for the possibility of creating additional "VK" substrings by changing a 'K' to a 'V'. 

For the input "KVKV":
- Changing the first 'K' to 'V' results in "VVKV", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the second 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the third 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the fourth 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".

The correct output should be 2, but the program outputs 1 because it does not consider the cumulative effect of changing a 'K' to a 'V'. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
