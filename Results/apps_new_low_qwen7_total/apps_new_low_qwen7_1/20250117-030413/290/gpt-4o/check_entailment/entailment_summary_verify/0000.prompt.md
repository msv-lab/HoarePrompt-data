You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Tonio has a keyboard with only two letters, "V" and "K".

One day, he has typed out a string s with only these two letters. He really likes it when the string "VK" appears, so he wishes to change at most one letter in the string (or do no changes) to maximize the number of occurrences of that string. Compute the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring (i. e. a letter "K" right after a letter "V") in the resulting string.


-----Input-----

The first line will contain a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with length not less than 1 and not greater than 100.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring of the given string after changing at most one character.


-----Examples-----
Input
VK

Output
1

Input
VV

Output
1

Input
V

Output
0

Input
VKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK

Output
3

Input
KVKV

Output
1



-----Note-----

For the first case, we do not change any letters. "VK" appears once, which is the maximum number of times it could appear.

For the second case, we can change the second character from a "V" to a "K". This will give us the string "VK". This has one occurrence of the string "VK" as a substring.

For the fourth case, we can change the fourth character from a "K" to a "V". This will give us the string "VKKVKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK". This has three occurrences of the string "VK" as a substring. We can check no other moves can give us strictly more occurrences.

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    count_vk = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K':
            count_vk += 1
    max_vk = count_vk
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'V':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]
        elif s[i] == 'K':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
        else:
            continue
        new_count_vk = 0
        for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
            if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':
                new_count_vk += 1
        max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)
    print(max_vk)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func()` takes a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" and returns the maximum number of occurrences of the substring 'VK' that can be achieved by replacing any 'V' with 'K' or any 'K' with 'V' in `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s`, considering each character as a potential starting point for a transformation. For each character, it generates a new string where the character is replaced and then counts the occurrences of 'VK' in this new string. It keeps track of the maximum count of 'VK' encountered during these transformations. The final result printed is the highest count of 'VK' observed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where changing a 'K' to a 'V' would result in multiple additional occurrences of "VK". Specifically, consider the input "KVKV". The program currently checks each character individually and changes it to the opposite, but it does not account for the possibility of creating additional "VK" substrings by changing a 'K' to a 'V'. 

For the input "KVKV":
- Changing the first 'K' to 'V' results in "VVKV", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the second 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the third 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".
- Changing the fourth 'K' to 'V' results in "KVVK", which has 1 occurrence of "VK".

The correct output should be 2, but the program outputs 1 because it does not consider the cumulative effect of changing a 'K' to a 'V'. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
