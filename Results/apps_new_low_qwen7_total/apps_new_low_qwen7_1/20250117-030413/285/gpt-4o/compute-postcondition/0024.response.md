Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `b` where `b` ranges from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

2. **Determine the initial values:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 123456.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `-b * 123456`.
   - `a` is `n // house_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `b` will increment by 1 at each iteration.
   - `remaining_after_cars` will change based on the value of `b`.

Given that `b` is the only variable that changes within the loop and it starts from `0`, we need to determine the new value of `b` and ensure that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` remains valid.

Since `b` increases by 1, let's denote the new value of `b` as `b + 1`. We need to check if this new value still satisfies the loop condition.

- **Initial value of `b`:** `b` (unknown, but starts from 0)
- **New value of `b`:** `b + 1`

For the loop to continue, the following conditions must hold true:
- `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be greater than or equal to `b + 1`.

Since `remaining_after_houses` is an integer, the new value of `remaining_after_houses` will remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body (which is omitted).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is `-b * 123456`, `a` is `n // house_cost`, `b` is `b + 1`, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`**
