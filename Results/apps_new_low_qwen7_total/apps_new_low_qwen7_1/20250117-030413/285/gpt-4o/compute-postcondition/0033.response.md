Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `a` in the range `n // house_cost + 1`.
   - This means `a` starts from 0 up to `n // house_cost`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `a` is `n // house_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is less than `car_cost`.
   - `b` is the number of iterations performed by the loop.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `a` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `a` should be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `a` was `n // house_cost` before the last iteration, it will be `n // house_cost + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the Remaining Conditions:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain unchanged.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is still less than `car_cost`.
   - `b` increases by 1 for each iteration.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `a` will be `n // house_cost + 1`.
- `b` will be `b + 1`.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `n // house_cost + 1`, `remaining_after_houses` is less than `car_cost`, `b` is `b + 1`**.
