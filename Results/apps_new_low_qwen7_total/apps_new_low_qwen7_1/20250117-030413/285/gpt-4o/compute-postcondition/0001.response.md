State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs based on the condition `a in range(n // house_cost + 1)`.
   - This means the loop starts when `a` is 0 and increments until `a` reaches `n // house_cost + 1`.

2. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `n` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` are fixed values (1234567, 123456, 1234 respectively).

3. **Loop Execution Criteria**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be 0.
   - The expression `n // house_cost + 1` determines the upper limit for `a`.
   - Since `a` starts at 0, the first iteration will occur if `0 <= n // house_cost`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n // house_cost` must be at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least `house_cost`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the initial state must satisfy the condition that `n` is greater than 0. The other variables (`house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
