Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b` and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is within the range `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - We need to determine the state of `b` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 and at least 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * 123456`.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not 0.

4. **Determine the value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`**:
   - Since `remaining_after_houses = n` and `car_cost = 123456`, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is `n // 123456`.
   - Therefore, the loop will run from `b = 0` to `b = n // 123456`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` must be less than `n // 123456` for the loop to continue.
   - Hence, `b` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Update the remaining states**:
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains `n`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` becomes `n - (b + 1) * 123456`.
   - `a` remains 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` should still be non-zero.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and at least 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - (b + 1) * 123456`, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not 0**
