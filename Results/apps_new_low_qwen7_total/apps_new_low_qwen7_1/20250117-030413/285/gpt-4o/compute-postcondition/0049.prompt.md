Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, house_cost is 1234567, car_cost is 123456, computer_cost is 1234
Code of the loop:
for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
    remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
    for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
        if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
            return 'YES'


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is 0, `a` is 0, the function returns 'YES'.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs for `b` in the range `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_after_cars` is updated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES' and stops executing further iterations.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain constant.
   - `remaining_after_houses` decreases by multiples of `car_cost` until it reaches 0.
   - `b` increments with each iteration.
   - `a` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to run as long as there are enough funds to buy cars (`remaining_after_houses >= car_cost * b`).
   - The loop terminates when `remaining_after_houses < car_cost * (b + 1)` or if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` at any point.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'YES', `remaining_after_houses` will be less than `car_cost`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The condition `remaining_after_houses % car_cost == 0` must hold true for `remaining_after_houses` to be reduced to 0.
   - When `remaining_after_houses` is a multiple of `car_cost`, the loop will keep reducing it until it hits 0.
   - Once `remaining_after_houses` is 0, the loop will exit, and since no further iterations can occur, the function returns 'YES'.

Thus, the final state of the variables is such that `remaining_after_houses` and `remaining_after_cars` are both 0, and the function returns 'YES'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is less than `car_cost`, `b` is the number of iterations performed by the loop, and the loop either returns `'YES'` or ends without returning anything.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`; `remaining_after_houses` is -123456; `b` is -1; `remaining_after_cars` is -123456.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
