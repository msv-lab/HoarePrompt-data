Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
   - `a` is 0.
   - The function returns 'YES'.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for `a` in the range `n // house_cost + 1`.
   - This means the loop will execute `(n // house_cost) + 1` times.

3. **Variable Changes**:
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain constant.
   - `a` increments with each iteration.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is not modified within the loop and remains 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not directly modified within the loop but is used in the condition to return 'YES'.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // house_cost`.
   - Since `remaining_after_houses` is 0, the value of `a` is what determines if the loop continues.

5. **Final State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `a` must be incremented from its initial value of 0 to reach the maximum number of iterations allowed by the loop.
   - The loop will continue until `a` equals `n // house_cost`.

Given this analysis, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Value of `a`**:
   - Initially, `a` is 0.
   - The loop will run until `a` equals `n // house_cost`.

2. **Calculate `n // house_cost`**:
   - Since `n` is a multiple of 123456 and `house_cost` is 1234567, `n // house_cost` will be an integer.
   - Let's denote `k = n // house_cost`.

3. **Final Value of `a` Before the Next Iteration**:
   - If `a` is currently 0, then the loop will run for `k` iterations.
   - After `k` iterations, `a` will be `k`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain unchanged.
   - `remaining_after_houses` and `remaining_after_cars` remain 0 as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `a` will be `n // house_cost`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` is 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
- `a` is `n // house_cost`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is 0, `a` is `n // house_cost`**.
