Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0 and at least 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * 123456`. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not change any of the variables' values.***
