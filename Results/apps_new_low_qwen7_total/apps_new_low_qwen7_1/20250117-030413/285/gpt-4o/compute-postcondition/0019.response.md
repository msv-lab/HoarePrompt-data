To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` is 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
- `a` is `n // house_cost`.
- `remaining_after_houses` is 0 (this seems redundant as it was already stated).

### For Loop Details:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs based on the value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
2. **Initialization of Variables**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` should be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **`remaining_after_houses`**: Since `remaining_after_houses` is initially set to 0, we need to consider how this value changes within the loop.
2. **`b` in the loop**: The loop variable `b` ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.

### Conclusion:
Since `remaining_after_houses` is 0 initially, the loop will not execute because `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` will be 0, making `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` equal to 1 but the loop will still not run as the range will be from 0 to 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is 0, `a` is `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is 0**
