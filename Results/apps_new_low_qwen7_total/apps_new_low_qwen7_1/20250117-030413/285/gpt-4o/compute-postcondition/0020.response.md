The initial state is defined as follows:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 123456.
- `remaining_after_cars` is 0.
- `a` is `n // house_cost`.
- `remaining_after_houses` is 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. `remaining_after_houses` is 0 (from the initial state).
2. The value of `b` is not defined in the initial state, so let's denote it as an arbitrary variable `b`.
3. The expression `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` simplifies to `0 - b * 123456`, which results in `-b * 123456`.

Since `remaining_after_houses` is 0, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `-b * 123456`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `b`, so we keep it as an arbitrary variable.

The output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `remaining_after_cars`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is `-b * 123456`, `a` is `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is 0**.
