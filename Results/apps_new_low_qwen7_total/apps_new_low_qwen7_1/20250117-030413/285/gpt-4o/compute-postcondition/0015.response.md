Postcondition: ***`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `car_cost` is unchanged. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything (or remains in an unspecified state as no other return value is provided).***
