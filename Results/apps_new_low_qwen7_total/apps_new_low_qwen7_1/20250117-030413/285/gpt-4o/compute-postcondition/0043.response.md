Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`, `remaining_after_houses` is -123456, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is -123456. If `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` equals 0, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no return value is specified (or the program continues execution as per the subsequent code).***
