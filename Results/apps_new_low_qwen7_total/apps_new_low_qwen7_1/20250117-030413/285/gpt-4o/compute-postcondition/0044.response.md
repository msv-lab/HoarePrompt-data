Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `b` and `remaining_after_houses`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `b` values from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is -123456.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is -123456.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - **`b`**: The loop increments `b` by 1 each iteration. Since `b` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `b` becomes 1.
   - **`remaining_after_houses`**: This variable does not change within the loop based on the given information. It remains `-123456`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is for the variable `b`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`, `remaining_after_houses` is -123456, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is -123456**.
