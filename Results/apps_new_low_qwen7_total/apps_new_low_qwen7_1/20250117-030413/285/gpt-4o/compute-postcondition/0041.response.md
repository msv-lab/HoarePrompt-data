The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`
- `remaining_after_houses` is -123456
- `b` is 0
- `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`

The code snippet is:
```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- `remaining_after_houses` is -123456
- `b` is 0, so `b * car_cost` is 0
- Subtracting 0 from `-123456` does not change its value.

Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` is updated to -123456.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`, `remaining_after_houses` is -123456, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is -123456**
