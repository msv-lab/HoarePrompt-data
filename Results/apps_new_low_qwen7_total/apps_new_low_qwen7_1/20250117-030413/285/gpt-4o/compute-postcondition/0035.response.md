Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `-123456`.
- `b` is in its initial state.

### For Loop:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variables**:
   - The loop control variable in this case is `b`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `b`**:
   - `b` is in its initial state, meaning it hasn't been assigned any value yet.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - Since `b` is initially undefined, we need to determine the value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` to understand when the loop can start.

4. **Value of `remaining_after_houses`**:
   - `remaining_after_houses` is given as `-123456`.

5. **Car Cost**:
   - `car_cost` is 123456.

6. **Calculating the Upper Bound**:
   - `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` simplifies to \(-123456 // 123456 + 1\).
   - \(-123456 // 123456\) results in \(-1\) because integer division of a negative number by a positive number gives the floor of the result.
   - Therefore, \(-1 + 1 = 0\).

So, the condition `b <= remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` simplifies to `b <= 0`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be assigned a value such that `b <= 0`. Since `b` is initially undefined, we need to assign it a value that satisfies this condition.

### Final State for the Loop Head:
- `n` remains an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456.
- `house_cost` remains 1234567.
- `car_cost` remains 123456.
- `computer_cost` remains 1234.
- `a` remains `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains \(-123456\).
- `b` must be initialized to a value that is less than or equal to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`, `remaining_after_houses` is \(-123456\), `b` is initialized to a value that is less than or equal to 0**
