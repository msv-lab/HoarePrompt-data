Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `a` is `n // house_cost`; `b` is `b + 1`; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning a specific value.***
