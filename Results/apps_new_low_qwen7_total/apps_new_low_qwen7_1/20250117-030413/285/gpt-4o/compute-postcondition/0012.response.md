Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `b` in the range `range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `b`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0 and at least 123456.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * 123456`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `b` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - We need to ensure `b` is still within the range specified by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

Given these points, let's calculate the new state:

- Since `b` is incremented by 1, the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
- We need to check if this new value of `b` is still within the range `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

To summarize, the only variable that needs to be updated is `b`.

**State:**
**`n` is an integer greater than 0 and at least 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - (b + 1) * 123456`**
