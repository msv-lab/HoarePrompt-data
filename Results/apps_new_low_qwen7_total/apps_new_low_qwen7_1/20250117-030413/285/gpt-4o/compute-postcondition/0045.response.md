`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given the initial state:
- `remaining_after_houses` is -123456
- `b` is 1
- `car_cost` is 123456

So, `remaining_after_cars` becomes `-123456 - 1 * 123456 = -123456 - 123456 = -246912`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `k + 1` where `n = 123456k`, `remaining_after_houses` is -123456, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is -246912**
