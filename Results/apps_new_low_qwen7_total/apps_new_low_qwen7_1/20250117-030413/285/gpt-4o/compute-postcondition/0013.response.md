The given code snippet is not a complete program and does not assign values to `remaining_after_houses` or `b`. It also does not assign a value to `car_cost`. Therefore, without specific values for these variables, the exact output state cannot be determined. However, we can state that `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `car_cost` is unchanged.**
