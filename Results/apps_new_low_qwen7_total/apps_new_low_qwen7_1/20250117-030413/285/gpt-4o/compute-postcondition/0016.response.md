Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is 0, `a` is 0, the function returns 'YES'.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs for `b` in the range `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_after_cars` is updated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES' and stops executing further iterations.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain constant.
   - `remaining_after_houses` decreases by multiples of `car_cost` until it reaches 0.
   - `b` increments with each iteration.
   - `a` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to run as long as there are enough funds to buy cars (`remaining_after_houses >= car_cost * b`).
   - The loop terminates when `remaining_after_houses < car_cost * (b + 1)` or if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` at any point.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'YES', `remaining_after_houses` will be less than `car_cost`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The condition `remaining_after_houses % car_cost == 0` must hold true for `remaining_after_houses` to be reduced to 0.
   - When `remaining_after_houses` is a multiple of `car_cost`, the loop will keep reducing it until it hits 0.
   - Once `remaining_after_houses` is 0, the loop will exit, and since no further iterations can occur, the function returns 'YES'.

Thus, the final state of the variables is such that `remaining_after_houses` and `remaining_after_cars` are both 0, and the function returns 'YES'.
