Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be purchased with the initial amount of game-coins `n`. Here is the breakdown:

1. The program correctly defines the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
2. It uses nested loops to iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`c`).
3. The innermost condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:` ensures that the remaining amount after purchasing houses and cars can be perfectly divided by the cost of a computer, which means no game-coins will be left unspent.
4. If such a combination is found, it immediately returns 'YES'.
5. If no valid combination is found after all iterations, it returns 'NO'.

Given these points, the logic implemented in the program correctly addresses the problem statement. Therefore, the program is designed to work as intended and should provide the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
