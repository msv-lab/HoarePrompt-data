Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The nested loops iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) to see if their costs sum up to `n`. 

For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after buying `a` houses and then iterates over possible values of `b` to calculate the remaining coins after buying `b` cars. If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, it means that it is possible to spend exactly `n` coins, and the function returns "YES".

If no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` allows the exact match, the function correctly returns "NO". The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
