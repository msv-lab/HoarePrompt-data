Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n)` to perform the necessary computations and prints the result.
3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), ensuring that `a * house_cost` does not exceed `n`.
   - For each value of `a`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses`).
   - The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`), ensuring that `b * car_cost` does not exceed the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars`).
   - If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means Kolya could have spent all his coins with this combination of purchases, and the function returns 'YES'.
4. **Return Value**: If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns 'NO'.

Given the logic, the program correctly checks all combinations of houses, cars, and computers to see if they sum up to `n`.

Correctness: **True**
