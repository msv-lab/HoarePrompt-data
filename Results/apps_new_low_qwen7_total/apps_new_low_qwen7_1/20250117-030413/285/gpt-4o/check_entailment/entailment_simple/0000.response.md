Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly sets up the variables for the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
2. It then iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses), for each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.
3. For each remaining amount after buying houses, it iterates over possible values of `b` (number of cars), calculating the remaining coins after buying `b` cars.
4. If the remaining coins after buying `b` cars is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`c`), it means Kolya could have spent all his initial coins by buying a combination of houses, cars, and computers.
5. If such a combination is found, the function returns `'YES'`.
6. If no such combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, the function returns `'NO'`.

Given that the logic checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers to see if they can exhaust the initial coin count `n`, the annotated program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
