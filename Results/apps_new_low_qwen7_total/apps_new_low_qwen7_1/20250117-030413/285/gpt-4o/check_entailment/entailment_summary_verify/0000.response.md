Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers to determine if Kolya could have spent exactly `n` game-coins. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the function summary:

1. **Input and Output Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, calls `func_1(n)`, and prints the result. This matches the expected input and output format.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`). It ensures that the remaining amount after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`). Here's a detailed step-by-step verification:

   - **Outer Loop**: `a` ranges from 0 to `n // house_cost`.
     - For each value of `a`, the program calculates the remaining amount after buying `a` houses: `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`.
   - **Middle Loop**: `b` ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
     - For each value of `b`, the program calculates the remaining amount after buying `b` cars: `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - **Inner Check**: If the remaining amount `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns "YES". This check ensures that the remaining amount can be exactly matched by buying the appropriate number of computers.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loops ensure that all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` are checked.
   - If no valid combination is found, the function returns "NO" after completing all iterations.

Given the function summary and the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The nested loops ensure that all combinations are considered, and the condition for divisibility ensures that the remaining amount can be exactly matched by computers.

Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate.
