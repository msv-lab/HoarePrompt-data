### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the given function summary and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is called, and the result is printed.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), ensuring that `a * house_cost` does not exceed `n`.
   - For each value of `a`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses`).
   - The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`), ensuring that `b * car_cost` does not exceed the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars`).
   - If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means Kolya could have spent all his coins with this combination of purchases, and the function returns 'YES'.
   - If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns 'NO'.

Given the logic, the program correctly checks all combinations of houses, cars, and computers to see if they sum up to `n`. The function summary aligns well with the implementation details. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies noted in the code that would lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic and its correctness. The program correctly implements the required functionality to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers.
