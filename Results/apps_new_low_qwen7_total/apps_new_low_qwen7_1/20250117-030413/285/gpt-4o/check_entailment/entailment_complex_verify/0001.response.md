### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, representing Kolya's initial game-coin score. This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. This is the core functionality of the program.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), ensuring that `a * house_cost` does not exceed `n`.
     ```python
     for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
         remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
     ```
   - For each value of `a`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses`).
   
   - The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`), ensuring that `b * car_cost` does not exceed the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses.
     ```python
     for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
         remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
     ```
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars`).
   
   - If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means Kolya could have spent all his coins with this combination of purchases, and the function returns 'YES'.
     ```python
     if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
         return 'YES'
     ```

4. **Return Value**:
   - If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns 'NO'.
     ```python
     return 'NO'
     ```

The nested loops ensure that all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers are checked. If any combination results in a remainder that is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer, the function correctly returns 'YES'. If no such combination exists, the function returns 'NO'. This approach exhaustively checks all possible ways to spend `n` game-coins using the given costs, ensuring the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
