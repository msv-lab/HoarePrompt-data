Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly initializes the costs of the houses, cars, and computers.
2. The nested loops iterate over all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers with the given constraints.
3. For each combination, it calculates the remaining amount after buying the houses and cars, and checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer.
4. If such a combination is found, the function immediately returns 'YES'.
5. If no valid combination is found after iterating through all possibilities, the function returns 'NO'.
6. The logic in the function correctly checks if it's possible to spend all of Kolya's initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

Given the above points, the function logic matches the problem statement and the provided example outputs are consistent with the function's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
