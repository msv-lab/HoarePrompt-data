### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and purpose of the provided program. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, representing Kolya's initial game-coin score.
   - This is correctly handled by `n = int(input().strip())`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n)` to determine if Kolya could have spent all his coins.
   - The result is then printed.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), ranging from 0 to `n // house_cost`.
   - For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`).
   - The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`), ranging from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`).
   - If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`), the function returns 'YES'.
   - If no valid combination is found, the function returns 'NO'.

The logic implemented in `func_1` ensures that all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers are checked to see if their total cost equals `n`. The nested loops effectively cover all scenarios where the cost of houses, cars, and computers can sum up to `n`.

The annotations provided also correctly describe the state of the program at key points, validating the logic described in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to check if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins by buying only houses, cars, and computers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
