You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

- Program: 
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567

car_cost = 123456

computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and a multiple of 123456, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, `b` is the number of iterations performed by the inner loop, and the function returns 'YES' if `remaining_after_houses` can be reduced to 0 by the inner loop and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`. Otherwise, the function returns nothing.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The nested loops iterate over possible numbers of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) to see if their costs sum up to `n`. 

For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining coins after buying `a` houses and then iterates over possible values of `b` to calculate the remaining coins after buying `b` cars. If the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, it means that it is possible to spend exactly `n` coins, and the function returns "YES".

If no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` allows the exact match, the function correctly returns "NO". The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
