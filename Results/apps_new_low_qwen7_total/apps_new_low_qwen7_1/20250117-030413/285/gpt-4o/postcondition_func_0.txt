The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be purchased with `n` units of currency, given their respective costs (`house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`). If it finds a combination where the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, after completing all iterations, it returns 'NO'.
