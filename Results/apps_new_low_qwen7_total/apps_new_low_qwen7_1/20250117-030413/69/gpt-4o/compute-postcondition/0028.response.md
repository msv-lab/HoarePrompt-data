`final_y` is decremented by 1. The second character of `operations` is assigned to `op`. The state of `operations` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string with at least 2 characters, `op` is the second character of `operations`, `final_y` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string with at least 2 characters, `op` is the second character of `operations`, `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
