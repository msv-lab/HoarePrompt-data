Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.

Code Snippet:
```
final_x = 0
final_y = 0
```

The code initializes two variables, `final_x` and `final_y`, to 0. It does not modify the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` and `operations` retain their initial values as well.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, operations is a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and x, y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, final_x is 0, final_y is 0**
