Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length greater than 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. In all cases, the state of `final_x` and `final_y` is adjusted according to the first character of `operations`, ensuring that if no specific action is taken (i.e., neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R'), their values remain unchanged from the original precondition.***
