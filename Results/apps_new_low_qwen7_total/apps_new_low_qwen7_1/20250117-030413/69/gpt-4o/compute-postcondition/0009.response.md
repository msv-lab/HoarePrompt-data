`final_x` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `operations` is a string of length greater than 0, and its first character is 'L' and not 'D'. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is decreased by 1, `operations` is a string of length greater than 0, and its first character is 'L' and not 'D'.**
