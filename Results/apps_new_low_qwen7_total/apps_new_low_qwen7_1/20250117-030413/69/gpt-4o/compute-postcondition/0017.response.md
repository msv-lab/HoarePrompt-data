Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `op`, which is an element from the string `operations`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `operations`.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operations` is a string of length greater than 0.
   - Based on the first character of `operations`, `final_y` and `final_x` are updated accordingly.

4. **Adjusting the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are characters left in `operations`, we need to ensure that `operations` still has characters left.
   - After the previous iteration, `operations` had at least one character. For the next iteration, `operations` must have at least two characters (since it must be able to process the next character).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `operations` must now be a string of length greater than 1.
   - `final_y` and `final_x` will be updated based on the new first character of `operations`.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 1, if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1.**
