Postcondition: ***`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the operation 'R' was performed, `current_y` remains 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` equals 'R', then `current_x` becomes 1. Otherwise, `current_x` remains 0.***
