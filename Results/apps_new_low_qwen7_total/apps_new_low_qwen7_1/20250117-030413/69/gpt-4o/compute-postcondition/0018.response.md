The code `final_y += 1` increases the value of `final_y` by 1. The initial condition states that if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1; if the first character is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if the first character is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1; if the first character is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. Since the code only affects `final_y`, and we know that initially, if the first character is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1, it implies that the first character is 'U'. Therefore, `final_y` is increased by 1 from its initial value.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 1, `final_x` is equal to the initial value of `final_x`, `final_y` is the initial value of `final_y` plus 1.**
