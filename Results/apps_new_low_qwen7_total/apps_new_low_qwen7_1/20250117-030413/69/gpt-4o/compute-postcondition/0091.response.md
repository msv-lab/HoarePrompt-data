Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). It calculates the net horizontal (`final_x`) and vertical (`final_y`) displacements based on the operations string. 

After calculating these displacements, it determines the relative positions `dx` and `dy` between the starting point (`x`, `y`) and the ending point of the operations sequence. If the starting point and ending point are the same (i.e., `dx == 0` and `dy == 0`), the function immediately returns 0.

Otherwise, it performs another traversal of the `operations` string while tracking visited positions using a dictionary (`position_map`). During this traversal, it checks if the target position (calculated as `current_x + dx` and `current_y + dy`) has been visited before. If a previously visited position leads to a shorter path to the target, it updates `min_length` accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum length of the path found (`min_length`), or -1 if no valid path is found.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is at its maximum value (2⋅10^5), the function will traverse up to 2⋅10^5 characters in the `operations` string.
- If the `operations` string is empty (`n == 0`), the function should handle this case appropriately, but the provided code does not explicitly check for this scenario.
- The function assumes that the `position_map` will always contain the initial position `(0, 0)`. While this is handled in the code, it is worth noting that this is a specific behavior that might need additional validation or handling in other contexts.
- The function does not validate the contents of the `operations` string, which should consist only of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. This validation is implicit in the code's operation but could be explicitly checked for robustness.**

The function's final state after conclusion is that it returns either 0, `min_length` if it is not infinity, or -1 based on the conditions described above.
