Postcondition: ***`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1, `current_y` can be -1 or 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and `n` is greater than 0. If the operation is 'U', `current_y` becomes 1. If the operation is 'D', `current_y` becomes -1. If the operation is 'L', `current_x` becomes -1. If the operation is 'R', `current_x` becomes 1.***
