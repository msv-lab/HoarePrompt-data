Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Objects Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `i`.
   - The loop runs based on the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n` must be true at the beginning of the loop.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 (the default starting point for the `range` function), the first iteration will check if `0 < n`, which simplifies to just checking if `n > 0`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `min_length` is initially set to `inf` (infinity).
   - `current_x` and `current_y` are both initialized to `0`.
   - `position_map` is initialized to `{(0, 0): -1}`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - We need to ensure that `n > 0` for the loop to execute.
   - There are no other variables or objects involved in controlling the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the state of the objects before the loop starts should be:

State: **`min_length` is inf, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` must be greater than 0**
