The code `final_y += 1` increments the value of `final_y` by 1. The initial state is that `operations` is a string of length greater than 0 and the first character of `operations` is 'U', and `op` is set to 'U'. Since the code does not affect `operations` or `op`, their states remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `final_y`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 0, the first character of `operations` is 'U', `op` is 'U', and `final_y` is increased by 1.**
