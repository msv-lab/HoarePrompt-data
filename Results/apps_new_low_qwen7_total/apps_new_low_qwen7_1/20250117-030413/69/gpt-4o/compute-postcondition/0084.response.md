The code updates the value of `target_pos` to be a tuple consisting of `current_x + dx` and `current_y + dy`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we will keep them in symbolic form.

Output State: **`min_length` is 0, `current_x` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or -1, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.**
