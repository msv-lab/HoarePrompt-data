The code `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i` updates the value of `position_map` at the key `(current_x, current_y)` to `i`. This does not affect the values of `min_length`, `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, `target_pos`, or `n`. The `min_length` remains unchanged if `target_pos` was already in `position_map`, otherwise, it remains unchanged regardless.

Output State: **`min_length` is either -1 or 0, `current_x` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}, `target_pos` is (current_x + dx, current_y + dy), and `n` is greater than 1.**
