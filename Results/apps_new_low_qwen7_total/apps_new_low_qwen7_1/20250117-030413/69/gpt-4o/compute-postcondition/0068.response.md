Postcondition: ***`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` can be -1 or 1; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.***

Explanation:
- The if part and the else part both maintain the same overall state of the program variables after the execution of the loop.
- The `min_length` is updated based on whether `target_pos` is in `position_map` and the value of `i`.
- The `current_x` and `current_y` values remain within their possible ranges.
- The `position_map` includes the new key-value pair `(current_x, current_y): i`.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 1, indicating that the loop can continue.
