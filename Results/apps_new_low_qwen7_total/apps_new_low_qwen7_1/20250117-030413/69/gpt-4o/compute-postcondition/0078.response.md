`current_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1. After decrementing by 1, the new value of `current_x` can be -2, 0, or 0 (if `current_x` was 1). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_length` is 0, `current_x` is either -2, 0, or 0, `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.**
