Output State: **`min_length` is 0 if a shorter path to any position was found; otherwise, it remains the initial value (which is inf); `current_x` and `current_y` can take any integer values within the bounds of the loop iterations; `position_map` contains all positions visited during the loop with their respective indices; `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; and `n` is the total number of iterations of the loop.**
