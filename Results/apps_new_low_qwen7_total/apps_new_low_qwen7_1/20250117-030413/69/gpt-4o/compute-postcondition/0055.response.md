Postcondition: ***`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` becomes -1. Otherwise, `current_x` changes according to the operation: it becomes -1 if 'L' is performed, and it becomes 1 if 'R' is performed; `current_x` remains 0 if 'R' is not performed.***
