Output State: `operations` is a string of length n, where n is the given integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, `final_x` is the net horizontal displacement, calculated as the number of 'R' moves minus the number of 'L' moves. `final_y` is the net vertical displacement, calculated as the number of 'U' moves minus the number of 'D' moves. Both `final_x` and `final_y` start from 0 and are updated based on the corresponding operations in the `operations` string. The loop executes exactly n times, once for each character in the `operations` string.
