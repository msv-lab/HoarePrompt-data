Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented in each iteration.
   - The variables `current_x` and `current_y` determine the key for the dictionary `position_map`.
   - The dictionary `position_map` itself is updated in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `current_x` and `current_y` remain within their possible ranges (-1, 0, 1 for `current_x` and -1, 1 for `current_y`).
   - `position_map` is updated to include the new key-value pair `(current_x, current_y): i`.
   - `n` is checked to ensure the loop continues.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `current_x` and `current_y` remain within their possible values.
- `position_map` should include the new key-value pair.
- `n` should still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` can be -1 or 1; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.**
