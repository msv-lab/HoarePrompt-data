The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. Based on the initial state, if the first character of `operations` is 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', it changes `final_y` or `final_x`. Since the code only modifies `final_x`, the value of `final_y` remains unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 1, if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1; `final_x` is increased by 1.**
