The code `current_y -= 1` decrements the value of `current_y` by 1. Since `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2, decrementing it will change its value depending on its current value.

- If `current_y` was -1, it becomes -2.
- If `current_y` was 0, it becomes -1.
- If `current_y` was -2, it remains -2.

The other variables (`min_length`, `current_x`, `position_map`, `target_pos`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`min_length` is 0, `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1, `current_y` is -2 if it was -1, -1 if it was 0, or -2 if it was -2, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.**
