Postcondition: **`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
