Postcondition: ***`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is either -1, 0, or 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` equals 'L', then `current_x` becomes -1. Otherwise, `current_x` is either 0 (if 'R' was not performed) or 1 (if 'R' was performed).***
