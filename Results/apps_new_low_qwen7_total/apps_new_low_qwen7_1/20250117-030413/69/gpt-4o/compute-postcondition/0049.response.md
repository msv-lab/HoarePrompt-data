`current_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `current_x` was 0, so now it is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is -1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and `operations[i]` is equal to 'L'.

Output State: **`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is -1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and `operations[i]` is equal to 'L'.**
