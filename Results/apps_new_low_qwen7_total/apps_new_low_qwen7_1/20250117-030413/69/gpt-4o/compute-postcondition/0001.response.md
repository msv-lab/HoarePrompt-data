Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `op`, which is derived from the string `operations`, and `operations` itself.

2. **Determine the Initial Condition for the Loop**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `operations` string. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute at least once is that `operations` must contain at least one character.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is given to be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `operations` is a string of length `n` containing exactly `n` characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `final_x` and `final_y` are both 0 at the start.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the string `operations` must have at least one character.

Given these points, we can summarize the required state for the loop to execute the first time:

- `operations` must have at least one character (i.e., its length is greater than 0).
- `op` will be the first character of the string `operations`.

Therefore, the state before the first execution of the loop should be:

**State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 0, `op` is the first character of the string `operations`**.
