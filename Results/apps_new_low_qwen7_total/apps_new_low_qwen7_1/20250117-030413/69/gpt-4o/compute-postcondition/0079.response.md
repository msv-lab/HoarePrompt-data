`current_x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1. After incrementing, `current_x` will be 0, 1, or 2 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_length` is 0, `current_x` is 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.**
