Postcondition: ***`min_length` remains 0, `current_x` is 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition of the if statement directly applies. The if condition ensures that `min_length` remains 0 and updates the states of `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, `target_pos`, and `n` as specified when the condition is met. Without an else part, these conditions hold true regardless of whether the if condition is satisfied or not.
