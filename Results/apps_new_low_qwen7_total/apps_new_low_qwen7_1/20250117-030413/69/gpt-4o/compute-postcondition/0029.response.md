`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `op` is the second character of `operations`, but the value of `final_x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`final_x` is decreased by 1, `op` is the second character of `operations`.**
