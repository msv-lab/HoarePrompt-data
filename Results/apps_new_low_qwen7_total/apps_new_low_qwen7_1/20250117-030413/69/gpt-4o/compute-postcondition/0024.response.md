Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length greater than 1. If the first character is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If the first character is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1. If the first character is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If the first character is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. In all cases, the state of `final_x` and `final_y` is adjusted according to the first character of `operations`, ensuring that their values are updated as per the specified conditions and remain unchanged if no specific action is taken.***
