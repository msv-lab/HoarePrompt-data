The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).

Based on the output cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns `min_length` if `min_length` is not infinity (float('inf')), otherwise it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`, and return either 0, `min_length` if it is not infinity, or -1 based on the given conditions.
