Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length greater than 0, `final_y` is `final_y - 1` if the first character of `operations` is 'D'. If the first character of `operations` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1.***

This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the first character of the string `operations` based on the given if-else block.
