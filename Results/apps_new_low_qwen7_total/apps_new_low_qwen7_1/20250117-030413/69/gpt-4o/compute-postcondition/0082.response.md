Postcondition: ***`min_length` is 0, `current_x` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -2, -1, or 0, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.***

Explanation: 
- If the condition `operations[i] == 'D'` is true, then `current_x` and `current_y` change according to specific rules, making `current_x` range from -2 to 2 and `current_y` range from -2 to 0.
- If the condition `operations[i] == 'D'` is false, then `current_x` and `current_y` take on different possible values as well, ensuring they still fall within the specified ranges.

The overall postcondition combines both scenarios, covering all possible states of `current_x` and `current_y` after the execution of the if-else block.
