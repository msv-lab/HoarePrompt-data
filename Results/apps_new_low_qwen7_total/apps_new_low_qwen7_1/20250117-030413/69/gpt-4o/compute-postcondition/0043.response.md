`current_y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` is 0, so the new value of `current_y` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, the current operation is 'U'.

Output State: **`min_length` is infinity, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, the current operation is 'U'**
