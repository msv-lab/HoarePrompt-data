Postcondition: ***`min_length` is either -1 or 0, `current_x` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, `current_y` can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}, `target_pos` is (current_x + dx, current_y + dy), and `n` is greater than 1. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change in the variables' values and states.***
