Output State: **min_length is inf, current_x is 0, current_y is 0, position_map is {(0, 0): -1}**

Explanation:
- The first line sets `min_length` to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- The second line initializes `current_x` to 0.
- The third line initializes `current_y` to 0.
- The fourth line creates a dictionary `position_map` with a key-value pair `(0, 0): -1`.

All these assignments and initializations do not depend on any external input or conditions. Therefore, they are executed as is, updating the initial state with new values where applicable. The `operations` string and `dx`, `dy` values are not defined or used in this code block, so their initial states remain unchanged.
