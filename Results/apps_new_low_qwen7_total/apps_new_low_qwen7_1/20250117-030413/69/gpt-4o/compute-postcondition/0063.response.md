The code snippet `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. Based on the initial state, `current_y` can be -1 or 1. After incrementing by 1, `current_y` will become 0 or 2, but since the range for `current_y` is limited to -1 and 1, the only valid value for `current_y` after the increment is 0. The other variables (`current_x`, `position_map`, `min_length`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` is 0; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; `min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; and `n` is greater than 1.**
