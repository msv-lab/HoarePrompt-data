`target_pos` is assigned the value of `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. The previous values of `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy` determine the new value of `target_pos`. However, since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `target_pos`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; and `n` is greater than 1.**
