Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(n)` function.
   - The other variables in the loop head are `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, `target_pos`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `min_length` is 0.
   - `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1.
   - `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2.
   - `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`.
   - `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

- `min_length` remains 0.
- `current_x` can still be -1, 0, or 1.
- `current_y` can still be -1, 0, or -2.
- `position_map` remains `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`.
- `target_pos` remains `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`min_length` is 0, `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1, `current_y` can be -1, 0, or -2, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `n` is greater than 1.**
