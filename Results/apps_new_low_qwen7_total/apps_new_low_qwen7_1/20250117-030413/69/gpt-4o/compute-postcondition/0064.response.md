In the given state, `current_y` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `current_y` could be -1 or 1, but now it will be either 0 or -2 depending on its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` is either 0 or -2; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.**
