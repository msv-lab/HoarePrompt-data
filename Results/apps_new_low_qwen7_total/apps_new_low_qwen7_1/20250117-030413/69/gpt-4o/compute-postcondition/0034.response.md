Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string with at least 2 characters, `op` is the second character of `operations`. If `op` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
