The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. Since `final_x` was not previously initialized or mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it starts as 0. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `final_x` but indicates it exists. After the code execution, `final_x` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 0, the first character of `operations` is 'R', and the first character of `operations` is not 'L'; `final_x` is 1**
