The code subtracts 1 from `final_y`. Since the initial state indicates that `final_y` is increased by 1 if the first character of `operations` is 'U', decreased by 1 if it is 'D', unchanged if it is 'L', and unchanged if it is 'R', the only thing we know for certain is that `final_y` is now 1 less than its initial value.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 1, `final_y` is 1 less than its initial value, if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_y` is unchanged. If the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_y` is unchanged. `final_x` is unchanged.**
