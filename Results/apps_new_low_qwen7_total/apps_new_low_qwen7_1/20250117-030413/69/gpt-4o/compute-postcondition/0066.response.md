In the given initial state:
- `min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`;
- `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1;
- `current_y` can be -1 or 1;
- `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`;
- `n` is greater than 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
current_x += 1
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- The value of `current_x` is incremented by 1.
- The possible values for `current_x` were -1, 0, or 1. After incrementing by 1, the new value of `current_x` will be 0 (if `current_x` was -1), 1 (if `current_x` was 0), or 2 (if `current_x` was 1). However, since `current_x` can only take values -1, 0, or 1, if `current_x` was 1, it wraps around to -1.
- The values of `current_y`, `position_map`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `current_x` can now be 0, 1, or -1 (since 2 wraps around to -1).
- `current_y` can be -1 or 1.
- `position_map` remains `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`.
- `n` is still greater than 1.

Output State: **`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be 0, 1, or -1; `current_y` can be -1 or 1; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.**
