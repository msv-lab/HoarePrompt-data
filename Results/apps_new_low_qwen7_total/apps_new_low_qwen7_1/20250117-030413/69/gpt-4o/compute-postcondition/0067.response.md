Postcondition: ***`min_length` is `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1; `current_y` can be -1 or 1; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (current_x, current_y): i}`; and `n` is greater than 1.***

Explanation:
- The if part does not change the state beyond the given conditions, as it matches the precondition directly.
- Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains unchanged from the if part's conditions.

Thus, the postcondition summarizes the state where `min_length` is updated based on the presence of `target_pos` in `position_map`, and the coordinates and the map remain as specified.
