The code `final_x -= 1` decreases the value of `final_x` by 1. Based on the initial state, if the first character of `operations` is 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', it does not affect the value of `final_x` directly through this line of code. The other variables (`final_y` and `operations`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length greater than 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1; `final_x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length greater than 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'U', `final_y` is increased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1; if the first character of `operations` is 'R', `final_x` is increased by 1; `final_x` is decreased by 1.**
