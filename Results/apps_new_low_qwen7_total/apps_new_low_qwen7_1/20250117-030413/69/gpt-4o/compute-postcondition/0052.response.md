`current_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` is 0, so now `current_x` is 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`min_length` is inf, `current_x` is 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `operations[i]` is 'R'**
