The value of `current_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` was 0, so the new value of `current_y` is -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_length` is inf, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and the current operation is 'D'.

Output State: **`min_length` is inf, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and the current operation is 'D'**
