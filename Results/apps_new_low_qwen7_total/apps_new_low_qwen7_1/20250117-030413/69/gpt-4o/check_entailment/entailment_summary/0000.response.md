Reasoning:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to make the robot end at the desired coordinates `(x, y)`.

1. The code first calculates the net horizontal and vertical displacements (`final_x` and `final_y`) based on the given sequence of operations.
2. If the starting point and the end point are the same (`dx == 0` and `dy == 0`), it immediately returns `0`.
3. Otherwise, it traverses the operations string again, tracking the current position and storing visited positions in a dictionary (`position_map`).
4. During this traversal, it checks if the target position (current position adjusted by `dx` and `dy`) has been visited before. If so, it updates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.
5. Finally, it returns the minimum length of the subsegment, or `-1` if no valid path is found.

The logic and implementation in the `func_1` function align with the problem statement and the provided execution summary. There are no obvious errors or missing validations that would cause the function to behave incorrectly according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
