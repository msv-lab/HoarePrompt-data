Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.

# Program:
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `operations` (a string consisting of exactly n characters, each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). It calculates the net horizontal (`final_x`) and vertical (`final_y`) displacements based on the operations string. 

After calculating these displacements, it determines the relative positions `dx` and `dy` between the starting point (`x`, `y`) and the ending point of the operations sequence. If the starting point and ending point are the same (i.e., `dx == 0` and `dy == 0`), the function immediately returns 0.

Otherwise, it performs another traversal of the `operations` string while tracking visited positions using a dictionary (`position_map`). During this traversal, it checks if the target position (calculated as `current_x + dx` and `current_y + dy`) has been visited before. If a previously visited position leads to a shorter path to the target, it updates `min_length` accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum length of the path found (`min_length`), or -1 if no valid path is found.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is at its maximum value (2⋅10^5), the function will traverse up to 2⋅10^5 characters in the `operations` string.
- If the `operations` string is empty (`n == 0`), the function should handle this case appropriately, but the provided code does not explicitly check for this scenario.
- The function assumes that the `position_map` will always contain the initial position `(0, 0)`. While this is handled in the code, it is worth noting that this is a specific behavior that might need additional validation or handling in other contexts.
- The function does not validate the contents of the `operations` string, which should consist only of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. This validation is implicit in the code's operation but could be explicitly checked for robustness.
