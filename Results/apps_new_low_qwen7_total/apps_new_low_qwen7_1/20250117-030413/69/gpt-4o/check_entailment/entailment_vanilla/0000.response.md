Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly and initializes variables.
2. It calculates the final position `(final_x, final_y)` of the robot after executing all operations.
3. It then checks if the final position matches the target position `(x, y)`. If it does, the output is `0`, indicating no changes are needed.
4. If the positions do not match, it iterates through the operations again while keeping track of the current position and using a dictionary (`position_map`) to store the last seen positions.
5. For each operation, it calculates the target position `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` that would result in the robot being at `(x, y)` if the current operations were changed to reach `(x, y)`.
6. If this target position has been seen before, it calculates the length of the subsegment between the current index and the previously seen index of the same position. It updates `min_length` if this subsegment is shorter.
7. After iterating through all operations, it returns the minimum length found or `-1` if no valid subsegment was found.

Given the logic described, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
