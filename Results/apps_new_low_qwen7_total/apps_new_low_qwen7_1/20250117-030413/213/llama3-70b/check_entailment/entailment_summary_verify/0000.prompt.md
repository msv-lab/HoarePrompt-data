You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string. It checks if the integer `n` can be reduced by removing exactly one digit such that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. If such a reduction is possible, the function prints 'YES' followed by the resulting integer and exits. If no such reduction is possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by printing either 'YES' with a number or 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to check all possible numbers formed by removing one digit from the input number and checks if any of them are divisible by 8. However, the program does not handle the case where removing more than one digit might lead to a valid number that is divisible by 8. For instance, consider the input `1234`. The program will only check for numbers formed by removing one digit at a time, which means it will not consider combinations like `234` (formed by removing the first digit) or `134` (formed by removing the second digit). To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to explore all possible combinations of removing digits, not just one at a time.
