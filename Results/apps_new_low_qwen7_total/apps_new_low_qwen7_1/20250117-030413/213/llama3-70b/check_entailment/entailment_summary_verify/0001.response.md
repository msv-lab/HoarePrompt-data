### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where removing digits could result in the number being `0`, which is divisible by 8. When `n` is `0`, the program will not remove any digits and will print `YES` followed by `0`.

2. **Leading Zeros**:
   - The program correctly checks for leading zeros in the resultant number. If the resultant number starts with '0', it is considered invalid, and the loop continues to check other possibilities.

3. **Comprehensive Search**:
   - The program iterates through each possible subsequence of digits by removing one digit at a time. This ensures that all potential numbers formed by removing one digit are checked.

4. **Multiple Solutions**:
   - The program only prints the first valid number it finds. While the problem statement allows for multiple valid solutions, the program does not guarantee that it will find the smallest or lexicographically smallest valid number. However, it still meets the requirement of printing one valid number if available.

5. **Termination**:
   - The program exits immediately after finding a valid number, ensuring efficiency. If no valid number is found, it prints "NO".

6. **Handling Single Digit Numbers**:
   - The program correctly handles single-digit numbers. For example, if `n` is `8`, the program will print `YES` followed by `8`.

7. **Handling Large Numbers**:
   - The program efficiently checks all possible sub-numbers formed by removing one digit. Given the constraints (at most 100 digits), this approach is feasible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It checks all necessary conditions and prints the first valid number it finds, which satisfies the problem requirements.

**Final: True**
