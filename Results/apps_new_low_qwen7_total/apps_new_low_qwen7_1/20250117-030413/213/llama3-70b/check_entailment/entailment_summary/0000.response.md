Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to check if a non-negative integer \( n \) can be reduced by removing exactly one digit such that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. The program iterates through each digit of \( n \), removes one digit at a time, and checks if the resulting number meets the criteria. If a valid number is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the number and exits. If no valid number is found after checking all possible single-digit removals, it prints 'NO'.

However, the program only considers removing one digit at a time, which might not cover all cases where removing more than one digit could result in a number divisible by 8. According to the problem statement, we need to determine if it's possible to remove some digits (possibly none) so that the result is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.

Given this, the current implementation is insufficient because it only checks for the removal of a single digit, missing other potential solutions where multiple digits might need to be removed.

Correctness: **False**
