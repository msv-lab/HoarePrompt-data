You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes.
def func():
    n = int(input())

digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers with one element removed such that the resulting number is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', `i` is the index of the removed element, `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits` if it meets the condition, otherwise `new_n` remains undefined. The loop prints 'YES' followed by the value of `new_n` and exits if the condition is met; otherwise, the loop continues until all possible elements are removed or no valid `new_n` is found.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string. It checks if the integer `n` can be reduced by removing exactly one digit such that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. If such a reduction is possible, the function prints 'YES' followed by the resulting integer and exits. If no such reduction is possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by printing either 'YES' with a number or 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle cases where removing digits could result in the number being `0`, which is divisible by 8.
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program checks for leading zeros after removing digits, ensuring the resultant number does not start with zero.
3. **Comprehensive Search**: The program iterates through each possible subsequence of digits by removing one digit at a time. This ensures that all potential numbers formed by removing one digit are checked.
4. **Multiple Solutions**: If there are multiple solutions, the program will print one of them, which meets the requirement.
5. **Termination**: The program exits immediately after finding a valid number, ensuring efficiency.

Given these points, let's verify the logic:

- The program correctly converts the input into a list of digits.
- It iterates over each position to remove one digit at a time.
- It constructs the new number by excluding the current digit.
- It checks if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
- If a valid number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits.
- If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Since the program handles all the necessary conditions and logic as specified in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
