### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided program does not handle cases where more than one digit needs to be removed to form a valid number divisible by 8. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the program does indeed attempt to find a valid number by removing one digit at a time. It iterates through each digit and removes it to form a new number, checking if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.

The annotated code clearly shows that the program checks each possible number formed by removing one digit from the original number. If a valid number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits. If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Given this, the program does not need to explore all possible combinations of removing digits, as it only needs to find one valid number. The program correctly handles the task of finding a valid number by removing one digit at a time, which is sufficient for the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does indeed explore all possible numbers formed by removing one digit at a time, which is sufficient to find a valid number if one exists.

### Final:
**True**
