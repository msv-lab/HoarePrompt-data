### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and converts it into a list of digits.
   
2. **Iteration Over Digits**:
   - The program iterates over each digit in the number and generates a new number by removing the current digit.
   - For each new number formed, it checks if the number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
   
3. **Condition Check**:
   - If the new number satisfies the conditions (divisible by 8 and no leading zeros), the program prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits.
   - If no such number is found after checking all possible combinations, the program prints "NO".

### Key Points to Verify:
- **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The program ensures that the new number does not have leading zeros by checking `str(new_n)[0] != '0'`.
- **Divisibility by 8**: The program correctly checks if the new number is divisible by 8 using `new_n % 8 == 0`.
- **Exhaustive Search**: The program exhaustively searches through all possible numbers formed by removing one digit at a time.

### Conclusion:
The given annotated program follows the logic correctly and meets the problem requirements. It checks all possible ways to remove one digit at a time to form a valid number divisible by 8 without leading zeros. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
