Reasoning:

1. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle cases where removing digits could result in the number being `0`, which is divisible by 8.
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program checks for leading zeros after removing digits, ensuring the resultant number does not start with zero.
3. **Comprehensive Search**: The program iterates through each possible subsequence of digits by removing one digit at a time. This ensures that all potential numbers formed by removing one digit are checked.
4. **Multiple Solutions**: If there are multiple solutions, the program will print one of them, which meets the requirement.
5. **Termination**: The program exits immediately after finding a valid number, ensuring efficiency.

Given these points, let's verify the logic:

- The program correctly converts the input into a list of digits.
- It iterates over each position to remove one digit at a time.
- It constructs the new number by excluding the current digit.
- It checks if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
- If a valid number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits.
- If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Since the program handles all the necessary conditions and logic as specified in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
