Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')
