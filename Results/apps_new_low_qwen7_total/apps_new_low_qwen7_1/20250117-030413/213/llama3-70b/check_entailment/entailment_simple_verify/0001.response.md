### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and the logic it follows. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where removing digits could result in the number being `0`, which is divisible by 8. However, the original assessment did not explicitly mention this specific edge case. Nevertheless, the program inherently covers this scenario because when a digit is removed, the resulting number is checked for divisibility by 8.

2. **Leading Zeros**:
   - The program correctly checks for leading zeros after removing digits using the condition `str(new_n)[0] != '0'`. This ensures that the resultant number does not start with a zero.

3. **Comprehensive Search**:
   - The program iterates through each position to remove one digit at a time. This ensures that all potential numbers formed by removing one digit are checked. The use of a `for` loop over the range `len(digits)` effectively achieves this.

4. **Multiple Solutions**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by one of the valid numbers if it finds a valid number. This meets the requirement to print any valid number if multiple solutions exist.

5. **Termination**:
   - The program exits immediately after finding a valid number using `exit()`, ensuring efficiency. If no valid number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions and logic as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the original assessment.
