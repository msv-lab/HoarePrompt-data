Reasoning:
The annotated program logic and the behavior described align with the problem statement. Let's break down the process:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input and converts it into a list of its digits for easier manipulation.

2. **Loop through Digits**: The program iterates through each digit, considering the number formed by removing each digit individually. This is done using slicing and joining operations.

3. **Check Conditions**: For each new number formed by removing a digit, it checks two conditions:
   - Whether the new number is divisible by 8.
   - Whether the new number does not have leading zeros.

4. **Output**: If any of these new numbers meet the criteria, the program prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits.

5. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding a suitable number, the program prints "NO".

This logic correctly addresses the problem requirements:
- It checks all possible single-digit removals.
- It ensures the resulting number is divisible by 8.
- It avoids leading zeros in the resulting number.
- It handles all edge cases, including when no valid number can be formed.

Given this detailed analysis, the annotated program is consistent with the problem description and performs the required operations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
