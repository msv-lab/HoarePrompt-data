The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string. It checks if the integer `n` can be reduced by removing exactly one digit such that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. If such a reduction is possible, the function prints 'YES' followed by the resulting integer and exits. If no such reduction is possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by printing either 'YES' with a number or 'NO'.
