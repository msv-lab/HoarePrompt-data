Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 1, `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits[:1] + digits[2:]`. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the function prints 'YES' and the value of `new_n`. Otherwise, the function does not print anything and retains the original values of `n`, `digits`, `i`, and `new_n`.***
