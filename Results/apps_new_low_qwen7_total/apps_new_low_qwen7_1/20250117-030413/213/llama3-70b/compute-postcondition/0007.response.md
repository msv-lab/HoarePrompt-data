The code removes the first digit from the number represented by `digits` and stores the result in `new_n`. Given that `i` is 1, this means the first digit is removed from `digits`. 

Let's assume the initial state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer
- `digits` is a non-empty list of integers
- `i` is 1
- `new_n` is an integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits`

The code:
```python
new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
```
removes the first element (since `i` is 1) from the `digits` list and converts the remaining elements back into an integer.

After executing the code, `new_n` is updated based on the new list formed by removing the first element from `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 1, `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits[:1] + digits[2:]`**
