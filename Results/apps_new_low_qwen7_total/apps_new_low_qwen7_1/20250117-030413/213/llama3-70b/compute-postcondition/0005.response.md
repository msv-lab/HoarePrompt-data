Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 0, `new_n` is an integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits`. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the previous value of `new_n` is printed as 'YES' and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any specific changes to the variables' states.***
