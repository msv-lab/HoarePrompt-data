Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers with its second element removed, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits`. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the program prints 'YES' and executes the print statement with the value of `new_n`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken (the program simply continues executing).***
