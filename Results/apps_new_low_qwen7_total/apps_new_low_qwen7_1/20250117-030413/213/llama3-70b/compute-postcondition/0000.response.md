Initial State: n is a non-negative integer represented as a string, with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes.

Code Snippet:
```
n = int(input())
digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and converts it into an integer. Since `n` was initially a string, this line converts `n` into an integer.
2. The second line `digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]` converts the integer `n` back into a list of its individual digits, where each digit is also an integer.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a string, after running the provided code snippet, `n` will be converted to an integer and stored in the variable `n`. The variable `digits` will hold a list of integers, each representing a digit from the original string representation of `n`.

Output State: **n is an integer, digits is a list of integers where each element is a digit from the original string representation of n**
