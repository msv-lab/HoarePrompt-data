The code replaces the `i`-th digit in the number `n` with a gap (removes it), effectively reducing the length of the number by one digit. Let's break down the steps:

1. `map(str, digits)` converts each digit in the list `digits` to a string.
2. `digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:]` creates a new list that excludes the `i`-th element from `digits`.
3. `''.join(...)` joins these elements back into a single string.
4. `int(...)`: converts this string back into an integer.

Since `i` is 0, the first digit is removed from the number represented by `digits`. The new number (`new_n`) is thus formed by removing the first digit from the original number.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 0, `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits`.**
