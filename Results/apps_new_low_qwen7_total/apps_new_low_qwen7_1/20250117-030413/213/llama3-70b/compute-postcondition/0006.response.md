Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head mentions `i` and `len(digits)`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(digits) - 1`.
3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `1`.
   - `len(digits)` remains unchanged because it is the length of the list, which does not change during the loop execution.

Given these points, the state needs to be updated for `i` to reflect the next iteration.

**State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 1, `new_n` is an integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits`. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the previous value of `new_n` is printed as 'YES' and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any specific changes to the variables' states.**
