The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 100 digits and no leading zeroes. The function returns a specific value based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: `n` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. If `n` is equal to "0", the function returns 0.
- Case_2: `n` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. If `n` is not equal to "0", the function returns 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string and return 0 if `n` is "0", otherwise return 1.
