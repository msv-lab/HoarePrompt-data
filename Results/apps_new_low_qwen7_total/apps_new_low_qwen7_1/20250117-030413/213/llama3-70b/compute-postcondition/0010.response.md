Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` which ranges from `0` to `len(digits) - 1`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `digits` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits[:1] + digits[2:]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues if `i` is less than `len(digits)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `new_n` remains unchanged as it is computed based on the initial state of `digits` and does not depend on the loop counter `i`.

5. **Ensure the `digits` list and `n` remain unchanged**:
   - The list `digits` and the integer `n` do not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2 (since it needs to be incremented from 1).
- `new_n` remains the same as it was computed in the previous iteration.
- `n` and `digits` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits[:1] + digits[2:]`.**
