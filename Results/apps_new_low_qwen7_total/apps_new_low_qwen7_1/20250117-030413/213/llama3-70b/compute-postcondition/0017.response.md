Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string. It checks if the integer `n` can be reduced by removing exactly one digit such that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. If such a reduction is possible, the function prints 'YES' followed by the resulting integer and exits. If no such reduction is possible, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by printing either 'YES' with a number or 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is "0", the function will print 'YES' followed by "0" because removing any digit from "0" still results in "0", which is divisible by 8.
- If `n` consists of only digits that do not form a number divisible by 8 when any single digit is removed, the function will print 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotated code does not explicitly handle the case where the input string `n` might contain invalid characters (non-digits). However, since `n` is defined to be a non-negative integer represented as a string, this should be covered by the initial `int(input())` conversion, which would raise an error for invalid inputs. Therefore, the function implicitly handles this by ensuring the input is a valid non-negative integer string.
