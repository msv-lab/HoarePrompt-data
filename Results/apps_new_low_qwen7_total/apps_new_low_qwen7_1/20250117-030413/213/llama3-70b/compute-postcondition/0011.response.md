The code `new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))` impacts the following:
- `new_n` is assigned a new value. Specifically, `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:]`. Since `i` is 2, this means taking the elements of `digits` from the start up to (but not including) the second element, and from the element right after the second one to the end. This effectively removes the second element from `digits`.

Given the initial state where `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer, the updated state will be:
- `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits` after removing the second element.

Let's denote the elements of `digits` as `[d1, d2, ..., dn]`. After executing the code, the new value of `new_n` would be `d1 * 10^(n-2) + d3 + ... + dn` if there are more than two elements in `digits`, or simply `d1` if `digits` only contains two elements (since the second element would be removed).

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits` after removing the second element.**
