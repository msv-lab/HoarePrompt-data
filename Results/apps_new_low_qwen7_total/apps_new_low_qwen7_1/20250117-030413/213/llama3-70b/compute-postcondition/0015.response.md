The code snippet simply prints 'NO' without changing any variable values. The initial conditions remain unchanged after executing this line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers with one element removed such that the resulting number is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', `i` is the index of the removed element, `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits` if it meets the condition, otherwise `new_n` remains undefined, and the program prints 'NO'.**
