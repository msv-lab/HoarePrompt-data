The initial state is: `n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 1, `new_n` is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by `digits[:1] + digits[2:]`.

The code block consists of two print statements followed by an exit function. Let's analyze the impact of each line:

1. `print('YES')`: This prints "YES" to the console.
2. `print(new_n)`: This prints the value of `new_n` to the console.
3. `exit()`: This terminates the program execution.

Since the `exit()` function is called, the program stops executing after the second print statement. Therefore, the value of `new_n` is printed, but `n` and `digits` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the final output state will include the value of `new_n` printed, but `n` and `digits` will retain their initial values.

Output State: **n is an integer, digits is a non-empty list of integers, i is 1, new_n is the integer obtained by removing the first digit from the number represented by digits[:1] + digits[2:], printed 'YES', and printed new_n**
