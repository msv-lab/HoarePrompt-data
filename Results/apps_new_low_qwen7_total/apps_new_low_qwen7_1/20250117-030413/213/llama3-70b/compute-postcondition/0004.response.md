Output State: **n is an integer, digits is a non-empty list of integers, i is 0, new_n is an integer divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the previous value of new_n is printed as 'YES' and then the program exits**
Explanation: The code block prints 'YES' and then prints the value of `new_n`. After printing, the program exits using the `exit()` function. Since the program exits, no further changes are made to the variables. The value of `new_n` is used in the print statement, but its exact value before printing is not specified in the code. The precondition states that `new_n` is an integer divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'.
