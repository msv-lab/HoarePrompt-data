Output State: **`n` is an integer, `digits` is a non-empty list of integers with one element removed such that the resulting number is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', `i` is the index of the removed element, `new_n` is the integer formed by the remaining elements of `digits` if it meets the condition, otherwise `new_n` remains undefined. The loop prints 'YES' followed by the value of `new_n` and exits if the condition is met; otherwise, the loop continues until all possible elements are removed or no valid `new_n` is found.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over the indices of the `digits` list, removing each digit one by one and checking if the resulting number (`new_n`) is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'.
2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i`: The index of the digit being removed, changes with each iteration.
   - `digits`: A list of integers representing the digits of `n`, changes by removing one digit per iteration.
   - `new_n`: An integer formed by removing the `i-th` digit from `digits`, only defined if the condition `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'` is met.
   - Invariants: None of the other variables are invariant since they are either part of the input or dynamically generated within the loop.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will continue to remove digits from `digits` and check if the resulting number is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0'. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES' and the value of `new_n` before exiting. If the condition is not met, the loop continues until all digits are removed or no valid `new_n` is found.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The output state describes the final values of `n`, `digits`, `i`, and `new_n` based on whether the condition was met during the loop execution. If no valid `new_n` is found, `new_n` will be undefined. The loop ensures that `digits` is modified appropriately and `i` reflects the index of the removed digit.
