The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print(k)`
2. `break`

Given the initial state where `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, and the condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` holds true, we need to determine the impact of these lines.

### Analysis of the Code Lines:

1. **`print(k)`**: This line will print the value of `k`, but since `k` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, this line will raise a NameError. However, for the purpose of understanding the output state, we assume the code execution stops due to the `NameError`.

2. **`break`**: This line is typically used within loops to exit the loop prematurely. Since there is no loop in the given code, this statement would raise a SyntaxError if executed. But since the code execution is halted due to the `NameError` before reaching the `break` statement, we do not need to consider it further.

### Conclusion:

Since the code execution is halted due to the `NameError` caused by trying to print an undefined variable `k`, no further changes are made to the initial state of the variables.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0**
