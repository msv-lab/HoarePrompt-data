Output State: **vasya_eaten is 2 + k, petya_eaten is candies // 10, candies is 0**

Explanation:
1. Initially, `vasya_eaten` is `2 + initial_candies`, `petya_eaten` is 0, and `candies` must be greater than 0.
2. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` updates `vasya_eaten` to be `2 + initial_candies + min(k, candies)`. This means if `k` is less than or equal to `candies`, then `vasya_eaten` will be updated by `k`; otherwise, it will be updated by `candies`.
3. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` subtracts `min(k, candies)` from `candies`. If `k` is less than or equal to `candies`, then `candies` will be reduced by `k`; otherwise, it will be reduced by `candies`.
4. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` updates `petya_eaten` to be `candies // 10`. Since `candies` is now 0 (after the subtraction in the previous line), `petya_eaten` becomes 0.
5. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`. Since `petya_eaten` is now 0, this line does not change the value of `candies`.

Thus, the final state is `vasya_eaten` is `2 + initial_candies + min(k, candies)` (which simplifies to `2 + k` if `k <= candies` and `2 + candies` if `candies <= k`), `petya_eaten` is 0, and `candies` is 0.
