Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and n is now n - min(k, candies), k is 1, candies is candies - min(k, candies) - petya_eaten, vasya_eaten is min(k, candies), petya_eaten is candies // 10**

Explanation:
1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`:
   - `min(k, candies)` is equal to `k` because `k` is 1 and `candies` is `n`.
   - Therefore, `vasya_eaten` is incremented by 1.
   - After this line, `vasya_eaten` is 1 and `candies` is reduced by 1 (since `min(k, candies)` is 1).

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`:
   - As mentioned above, `min(k, candies)` is 1.
   - So, `candies` is now `n - 1`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`:
   - `petya_eaten` is now the integer division of `candies` by 10.
   - If `candies` is not a multiple of 10, the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`:
   - `candies` is further reduced by `petya_eaten`.

Combining these effects, the final state is as described above.
