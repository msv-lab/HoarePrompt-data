Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop continues as long as `candies` is greater than 0. Inside the loop:
1. `vasya_eaten` is increased by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
2. `candies` is decreased by the same amount as `vasya_eaten`.
3. `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10`, and `candies` is further decreased by `petya_eaten`.

### Track Variable Changes
- `k` remains constant at 1.
- `vasya_eaten` accumulates the amount of candies eaten by Vasya.
- `candies` decreases by the sum of the amounts eaten by both Vasya and Petya.
- `petya_eaten` is determined by `candies // 10` and depends on the current value of `candies`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
Each iteration of the loop reduces `candies` by the sum of `min(k, candies)` and `candies // 10`. The loop will continue until `candies` is reduced to 0.

### Verify Relationships
From the given output states:
- After 1 iteration: `n` is adjusted, `k` remains 1, `candies` is updated, `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, candies)`, and `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10`.
- After 2 iterations: `vasya_eaten` is `2`, `candies` is `candies - 1`, `petya_eaten` is `(candies - 1) // 10`, and `n` is `n - 1`.
- After 3 iterations: `vasya_eaten` is `2 + c_initial - 1`, `candies` is `0`, `petya_eaten` is `0`.

### Determine the Final Output State
When `candies` becomes 0, the loop stops. At this point:
- `candies` is 0.
- `vasya_eaten` will be the total amount of candies eaten by Vasya, which is the sum of `min(1, candies)` over all iterations.
- `petya_eaten` will be 0 because `candies` is 0.

To find `vasya_eaten`, we need to consider the pattern:
- In each iteration, `vasya_eaten` increases by 1 if `candies` is at least 1.
- The loop continues until `candies` is depleted.

If the loop executes `i` times, `vasya_eaten` will be `i`. Since `candies` starts as `n` and is reduced by `1 + candies // 10` each time, the loop will terminate when `candies` reaches 0.

Thus, after the loop completes, `candies` will be 0, `petya_eaten` will be 0, and `vasya_eaten` will be equal to the number of iterations, which is `n` if `n` is a multiple of 11 (since `1 + candies // 10` sums up to `n` over the iterations).

### Final Output State
Output State: **n is 0, k is 1, candies is 0, vasya_eaten is n, petya_eaten is 0.**
