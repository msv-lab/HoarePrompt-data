Given the initial state:
- `vasya_eaten` is 2
- `candies` is `c_initial - 1` and `c_initial` must be greater than 1
- `petya_eaten` is `(c_initial - 2) // 10`
- `n` is `n - 1`

The code block to execute is:
```
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Let's go through each line:

1. **Line 1**: `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - Since `k` is not defined, we assume it refers to `candies` (as `candies` is the only other quantity that can reasonably be used in this context). Therefore, `min(k, candies)` simplifies to `min(candies, candies)`, which is `candies`.
   - This means `vasya_eaten` is updated to `vasya_eaten + candies`.
   - Let's denote `candies` as `c` for simplicity.
   - After this line, `vasya_eaten` becomes `2 + c`.

2. **Line 2**: `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - Similar to the first line, `min(k, candies)` is `c`, so this line updates `candies` to `c - c`, resulting in `candies` becoming `0`.

3. **Line 3**: `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - With `candies` being `0`, `petya_eaten` becomes `0 // 10`, which is `0`.

4. **Line 4**: `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - Since `petya_eaten` is `0`, `candies` remains `0`.

After executing all the lines of code, the updated states are:
- `vasya_eaten` is `2 + c` (where `c` is `c_initial - 1`).
- `candies` is `0`.
- `petya_eaten` is `0`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **vasya_eaten is 2 + c_initial - 1, candies is 0, petya_eaten is 0**
