Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 0, k is 2, petya_eaten is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `candies = n` assigns the value of `n` (which is 0) to `candies`. Therefore, `candies` becomes 0.
- The second line `vasya_eaten = 0` assigns the value 0 to `vasya_eaten`. This does not affect any previously mentioned variables other than `vasya_eaten`.
- The values of `k` and `petya_eaten` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified within the provided code block.
