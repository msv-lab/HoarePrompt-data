The loop in this example is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute as long as it is entered. There are no conditions to check within the loop head itself to determine whether the loop should continue. Therefore, no adjustments to the loop head's variables (`candies`, `vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, or `k`) are necessary to ensure the loop executes one more time.

State: **`candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, `k` is increased by 1**
