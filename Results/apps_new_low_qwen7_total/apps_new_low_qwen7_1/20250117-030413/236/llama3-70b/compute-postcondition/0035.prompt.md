Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: candies is n, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0, k is increased by 1
Code of the loop:
while candies > 0:
    vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
    candies -= min(k, candies)
    petya_eaten = candies // 10
    candies -= petya_eaten


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: candies is n - k, vasya_eaten is min(k, n), petya_eaten is (n - min(k, n)) // 10
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Initial State: `candies` must be greater than 0

Code Snippet:
```
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Analysis:
1. The first line updates `vasya_eaten` by adding the minimum value between `k` and `candies` to it.
2. The second line decreases `candies` by the minimum value between `k` and `candies`.
3. The third line sets `petya_eaten` to be `candies` divided by 10 (integer division).
4. The fourth line decreases `candies` by the value of `petya_eaten`.

Let's assume an initial value for `candies` (since it must be greater than 0, let's use 20 for demonstration purposes; the exact value doesn't change the process):

After the first line:
- `vasya_eaten` is updated by adding the minimum of `k` and `candies`. Let's assume `k` is 15 for this example.
- `vasya_eaten += min(15, 20) = vasya_eaten + 15`. If `vasya_eaten` was initially 0, then `vasya_eaten` becomes 15.

After the second line:
- `candies -= min(15, 20) = candies - 15`. So, `candies` becomes 20 - 15 = 5.

After the third line:
- `petya_eaten = candies // 10 = 5 // 10 = 0`. So, `petya_eaten` is set to 0.

After the fourth line:
- `candies -= petya_eaten = candies - 0 = candies - 0 = 5`. `candies` remains 5.

Final State: **candies is 5, vasya_eaten is 15, petya_eaten is 0**

Note: The actual values of `k` and `candy` should be used in place of assumptions, but the process described above will hold true for any valid `k` and `candies` values where `candies > 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: candies is 4, vasya_eaten is 16, petya_eaten is 0


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
