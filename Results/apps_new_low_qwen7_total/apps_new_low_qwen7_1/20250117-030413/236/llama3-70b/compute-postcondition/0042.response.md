Functionality: **The function determines the minimum number of rounds \( k \) required such that Vasya eats at least half of the total candies \( n \) (i.e., \( 2 \times \text{vasya\_eaten} \geq n \)). In each round, Vasya eats up to \( k \) candies, and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies. The function prints the smallest \( k \) that satisfies the condition and then terminates. The function assumes \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \).**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If \( n = 1 \), the function will determine that \( k = 1 \) is sufficient since Vasya can eat the single candy in one round.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where \( n \) might be negative or outside the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). However, given the problem constraints, it is safe to assume that valid input will always fall within this range.

**Final State of the Program:**
- After the function concludes, the program will have printed the smallest integer \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the total candies \( n \). The variables `n`, `k`, `candies`, `vasya_eaten`, and `petya_eaten` will be set to the values described in the annotation: `n` is 32, `k` is 5, `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 16, and `petya_eaten` is 0.
