Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`.
- The second line initializes the variable `k` to 1.
Since no further operations are performed on either `n` or `k`, their initial values remain unchanged after executing the provided code block.
