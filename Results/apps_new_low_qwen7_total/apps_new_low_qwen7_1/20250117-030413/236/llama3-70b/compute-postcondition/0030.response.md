Output State: **candies is n - k, vasya_eaten is min(k, n), petya_eaten is (n - min(k, n)) // 10**

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` adds the minimum value between `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` subtracts the same minimum value from `candies`.
3. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to the integer division of `candies` by 10.
4. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 and represents the initial value of `candies`, the final value of `candies` is `n - k`, assuming `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, and the value of `petya_eaten` is `(n - min(k, n)) // 10`.
