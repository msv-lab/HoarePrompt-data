Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0. Since `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, this condition is always true given the precondition, so the postcondition remains as the initial state with `vasya_eaten * 2` being equal to `n`.***
