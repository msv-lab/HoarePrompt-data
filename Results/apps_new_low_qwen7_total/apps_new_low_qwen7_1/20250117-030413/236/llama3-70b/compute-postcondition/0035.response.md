Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 16, petya_eaten is 0.**

### Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.
   - In each iteration, `vasya_eaten` is incremented by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
   - `candies` is then reduced by this same minimum value.
   - `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10`, and `candies` is further reduced by `petya_eaten`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**:
     - `petya_eaten` is always `candies // 10` in each iteration.
     - After `petya_eaten` is calculated, `candies` is reduced by `petya_eaten`, which means `candies` will eventually become 0 if the loop continues.

   - **Variables updated in the loop**:
     - `vasya_eaten` is incremented by `min(k, candies)` in each iteration.
     - `candies` is updated based on the above operations.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - Each iteration reduces `candies` by `min(k, candies) + petya_eaten`.
   - Since `petya_eaten = candies // 10`, the reduction in `candies` per iteration is `min(k, candies) + candies // 10`.
   - The loop continues until `candies` is no longer greater than 0.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Given the initial state `candies = n`, `vasya_eaten = 0`, `petya_eaten = 0`, and `k` is increased by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `vasya_eaten = min(k, n)`, `candies = n - min(k, n)`, and `petya_eaten = (n - min(k, n)) // 10`.
   - After the second iteration, `candies` is further reduced by `min(k, n - min(k, n)) + (n - min(k, n)) // 10`.
   - This process continues until `candies` is reduced to 0.

Given the provided output state after the loop executes 2 times, we can infer that `candies` must be reduced to 4 after 2 iterations, leading to the final state where `candies` is 0 after the third iteration.

Thus, the final state after all iterations is:
- **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 16, petya_eaten is 0.**
