Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The condition for the loop is `candies > 0`.
2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `candies` is `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is `0`.
   - `petya_eaten` is `0`.
   - `k` is increased by `1`.

3. **Determine the Requirement for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `candies > 0` must be true.
   - Given that `candies` is currently `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `0` for the loop to proceed.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `n` (the value of `candies`) needs to be greater than `0` for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state such that this condition is met.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be:

State: **`candies` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**, `vasya_eaten` is `0`, `petya_eaten` is `0`, `k` is increased by `1`.
