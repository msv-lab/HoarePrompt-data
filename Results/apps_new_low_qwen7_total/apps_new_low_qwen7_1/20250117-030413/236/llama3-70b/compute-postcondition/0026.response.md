`k` is incremented by 1. The values of `candies`, `vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, and the condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, and `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, `k` is increased by 1**
