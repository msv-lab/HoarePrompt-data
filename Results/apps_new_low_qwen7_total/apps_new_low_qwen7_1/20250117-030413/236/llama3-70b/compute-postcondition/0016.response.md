State right before the while loop: `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `k` is 2, `petya_eaten` is 0

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The condition for the loop to execute is `candies > 0`.
2. Currently, `candies` is 0, which means the loop condition is not satisfied.
3. To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `candies` is greater than 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, `candies` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`candies` must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `k` is 2, `petya_eaten` is 0**
