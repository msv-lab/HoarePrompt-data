Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state after all iterations.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while candies > 0:`. This means the loop will continue as long as there are candies available.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **vasya_eaten**: Increases by `min(k, candies)` in each iteration.
- **candies**: Decreases by `min(k, candies)` in each iteration.
- **petya_eaten**: Set to `candies // 10` after updating `candies` in each iteration.
- **k**: Remains constant throughout the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues until `candies` becomes zero. Each iteration of the loop:
1. Adds `min(k, candies)` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. Decreases `candies` by `min(k, candies)`.
3. Sets `petya_eaten` to `candies // 10` and decreases `candies` by this amount.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Let's verify the relationships and invariants:
- The loop stops when `candies` reaches zero.
- `vasya_eaten` increases by `k` each time until `candies` is depleted.
- `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10` after each iteration but only affects `candies`.

### Determine the Final Output State
Given the initial state: 
- `candies = 0`
- `vasya_eaten = 0`
- `k = 2`
- `petya_eaten = 0`

Since `candies` is initially 0, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, no changes occur to any of the variables.

### Final Output State
Output State: **candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0.**
