The only variable in the loop head is `candies`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `candies`. If `candies` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candies` is `n - k`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0.

State: **`candies` must be greater than 0**
