Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `candies > 0`.

2. **Analyze the Variables Involved**:
   - `candies`: This is the only variable involved in the loop condition.
   - `n`, `k`, and `vasya_eaten` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not affect whether the loop can execute the first time.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is 1.
   - `candies` is equal to `n`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is 0.

4. **Determine the Required State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `candies > 0` must be true.
   - Given that `candies` is initially equal to `n` and `n` is at least 1, `candies` is guaranteed to be greater than 0 initially.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `candies` starts as `n` and `n` is at least 1, the condition `candies > 0` is already satisfied initially.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is 1, `candies` is n, `vasya_eaten` is 0**
