Initial State: `vasya_eaten` is 2, `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies` is `candies - 2` and `candies` must be greater than 0

Given the initial state, we know `candies` starts as `candies - 2`, which means `candies` must have been at least 2 initially (since it cannot be negative). Let's denote the initial value of `candies` as `initial_candies`.

Let's analyze the code block:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`:
   - `k` is not defined, so we assume it refers to `candies`.
   - `min(k, candies)` simplifies to `min(candies, candies)`, which is `candies`.
   - This line adds `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`:
   - Similar to the first line, this subtracts `candies` from `candies`.
   - After this line, `candies` will be 0 because `candies - candies` equals 0.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`:
   - Since `candies` is now 0, dividing by 10 still results in 0.
   - `petya_eaten` becomes 0.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`:
   - Subtracting 0 from `candies` does not change its value.
   - `candies` remains 0.

After executing all lines, the final state is:
- `vasya_eaten` becomes `2 + initial_candies`.
- `petya_eaten` becomes 0.
- `candies` becomes 0.

Since the initial value of `candies` was `initial_candies`, and `initial_candies` must be at least 2, we can say `candies` is 0 and `vasya_eaten` is `2 + initial_candies`.

Output State: **vasya_eaten is 2 + initial_candies, petya_eaten is 0, candies is 0**
