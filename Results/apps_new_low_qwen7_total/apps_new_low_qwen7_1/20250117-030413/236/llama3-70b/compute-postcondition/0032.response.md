Initial State: `candies` must be greater than 0

Code Snippet:
```
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Analysis:
1. The first line updates `vasya_eaten` by adding the minimum value between `k` and `candies` to it.
2. The second line decreases `candies` by the minimum value between `k` and `candies`.
3. The third line sets `petya_eaten` to be `candies` divided by 10 (integer division).
4. The fourth line decreases `candies` by the value of `petya_eaten`.

Let's assume an initial value for `candies` (since it must be greater than 0, let's use 20 for demonstration purposes; the exact value doesn't change the process):

After the first line:
- `vasya_eaten` is updated by adding the minimum of `k` and `candies`. Let's assume `k` is 15 for this example.
- `vasya_eaten += min(15, 20) = vasya_eaten + 15`. If `vasya_eaten` was initially 0, then `vasya_eaten` becomes 15.

After the second line:
- `candies -= min(15, 20) = candies - 15`. So, `candies` becomes 20 - 15 = 5.

After the third line:
- `petya_eaten = candies // 10 = 5 // 10 = 0`. So, `petya_eaten` is set to 0.

After the fourth line:
- `candies -= petya_eaten = candies - 0 = candies - 0 = 5`. `candies` remains 5.

Final State: **candies is 5, vasya_eaten is 15, petya_eaten is 0**

Note: The actual values of `k` and `candy` should be used in place of assumptions, but the process described above will hold true for any valid `k` and `candies` values where `candies > 0`.
