The only variable in the loop head is `candies`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `candies`. If `candies` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candies` is `candies - 2`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `candies` is greater than 0.

State: **`vasya_eaten` is 2, `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies` is `candies - 2` and `candies` must be greater than 0**
