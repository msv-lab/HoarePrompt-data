The initial state is: `candies` must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `k` is 2, `petya_eaten` is 0.

Let's analyze the code:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - Since `k` is 2, `min(k, candies)` will be 2 if `candies` is at least 2, or `candies` if `candies` is less than 2. However, since we don't know the exact value of `candies`, we'll assume it is at least 2 for now (as per the precondition).
   - Let's assume `candies` is at least 2 (the smallest possible value satisfying the precondition), so `min(k, candies)` is 2.
   - Therefore, `vasya_eaten` becomes 2.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - After the previous line, `candies -= 2`, so `candies` becomes `candies - 2`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - Since `candies` is at least 2, after subtracting 2, `candies` could be 0 to 1 (if `candies` was 2) or 1 to 9 (if `candies` was more than 2). In either case, `candies // 10` will be 0 because the result of the floor division by 10 will be 0.
   - So, `petya_eaten` is 0.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - Since `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies` remains unchanged from the previous subtraction.

Now, let's summarize the final state:
- `vasya_eaten` is 2.
- `petya_eaten` is 0.
- `candies` is `candies - 2`, which could be any value from 0 to 9 depending on the initial value of `candies`.

Since we do not know the exact initial value of `candies`, we can express the final state as:
Output State: **vasya_eaten is 2, petya_eaten is 0, candies is candies - 2**
