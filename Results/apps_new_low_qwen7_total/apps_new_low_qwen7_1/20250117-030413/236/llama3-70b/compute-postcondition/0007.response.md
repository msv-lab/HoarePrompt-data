Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `candies > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `vasya_eaten` is 2.
   - `candies` has been reduced by 1 from its initial value.
   - `petya_eaten` is `(candies - 1) // 10`.
   - `n` has been reduced by 1 from its initial value.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- Since `candies` has been reduced by 1 from its initial value, let's denote the initial value of `candies` as `c_initial`. After the previous iteration, `candies` is `c_initial - 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `c_initial - 1` must be greater than 0. This means `c_initial` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `candies` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `c_initial` must be greater than 1.

Since no other variables in the loop head (i.e., `candies`) need adjustment beyond ensuring it is greater than 0, we don't need to change any other states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`vasya_eaten` is 2, `candies` is `c_initial - 1` and `c_initial` must be greater than 1, `petya_eaten` is `(c_initial - 2) // 10`, `n` is `n - 1`**
