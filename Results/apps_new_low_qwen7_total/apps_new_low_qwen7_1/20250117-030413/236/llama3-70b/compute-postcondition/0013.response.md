The value of `k` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their initial state because the code only affects `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `k` is 2, `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 2, `candies` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0**
