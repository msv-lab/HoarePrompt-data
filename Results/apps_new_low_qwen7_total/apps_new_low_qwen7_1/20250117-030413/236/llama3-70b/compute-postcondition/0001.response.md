Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

### Given Information:
- **State right before the while loop**: 
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
  - `k` is 1
- **Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  while True:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of (e.g., using `break`).

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is set to 1.

3. **Determining the Conditions for Execution**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, the loop will execute the first time regardless of the values of `n` and `k` as long as they are valid according to their constraints.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - There are no specific conditions required for the loop to execute the first time because `while True` will always evaluate to `True` at the start of each iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is 1**
