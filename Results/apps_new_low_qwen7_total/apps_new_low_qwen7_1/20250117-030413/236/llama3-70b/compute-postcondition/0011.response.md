The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is 0
- `k` is 1
- `candies` is 0
- `vasya_eaten` is 0
- `petya_eaten` is 0
- `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`

The code block consists of two lines:
1. `print(k)`
2. `break`

Let's analyze each line:

1. The first line prints the value of `k`, which is 1.
2. The second line, `break`, is typically used inside loops to exit the loop immediately. However, since there are no loops in this code block, it does not have any effect here.

After executing the code, the values of the variables do not change because none of the lines modify them. The only output produced is the value of `k`, which is 1.

Output State: **n is 0, k is 1, candies is 0, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0, vasya_eaten * 2 is greater than or equal to n**
