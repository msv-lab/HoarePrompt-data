You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    while True:
        candies = n
        vasya_eaten = 0
        while candies > 0:
            vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
            candies -= min(k, candies)
            petya_eaten = candies // 10
            candies -= petya_eaten
        if vasya_eaten * 2 >= n:
            print(k)
            break
        k += 1



- Function Summary: 
- The function does not handle the case where \( n \) might be negative or outside the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). However, given the problem constraints, it is safe to assume that valid input will always fall within this range.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Program Understanding**: The provided program aims to find the smallest integer \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies initially present in the box. Vasya eats \( k \) candies each morning, and Petya eats 10% of the remaining candies each evening, rounded down.

2. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The program initializes `k` to 1 and checks if the current value of `k` allows Vasya to eat at least half of the candies.
   - It simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies over multiple days.
   - Inside the loop, it keeps track of how many candies Vasya has eaten (`vasya_eaten`) and updates the count of candies left after each iteration.
   - Petya's consumption is calculated by taking 10% of the remaining candies, rounded down.
   - The loop continues to increment `k` until Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition where Petya does not eat any candies when there are fewer than 10 candies left.
   - The loop terminates once Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies, ensuring the smallest possible `k` is found.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `68`, the program correctly identifies `k = 3` as the minimum value needed for Vasya to eat at least half of the candies. The example provided in the problem statement matches this behavior.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.
