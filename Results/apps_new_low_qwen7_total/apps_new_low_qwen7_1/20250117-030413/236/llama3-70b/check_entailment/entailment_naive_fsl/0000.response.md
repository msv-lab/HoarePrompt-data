Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively increases the value of \( k \) until Vasya eats at least half of the candies. Here’s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts with \( k = 1 \).
2. **Main Loop**: It enters a loop where it simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
   - For each iteration, Vasya eats \( \min(k, \text{current\_candies}) \) candies.
   - Petya then eats \( \text{current\_candies} // 10 \) candies.
   - The process continues until no more candies are left.
3. **Check Condition**: After each complete cycle of Vasya and Petya eating, it checks if Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies. If so, it prints \( k \) and exits the loop.

The program handles all edge cases, such as when there are fewer than 10 candies left (Petya doesn’t eat any), and correctly calculates the total number of candies Vasya eats. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
