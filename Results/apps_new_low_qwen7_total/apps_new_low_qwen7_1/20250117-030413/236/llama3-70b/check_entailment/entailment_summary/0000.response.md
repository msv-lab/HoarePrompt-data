Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the initial number of candies `n` from the input.
2. **Loop to Find Minimal `k`**: It uses a loop to incrementally increase `k` starting from 1 until it finds the smallest `k` such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.
3. **Candy Consumption Simulation**: Inside the loop, it simulates the process of consuming candies:
   - `vasya_eaten` keeps track of the total candies eaten by Vasya.
   - In each iteration of the inner `while` loop, it ensures that Vasya eats up to `k` candies each morning, and then Petya eats 10% of the remaining candies (or less if not divisible by 10).
   - The process continues until no more candies are left in the box.
4. **Check Condition**: After one full simulation, it checks if the total candies eaten by Vasya (`vasya_eaten`) is at least half of the initial number of candies `n`. If true, it prints `k` and breaks the loop.

Given that the program follows the described process and the problem constraints, it should correctly find the minimal `k`.

Correctness: **True**
