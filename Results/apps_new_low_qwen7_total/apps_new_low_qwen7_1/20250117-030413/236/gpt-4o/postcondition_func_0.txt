The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), representing the initial amount of candies in the box. It uses binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True. If `n` is even, the function will correctly identify the smallest `x` where Vasya can eat half the candies. However, if `n` is odd, the function might miss the correct answer because it rounds down the middle value in the binary search. The function returns `left`, which is the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True.
