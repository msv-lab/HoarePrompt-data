Initial State: `n` is an integer, `total` is an integer equal to `n` and `total` is greater than 0, and `total` is greater than or equal to `k`

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
- The first line `vasya_eaten += k` adds the value of `k` to `vasya_eaten`. Since `vasya_eaten` is not initially defined, it will be set to `k`.
- The second line `total -= k` subtracts the value of `k` from `total`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `total` is an integer equal to `n` and is greater than 0.
- `total` is also greater than or equal to `k`.

Let's denote the initial value of `n` as `initial_n` and the initial value of `total` as `initial_total`, where `initial_total = initial_n`.

After running the code:
- `vasya_eaten` is now `k`.
- `total` is now `initial_total - k`, which simplifies to `n - k`.

Since `n` is equal to `total` initially, the new value of `total` is still an integer and is greater than 0 because `total` was initially greater than 0 and we are subtracting `k` (which is less than or equal to `total`).

Final Output State: **n is an integer, vasya_eaten is k, total is n - k**
