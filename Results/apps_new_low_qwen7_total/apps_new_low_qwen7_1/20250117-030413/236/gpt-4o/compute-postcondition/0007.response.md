First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: `n` is an integer, `total` is an integer equal to `n`, `vasya_eaten` is an integer.
- Code Snippet: `total -= total // 10`

This means that `total` is decreased by the integer division of `total` by 10.

Given the initial conditions, we have:
- `total` is equal to `n`.

Let's execute the code:
- `total -= total // 10` means `total` is now `total - (total // 10)`.

Since `total` is initially equal to `n`, we can substitute `n` in the equation:
- `total` becomes `n - (n // 10)`.

The value of `n // 10` is the integer part of `n / 10`. This operation reduces `total` by one-tenth of its value (rounded down).

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `total` is now `n - (n // 10)`.
- The values of `n` and `vasya_eaten` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `total` is `n - (n // 10)`, `vasya_eaten` is an integer.**
