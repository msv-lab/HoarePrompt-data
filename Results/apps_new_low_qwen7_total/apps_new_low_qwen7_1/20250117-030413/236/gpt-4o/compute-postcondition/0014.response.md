The initial state is such that `vasya_eaten` is either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k`, and `total` must be greater than 0.

The code block executes as follows:
1. `vasya_eaten += total`: This line adds the current value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. `total = 0`: This line sets `total` to 0.

Since `total` must be greater than 0 according to the precondition, the only way for this condition to be true before executing the code block is if `total` was set to a positive value just before this block was executed. However, within the block itself, `total` is explicitly set to 0. Therefore, the addition to `vasya_eaten` will be based on the previous value of `total` before it was set to 0.

Given the precondition and the code execution, the final state will reflect the addition of the previous value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`, followed by setting `total` to 0. 

Output State: **vasya_eaten is vasya_eaten + previous_total, total is 0**
