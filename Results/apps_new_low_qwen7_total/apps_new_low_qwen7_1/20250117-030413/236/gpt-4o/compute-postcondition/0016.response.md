Postcondition: ***`vasya_eaten` is either `vasya_eaten + previous_total` or `vasya_eaten + k`, `total` is either 0 or `initial_total - k`. If `total < k`, then `total` becomes 0 and `vasya_eaten` becomes `vasya_eaten + previous_total`. Otherwise, `total` becomes `initial_total - k` and `vasya_eaten` becomes `vasya_eaten + k`.***
