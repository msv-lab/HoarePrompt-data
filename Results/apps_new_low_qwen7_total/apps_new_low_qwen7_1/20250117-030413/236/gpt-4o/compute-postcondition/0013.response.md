To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `total > 0`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `total > 0`.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `total` has been updated to `total - total // 10`. This means `total` is reduced by a tenth of its current value.
3. **Loop Continuation**: For the loop to continue, `total` must still be greater than 0.

Given that `total` is reduced by `total // 10` in each iteration, the new value of `total` is `total - total // 10`. To ensure that the loop continues, the new value of `total` must still be greater than 0.

Let's denote the value of `total` after the previous iteration as `T`. After the reduction, the new value of `total` becomes `T - T // 10`.

For the loop to continue, the following condition must hold true:
\[ T - \left\lfloor \frac{T}{10} \right\rfloor > 0 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ T - \frac{T}{10} > 0 \]
\[ \frac{9T}{10} > 0 \]

Since `T` is positive (as `total` is always positive before reduction), this condition is satisfied. However, to explicitly ensure the loop continues, we need to guarantee that the reduced value of `total` remains positive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `total` itself, ensuring that after the reduction, it is still greater than 0.

**Answer**:
State: **`vasya_eaten` is either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k`; `total` must be greater than 0**
