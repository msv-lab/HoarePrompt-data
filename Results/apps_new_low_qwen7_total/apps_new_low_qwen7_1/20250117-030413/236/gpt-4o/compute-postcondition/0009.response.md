Initial State: `n` is an integer, `total` is `n - (n // 10)` and must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is an integer

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += total
total = 0
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += total` adds the current value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. The second line `total = 0` sets `total` to 0.

Since `total` is initially calculated as `n - (n // 10)` and must be greater than 0, we know `total` is a positive integer derived from `n`. After running the code, `vasya_eaten` will have its value incremented by the original `total`, and `total` itself will be set to 0.

Final Output State: **n is an integer, vasya_eaten is a positive integer equal to its original value plus total, total is 0, vasya_eaten is a positive integer**
