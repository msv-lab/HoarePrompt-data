Initial State: `vasya_eaten` is either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k`; `total` must be greater than 0

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
- The first line `vasya_eaten += k` increments `vasya_eaten` by the value of `k`.
- The second line `total -= k` decreases `total` by the value of `k`.

Since `total` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that after the second line, `total` is still greater than 0. However, the initial state condition does not specify a specific value for `total` or `k`, so we can assume that `total` is initially set to a value greater than `k` to satisfy the condition.

Let's denote the initial value of `vasya_eaten` as \( V \) (since it could be either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k`, we consider the general form).

After the first line, `vasya_eaten` becomes \( V + k \).
After the second line, `total` becomes \( \text{initial\_total} - k \), where `initial_total` is the value of `total` before the operation.

Since the exact initial value of `total` is not specified, we only know it was greater than `k`. Therefore, the final state will reflect the increments and decrements as described.

Final Output State: **vasya_eaten is V + k, total is initial_total - k**
