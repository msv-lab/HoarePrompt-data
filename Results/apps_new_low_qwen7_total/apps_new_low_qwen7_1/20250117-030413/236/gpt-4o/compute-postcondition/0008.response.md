The loop condition is `total > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `total` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

- The state of `n` and `vasya_eaten` does not affect the loop condition directly.
- The state of `total` must be such that it is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given that `total` is currently `n - (n // 10)`, for the loop to execute again, `total` must be greater than 0. This means:

- `n - (n // 10)` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `total` is greater than 0 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer, `total` is `n - (n // 10)` and must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is an integer**
