The code `total -= total // 10` updates `total` by subtracting `total` divided by 10 (integer division). This operation does not depend on the initial value of `total` being less than `k` or greater than or equal to `k`. It only modifies `total`.

- If the initial value of `total` was less than `k`, then `vasya_eaten` would have been updated to `vasya_eaten + total` and `total` would have been set to 0.
- After this line of code, regardless of the initial state of `total`, `vasya_eaten` will remain unchanged from its last update (if any), and `total` will be updated according to the given operation.

Let's summarize the changes:

- If the initial `total` was less than `k`, then `vasya_eaten` is now `vasya_eaten + total` and `total` is now 0.
- If the initial `total` was greater than or equal to `k`, then `vasya_eaten` is now `vasya_eaten + k` and `total` is now `n - floor(n / 10) - k`.
- In both cases, the new value of `total` is `total - total // 10`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `vasya_eaten` remains the same as before (either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k` depending on the initial condition).
- `total` is updated to `total - total // 10`.

Output State: **`vasya_eaten` is either `vasya_eaten + total` or `vasya_eaten + k`; `total` is `total - total // 10`.**
