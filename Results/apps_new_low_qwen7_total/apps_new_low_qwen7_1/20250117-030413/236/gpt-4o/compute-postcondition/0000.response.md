Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and `k` is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning.
```

Code Block:
```
total = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line assigns the value of `n` to `total`. This means `total` now holds the same value as `n`.
- The second line initializes `vasya_eaten` to 0, meaning Vasya has eaten no candies yet.

Final Output State: **n is an integer, total is an integer equal to n, vasya_eaten is 0**
