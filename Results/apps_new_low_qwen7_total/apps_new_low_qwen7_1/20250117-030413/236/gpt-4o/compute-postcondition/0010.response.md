Initial State: `n` is an integer, `total` is `n - (n // 10)` and must be greater than 0, `vasya_eaten` is an integer

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += k` increments `vasya_eaten` by the value of `k`.
2. The second line `total -= k` decrements `total` by the value of `k`.

Since the initial value of `total` is `n - (n // 10)`, which must be greater than 0, we can represent it as `total = n - floor(n / 10)`. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know that `total > 0`.

Let's denote the initial value of `vasya_eaten` as `v_e`. After executing the code block, the new value of `vasya_eaten` will be `v_e + k` and the new value of `total` will be `total - k`.

Final Output State: **n is an integer, vasya_eaten is v_e + k, total is n - floor(n / 10) - k**
