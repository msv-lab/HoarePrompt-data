You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

            total = 0

            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimal value of \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the initial candies.

1. **Binary Search for \( k \)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the smallest \( k \). This is a good approach since it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Check Function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**:
   - The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies over multiple days.
   - It correctly handles the case where the remaining candies are not divisible by 10 (Petya rounds down).
   - It returns `True` if Vasya eats at least half of the candies, which is done by checking if twice the amount of candies eaten by Vasya is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies \( n \).

3. **Validation of the Logic**:
   - The logic for simulating the eating process is correct. Both Vasya and Petya's actions are accurately modeled.
   - The rounding down when Petya takes candies is correctly implemented using `total // 10`.
   - The condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` ensures that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to find the minimal \( k \).

### Conclusion:
- The binary search approach in `func_1` combined with the accurate simulation in `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` ensures that the program finds the correct minimal \( k \).
