### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the given solution step-by-step:

1. **Binary Search Implementation (Function 1)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the smallest integer `k` such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.
   - The search space is defined between `1` and `n` (inclusive).
   - The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` is used to check if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with the given `k`.

2. **Validation Function (Function 2)**:
   - The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` accurately simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies over multiple days.
   - It correctly accounts for the fact that Petya removes 10% of the remaining candies after each day, and rounds down when necessary.
   - The function checks if the total amount of candies Vasya eats is at least half of the initial amount `n`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, the function should return `False` because Vasya cannot eat any candies.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, Vasya will eat all the candies in one day. This edge case is handled correctly by the function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`.

Given the binary search implementation in `func_1` and the validation logic in `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`, the program correctly finds the minimal `k` such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal `k` for Vasya to eat at least half of the candies. Both functions work as intended, and the overall logic is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
