### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimal value of \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the initial candies.

1. **Binary Search for \( k \)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the smallest \( k \). This is a good approach since it efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Check Function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**:
   - The function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies over multiple days.
   - It correctly handles the case where the remaining candies are not divisible by 10 (Petya rounds down).
   - It returns `True` if Vasya eats at least half of the candies, which is done by checking if twice the amount of candies eaten by Vasya is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies \( n \).

3. **Validation of the Logic**:
   - The logic for simulating the eating process is correct. Both Vasya and Petya's actions are accurately modeled.
   - The rounding down when Petya takes candies is correctly implemented using `total // 10`.
   - The condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` ensures that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to find the minimal \( k \).

### Conclusion:
- The binary search approach in `func_1` combined with the accurate simulation in `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` ensures that the program finds the correct minimal \( k \).

**Correctness: True**
