 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    print(func_1(n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):

    (left, right) = (1, n)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), representing the initial amount of candies in the box. It uses binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True. If `n` is even, the function will correctly identify the smallest `x` where Vasya can eat half the candies. However, if `n` is odd, the function might miss the correct answer because it rounds down the middle value in the binary search. The function returns `left`, which is the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n
    vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        total -= total // 10
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k`, which represents the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning. It calculates the total number of candies Vasya eats over a series of days, where each day Vasya eats `k` candies unless the remaining candies in the box are less than `k`, in which case Vasya eats all the remaining candies. After each day, 10% of the candies are removed from the box. The function then checks if twice the amount of candies Vasya has eaten is greater than or equal to the initial amount of candies in the box (`n`). If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles the following cases:
1. When the remaining candies in the box are less than `k`, Vasya eats all the remaining candies.
2. After each day, 10% of the candies are removed from the box.
3. The function returns `True` if `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `False`.

Edge cases to consider:
- If `n` is 0, Vasya cannot eat any candies, and the function should return `False`.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, Vasya will eat all the candies in one day, and the function should return `True` if `n` is even and `False` if `n` is odd (since `vasya_eaten * 2` would be `n` in the former case and `n + 1` in the latter).
