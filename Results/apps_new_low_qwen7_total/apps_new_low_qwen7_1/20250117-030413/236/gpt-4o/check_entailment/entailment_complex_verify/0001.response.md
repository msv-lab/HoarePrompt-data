### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### Binary Search Approach (`func_1`)

1. **Initial State**: The function `func_1` initializes `left` to 1 and `right` to `n`. The goal is to find the smallest integer `k` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True`.

2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues as long as `left < right`. Inside the loop:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - Check if `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`. If it does, update `right` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, update `left` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Final Return**: After the loop, `left` will be the smallest integer such that `can_vasya_eat_half(left)` is `True`.

#### Simulation of Eating Process (`can_vasya_eat_half`)

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `total` set to `n` and `vasya_eaten` set to 0.

2. **Loop Until No Candies Left**:
   - If `total < k`, Vasya eats all remaining candies, and the loop exits.
   - Otherwise, Vasya eats `k` candies, and the remaining candies are reduced by `k`.
   - Petya then eats 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down using integer division).

3. **Check Condition**: After the loop, check if twice the amount of candies Vasya has eaten is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`.

#### Edge Cases

1. **Initial Candies Zero**: If `n` is 0, Vasya cannot eat any candies, and the function should return `False`.

2. **Large `k` Values**: If `k` is very large (e.g., `k >= n`), Vasya will eat all the candies in one day. The function needs to handle this correctly:
   - If `n` is even, `vasya_eaten * 2` will be exactly `n`, so it should return `True`.
   - If `n` is odd, `vasya_eaten * 2` will be `n + 1`, so it should return `False`.

#### Validation

1. **Correct Binary Search**: The binary search approach is correct and efficient. It ensures that the minimal `k` is found.

2. **Accurate Simulation**: The `can_vasya_eat_half` function correctly models the eating process, including the rounding down for Petya's consumption.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 0 or when `k` is very large.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the initial candies. The binary search and the simulation are both accurate and handle edge cases properly.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
