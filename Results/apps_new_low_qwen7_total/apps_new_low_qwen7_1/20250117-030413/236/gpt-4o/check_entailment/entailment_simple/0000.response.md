Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both functions (`func_1` and `can_vasya_eat_half`) are implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

1. **Understanding `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**:
   - This function checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies given `k` (the number of candies Vasya eats each morning).
   - The function iterates over the candies, simulating Vasya's and Petya's actions each day.
   - It ensures that Petya always gets 10% of the remaining candies rounded down, and it checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the initial candies.
   - The logic inside this function seems to be correctly implementing the described process.

2. **Understanding `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum `k` such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.
   - The function initializes `left` to 1 and `right` to `n`, and it narrows down the range by checking `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` for the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
   - If `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` is true, it means `mid` or a smaller value might be the answer, so it sets `right` to `mid`. Otherwise, it sets `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - The loop continues until `left` equals `right`, at which point `left` will be the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is true.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The binary search approach in `func_1` is appropriate for finding the smallest `k`.
   - The `can_vasya_eat_half` function correctly simulates the process and returns the necessary condition.

Given that both functions seem to correctly implement the described logic, and there are no apparent errors in the logic flow, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
