#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, representing the initial amount of candies in the box.
def func_1(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left` is the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True, and `right` is equal to `left`.
    return left
    #`The program returns left which is the smallest integer x such that can_vasya_eat_half(x) is True`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), representing the initial amount of candies in the box. It uses binary search to find the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True. If `n` is even, the function will correctly identify the smallest `x` where Vasya can eat half the candies. However, if `n` is odd, the function might miss the correct answer because it rounds down the middle value in the binary search. The function returns `left`, which is the smallest integer `x` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(x)` is True.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and k is an integer representing the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning.
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n

vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `vasya_eaten` is an integer that represents the cumulative amount added during the loop iterations.
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
    #The program returns True if vasya_eaten * 2 is greater than or equal to n, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k`, which represents the amount of candies Vasya eats each morning. It calculates the total number of candies Vasya eats over a series of days, where each day Vasya eats `k` candies unless the remaining candies in the box are less than `k`, in which case Vasya eats all the remaining candies. After each day, 10% of the candies are removed from the box. The function then checks if twice the amount of candies Vasya has eaten is greater than or equal to the initial amount of candies in the box (`n`). If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles the following cases:
1. When the remaining candies in the box are less than `k`, Vasya eats all the remaining candies.
2. After each day, 10% of the candies are removed from the box.
3. The function returns `True` if `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `False`.

Edge cases to consider:
- If `n` is 0, Vasya cannot eat any candies, and the function should return `False`.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, Vasya will eat all the candies in one day, and the function should return `True` if `n` is even and `False` if `n` is odd (since `vasya_eaten * 2` would be `n` in the former case and `n + 1` in the latter).
