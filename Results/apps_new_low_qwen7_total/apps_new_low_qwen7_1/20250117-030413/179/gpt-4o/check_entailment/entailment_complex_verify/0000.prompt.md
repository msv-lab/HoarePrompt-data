You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of decimal digits. The string s starts with the digit 8.
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())

s = input().strip()

moves = (n - 11) // 2

count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if (count_8 > moves) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5 - 11, `s` is a string of length `n-11` consisting only of decimal digits starting with '8', `moves` is an integer calculated as (`n - 11`) // 2, `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n-11]`. If `count_8` is greater than `moves`, the string 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts an odd integer `n` such that \(13 \leq n < 10^5\) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, where `s` starts with the digit '8'. It then calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` from the start up to the character before the last 11 characters. If the count of '8's in this substring is greater than half of the length of this substring (i.e., \((n - 11) // 2\)), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input string `s` or the integer `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program checks if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given problem description. Here’s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
2. **Counting '8's**: It calculates the number of '8's in the initial part of the string (`s[:n - 11]`). This is necessary because Vasya needs at least `moves` number of '8's to ensure he can always make a move that leaves the string as a valid phone number.
3. **Winning Condition Check**: It checks if the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves required to reduce the string length from `n` to 11. If so, Vasya has a winning strategy; otherwise, Petya does.

Given the logic:
- If there are more than `(n - 11) // 2` '8's in the initial part of the string, Vasya can always pick an '8' to keep reducing the string towards a valid phone number.
- If there are fewer '8's, Petya can strategically remove '8's to prevent Vasya from forming a valid phone number.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether Vasya has a winning strategy for any given input. Therefore, the program is correct.
