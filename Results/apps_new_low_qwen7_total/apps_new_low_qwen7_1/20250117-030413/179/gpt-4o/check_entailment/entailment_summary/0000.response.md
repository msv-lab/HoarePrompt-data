Reasoning:
The provided program logic is aimed at determining whether Vasya has a winning strategy. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the string `s`.
2. **Move Calculation**: The number of moves needed for the game to reach 11 characters is calculated using \((n - 11) // 2\). This is the total number of moves both players will make.
3. **Count of '8's**: The program counts how many times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` from the start up to the character before the last 11 characters. This is necessary because Vasya's goal is to ensure that after making the required number of moves, the resulting string starts with '8' and consists of exactly 11 digits.
4. **Winning Condition**: If the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always pick an '8' on each of his turns, ensuring that he leaves Petya with a string starting with '8' and having exactly 11 digits, thus winning the game. Otherwise, Petya can force a win by preventing the formation of a valid telephone number.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program correctly implements the solution. The key points to verify are:
- The calculation of moves is accurate.
- The count of '8's in the relevant substring is correctly used to determine the possibility of Vasya winning.

Since the provided logic accurately reflects the winning condition, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
