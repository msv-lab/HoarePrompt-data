Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program checks if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
2. **Counting '8's**: It calculates the number of '8's in the initial part of the string (`s[:n - 11]`). This is necessary because Vasya needs at least `moves` number of '8's to ensure he can always make a move that leaves the string as a valid phone number.
3. **Winning Condition Check**: It checks if the count of '8's is greater than the number of moves required to reduce the string length from `n` to 11. If so, Vasya has a winning strategy; otherwise, Petya does.

Given the logic:
- If there are more than `(n - 11) // 2` '8's in the initial part of the string, Vasya can always pick an '8' to keep reducing the string towards a valid phone number.
- If there are fewer '8's, Petya can strategically remove '8's to prevent Vasya from forming a valid phone number.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether Vasya has a winning strategy for any given input. Therefore, the program is correct.
