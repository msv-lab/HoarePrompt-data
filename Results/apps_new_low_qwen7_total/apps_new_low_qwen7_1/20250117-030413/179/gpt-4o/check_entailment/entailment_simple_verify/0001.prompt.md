You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of decimal digits. The string s starts with the digit 8.
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())

s = input().strip()

moves = (n - 11) // 2

count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if (count_8 > moves) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5 - 11, `s` is a string of length `n-11` consisting only of decimal digits starting with '8', `moves` is an integer calculated as (`n - 11`) // 2, `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n-11]`. If `count_8` is greater than `moves`, the string 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to analyze whether he can force the resulting string to be a valid telephone number after both players have made their moves.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Game Parameters**:
   - The initial string `s` has an odd length `n`.
   - The final length should be 11 digits.
   - Vasya and Petya each make `(n - 11) / 2` moves, as the total number of moves required to reduce the string from `n` to 11 is `(n - 11)`, and they take turns.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - A valid telephone number starts with '8' and consists of exactly 11 digits.
   - To ensure Vasya wins, he must be able to guarantee that the remaining 11-character substring will start with '8'.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code calculates the number of moves each player will make, which is correctly determined as `(n - 11) // 2`.
   - It then counts the number of '8's in the initial substring of length `n - 11`.
   - The logic checks if the count of '8's (`count_8`) is greater than the number of moves (`moves`). This ensures that Vasya can always pick an '8' before Petya, thereby ensuring the final 11-character substring will start with '8'.

### Verification:
- If `count_8 > moves`, it means Vasya can always choose an '8', thus guaranteeing a valid telephone number.
- Otherwise, Petya can prevent Vasya from achieving a valid telephone number by strategically removing non-'8' characters.

Given this analysis, the code logic correctly implements the condition for Vasya to have a winning strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution accurately determines whether Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given conditions. Therefore, the code is correct.
