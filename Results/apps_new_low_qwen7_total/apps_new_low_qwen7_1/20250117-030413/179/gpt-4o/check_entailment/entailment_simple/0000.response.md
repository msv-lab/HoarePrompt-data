### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy in the game. Vasya wins if the final string (of length 11) forms a telephone number starting with '8'.
   - The initial string \( s \) has length \( n \), and \( n \) is odd. The game proceeds with alternating moves where each player removes one character until the string length is 11.
   - The key is to ensure that after \( n - 11 \) moves, the remaining string still contains at least one '8' to form a valid telephone number.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - There are \( n - 11 \) moves in total, and since players take turns, Vasya will make \( \frac{n - 11}{2} \) moves, and Petya will make the same number of moves.
   - To guarantee a win, Vasya must ensure that the number of '8's left after his moves is more than the number of moves he can make, i.e., \( \text{count\_8} > \frac{n - 11}{2} \).

3. **Code Verification**:
   - The code correctly calculates the number of moves \( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \).
   - It counts the number of '8's in the initial substring \( s[:n - 11] \) to check if Vasya can always leave at least one '8' for the final string.
   - If \( \text{count\_8} > \text{moves} \), Vasya has a winning strategy and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( n \) is odd and \( 13 \leq n < 10^5 \). It correctly counts the necessary '8's in the initial substring to determine the outcome.

Given this analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy.
