Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Vasya can guarantee a win by ensuring that after removing characters, the remaining string is a valid telephone number (i.e., starts with '8' and has exactly 11 digits).
2. **Key Logic**: 
   - The initial string \( s \) is of length \( n \), and the game ends when the length of \( s \) reduces to 11.
   - Vasya and Petya take turns removing one character each until the length is 11.
   - Vasya wins if the resulting string is a valid telephone number (starts with '8' and has exactly 11 digits).

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The key observation is that if there are more than \((n - 11) // 2\) occurrences of '8' in the initial string \( s \) (excluding the last 11 characters), Vasya can always ensure that an '8' remains at the start of the final 11-character string.
   - This is because each removal by either player reduces the total count of '8's by at most 1, and since Vasya goes first, he can strategically remove non-'8' characters to keep at least one '8' in the leading position if possible.

4. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The program correctly calculates \((n - 11) // 2\) as the maximum number of moves any player can make without making the string invalid.
   - It then counts the number of '8's in the substring of \( s \) that excludes the last 11 characters.
   - If the count of '8's is greater than \((n - 11) // 2\), it implies Vasya can always ensure the leading '8' remains, thus guaranteeing a win.

Based on the above analysis, the logic in the provided program correctly determines if Vasya has a winning strategy.

Correctness: **True**
