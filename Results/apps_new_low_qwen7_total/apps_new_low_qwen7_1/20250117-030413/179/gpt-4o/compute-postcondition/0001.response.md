Postcondition: **`n` is an odd integer such that 13 â‰¤ n < 10^5 - 11, `s` is a string of length n-11 consisting only of decimal digits starting with '8', `moves` is an integer calculated as (n - 11) // 2, `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n-11]`. The current value of `count_8` is greater than `moves`.**
