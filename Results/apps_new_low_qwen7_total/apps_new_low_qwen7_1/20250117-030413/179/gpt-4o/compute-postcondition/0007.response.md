Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts an odd integer `n` such that \(13 \leq n < 10^5\) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits, where `s` starts with the digit '8'. It then calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` from the start up to the character before the last 11 characters. If the count of '8's in this substring is greater than half of the length of this substring (i.e., \((n - 11) // 2\)), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input string `s` or the integer `n`.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If \(n = 13\), the substring considered is of length 2 (since \(13 - 11 = 2\)). In this case, the function checks if there is at least one '8' in these two characters.
- If the substring consists entirely of '8's, the function will still correctly determine whether the count of '8's exceeds \((n - 11) // 2\).
- If \(n = 10^5 - 1\), the substring considered is very long, but the function will still accurately count the occurrences of '8' and compare them with \((n - 11) // 2\).
