The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 13 â‰¤ n < 10^5 - 11, `s` is a string of length n-11 consisting only of decimal digits starting with '8', `moves` is an integer calculated as (n - 11) // 2, `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n-11]`, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
