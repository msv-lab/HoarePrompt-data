The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an odd integer such that 13 ≤ n < 10^5, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of decimal digits. The string `s` starts with the digit 8. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.
