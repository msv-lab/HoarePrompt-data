#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, and a 2D list of strings representing the star map where each string contains exactly m characters consisting only of '.' and '*', with at least one '*' present in the map.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

stars = []
    for _ in range(n):
        row = input()
        
        for j, c in enumerate(row):
            if c == '*':
                stars.append((j, _))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `m` is a positive integer (which remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop), `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, and `row` is the input string corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs `n` times.
    #   - In each iteration, `row` is read from input.
    #   - For each character `c` in `row`, if `c` is '*', its index `j` and the character itself are appended to the `stars` list.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` is the number of iterations of the outer loop.
    #   - `m` is a positive integer that is not used in the loop and thus remains unchanged.
    #   - `stars` accumulates pairs `(j, c)` for every '*' character found in each `row`.
    #   - `row` changes with each iteration but retains the value from the last iteration after the loop completes.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop runs `n` times, reading a new `row` each time.
    #   - Each `row` is processed to find '*' characters and their positions, updating `stars` accordingly.
    #   - After `n` iterations, `stars` will contain all positions of '*' characters from all `rows`.
    #   - `row` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationships between variables are consistent with the described behavior. The loop iterates `n` times, processing each `row` to collect '*' positions, and `row` retains the last input string after all iterations.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state accurately reflects the number of iterations (`n`), the constant `m`, the list of star positions (`stars`), and the last input string (`row`).
    min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)

max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)

min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)

max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)

side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)

print(side)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a 2D list of strings representing a star map, where each string contains exactly `m` characters consisting only of '.' and '*', and there is at least one '*' present in the map. It first collects the positions of all '*' characters in the map by iterating through each row. After identifying the positions of all '*' characters, it calculates the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can enclose all these stars. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the stars, and then determining the side length of the rectangle, which is the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates plus one. Finally, the function prints the side length of this enclosing rectangle. Potential edge cases include maps with multiple stars, and the function correctly handles such cases by ensuring all stars are considered. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
