### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the star map from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
   
2. **Finding Star Coordinates**: It iterates over each row of the input and finds the coordinates of all stars ('*') on the map. These coordinates are stored in the `stars` list.

3. **Determining Minimum and Maximum X and Y Coordinates**: 
   - `min_x` and `max_x` store the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of the stars.
   - `min_y` and `max_y` store the minimum and maximum y-coordinates of the stars.

4. **Calculating the Side Length of the Smallest Square**:
   - The side length of the smallest square that can cover all the stars is calculated as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates plus one (`max_x - min_x + 1`).
   - Similarly, it calculates the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates plus one (`max_y - min_y + 1`).
   - The side length of the square is determined as the maximum of these two values, ensuring that the square can cover all stars.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated side length.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 4
     ....
     ..*.
     ...*
     ..**
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     3
     ```
   - Explanation: The stars are at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). The smallest square that covers all these stars has a side length of 3.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 3
     *.*
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     3
     ```
   - Explanation: The stars are at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2). The smallest square that covers all these stars has a side length of 3.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2 1
     .
     *
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Explanation: The star is at position (1,0). The smallest square that covers this star has a side length of 1.

The program handles the examples correctly, and the logic seems sound. Given that the program follows the correct approach to find the minimum side length of a square that can cover all stars, the solution appears to be correct.
