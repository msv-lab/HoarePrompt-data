Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `_` (a placeholder for the loop variable, often used when the loop variable itself is not needed), `n`, and `m`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `for _ in range(n)`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged.
   - `row` is the original input string.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and not a variable being modified within the loop, it doesn't affect the loop continuation.
   - The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - After one iteration of the loop, `n` will be decremented by 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

5. **New State After One Iteration**:
   - `n` must be decremented by 1, so if it was originally `n`, now it must be `n-1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `stars` and `row` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, `row` is the original input string.**
