Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `c` using the `enumerate(row)` function.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `row` must have at least one character.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `c` is the first character in the string `row`.
   - If `c` is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*') ]`.

3. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `row` to enumerate.
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and `c` is the first character, the loop can continue if `row` has more than one character.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `j` should be incremented by 1 since it started at 0 and will now be 1.
   - `c` will now be the second character in `row`.
   - If the first character was '*', `stars` is `[ (0, '*') ]`. For the next character, `stars` should be updated accordingly. If the second character is also '*', `stars` will be `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`. Otherwise, `stars` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `row` must still have at least one character.
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `c` will be the second character in `row`.
   - If the second character is '*', `stars` will be `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `row` must have at least one character, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in the string `row`. If the second character is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`. Otherwise, the values of `row`, `j`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
