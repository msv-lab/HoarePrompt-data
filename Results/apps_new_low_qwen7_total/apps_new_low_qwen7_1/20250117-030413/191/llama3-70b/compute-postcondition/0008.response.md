`stars` is a list containing one tuple `(j, _)`. The code appends another tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `row` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list containing two tuples `[ (j, _), (j, _) ]`, `row` is the remaining part of the original `row` minus the first character, that must have at least one character.**
