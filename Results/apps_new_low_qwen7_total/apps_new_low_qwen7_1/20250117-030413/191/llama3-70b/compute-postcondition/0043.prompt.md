You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, and a 2D list of strings representing the star map where each string contains exactly m characters consisting only of '.' and '*', with at least one '*' present in the map.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

stars = []
    for _ in range(n):
        row = input()
        
        for j, c in enumerate(row):
            if c == '*':
                stars.append((j, _))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `m` is a positive integer (which remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop), `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, and `row` is the input string corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs `n` times.
    #   - In each iteration, `row` is read from input.
    #   - For each character `c` in `row`, if `c` is '*', its index `j` and the character itself are appended to the `stars` list.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` is the number of iterations of the outer loop.
    #   - `m` is a positive integer that is not used in the loop and thus remains unchanged.
    #   - `stars` accumulates pairs `(j, c)` for every '*' character found in each `row`.
    #   - `row` changes with each iteration but retains the value from the last iteration after the loop completes.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop runs `n` times, reading a new `row` each time.
    #   - Each `row` is processed to find '*' characters and their positions, updating `stars` accordingly.
    #   - After `n` iterations, `stars` will contain all positions of '*' characters from all `rows`.
    #   - `row` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationships between variables are consistent with the described behavior. The loop iterates `n` times, processing each `row` to collect '*' positions, and `row` retains the last input string after all iterations.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state accurately reflects the number of iterations (`n`), the constant `m`, the list of star positions (`stars`), and the last input string (`row`).
    min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)

max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)

min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)

max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)

side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)

print(side)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a 2D list of strings representing a star map, where each string contains exactly `m` characters consisting only of '.' and '*', and there is at least one '*' present in the map. It returns the coordinates (row and column indices) of the first '*' encountered in the star map.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
