`stars` is a list, and it appends a tuple `(j, _)`. The value of `j` is `j_prev + 1`, so `j` becomes `j_prev + 1`. The value of `_` is the character at index `j_prev + 1` in `row`, so `j` and `_` are added to the `stars` list. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list containing a new tuple `(j_prev + 1, character at index j_prev + 1 in row)`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `c` is the character at index `j_prev + 1` in `row`**
