The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `c`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `c`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `row` is the new input string,
- `j` is 1 (indicating the first character was processed),
- `c` is the second character in `row`.

If `c` is not '*', then `stars` is updated to `[ (1, c) ]`. If `c` is '*', then `stars` is updated to `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ].

Let's assume `c` is not '*'. Therefore, `stars` is updated to `[ (1, c) ]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
- `c` will be the third character in `row`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and `c` is the third character in `row`.**
