The code appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Since `_` is not defined and usually refers to the second argument in a function call or context where it's used implicitly, here it likely refers to the current value of `c`, which is '*'. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, and `c` is '*', so the tuple appended to `stars` will be `(0, '*')`.

The output state after executing the code will include the updated `stars` list and the unchanged values of `row`, `j`, and `c`.

Output State: **`row` must have at least one character, `j` is 0, `c` is '*', `stars` is `[ (0, '*') ]`**
