The loop head involves the variables `j` and `c` from the `enumerate(row)` expression. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head `for (j, c) in enumerate(row):` indicates that the variables `j` and `c` are being updated within each iteration of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `stars` is a list.
   - If `c` equals '*', `stars` is updated to contain two tuples `[ (j, _), (j, _) ]`.
   - Otherwise, the state of `n`, `m`, `stars`, and `row` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` and `c` are being updated within the loop, we need to consider how they change.
   - `j` represents the index of the current element in the `row` list, so it will increase by 1 after each iteration.
   - `c` is the character at the current index `j` in the `row` list.

Given that the loop updates `j` and checks if `c` equals '*', if `c` equals '*', then `stars` is updated. Otherwise, the states of `n`, `m`, `stars`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Since the loop is just starting, we assume the worst-case scenario where `c` does not equal '*', meaning the states of `n`, `m`, `stars`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `j` increasing by 1 from its previous value.

Let's denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `c` is the character at index `j_prev + 1` in `row`**
