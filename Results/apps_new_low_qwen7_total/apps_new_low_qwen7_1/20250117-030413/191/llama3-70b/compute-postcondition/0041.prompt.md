You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: `n` is the number of times the loop executed, `m` is a positive integer (which remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop), `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, and `row` is the input string corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, `row` is read from input.
   - For each character `c` in `row`, if `c` is '*', its index `j` and the character itself are appended to the `stars` list.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` is the number of iterations of the outer loop.
   - `m` is a positive integer that is not used in the loop and thus remains unchanged.
   - `stars` accumulates pairs `(j, c)` for every '*' character found in each `row`.
   - `row` changes with each iteration but retains the value from the last iteration after the loop completes.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, reading a new `row` each time.
   - Each `row` is processed to find '*' characters and their positions, updating `stars` accordingly.
   - After `n` iterations, `stars` will contain all positions of '*' characters from all `rows`.
   - `row` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships between variables are consistent with the described behavior. The loop iterates `n` times, processing each `row` to collect '*' positions, and `row` retains the last input string after all iterations.

Thus, the final output state accurately reflects the number of iterations (`n`), the constant `m`, the list of star positions (`stars`), and the last input string (`row`).
```
min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)
max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)
min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)
max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)
side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)
print(side)

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
```
