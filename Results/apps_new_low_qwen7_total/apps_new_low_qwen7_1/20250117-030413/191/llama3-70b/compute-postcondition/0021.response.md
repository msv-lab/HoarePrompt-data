The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, c)` to the list `stars`. From the previous state, we know that `j` is 1 and `c` is the second character in `row`. The variable `_` is actually the same as `c`, which is the second character in `row`.

Therefore, the tuple `(j, c)` is appended to `stars`, making the new state of `stars` as `[ (0, '*') ]` if the second character is '*', otherwise it will remain `[ (0, '*') ]` if the second character is not '*'. However, since we are updating the state for the next iteration, we consider the case where `c` is the second character.

Output State: **`row` must have at least one character, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in the string `row`, `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, c) ]` if the second character is '*', otherwise `stars` remains `[ (0, '*') ]`.**
