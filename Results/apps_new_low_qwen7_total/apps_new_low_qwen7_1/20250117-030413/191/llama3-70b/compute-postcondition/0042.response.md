The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. It works with a 2D list of strings representing a star map, where each string contains exactly `m` characters consisting only of '.' and '*', and there is at least one '*' present in the map. The function returns the coordinates (row and column indices) of the first '*' encountered in the star map.
