Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, `row` is the original input string.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `row` using `enumerate` to get both the index `j` and the character `c`.
   - If the character `c` is '*', the tuple `(j, c)` is appended to the list `stars`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `n` and `m` are not mentioned in the code and remain unchanged as there are no operations on them inside the loop.
   - **Variable `stars`**: This list is modified if the condition `c == '*'` is met, appending a new tuple `(j, c)` to it.
   - **Variable `row`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is only used to check characters, not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to iterate over each character in `row` until it reaches the end of the string.
   - For each character `c` that equals '*', the current index `j` and the character itself are added as a tuple to `stars`.
   - If `c` is not '*', no action is taken and the list `stars` remains unchanged for that iteration.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After all iterations, `stars` will contain tuples `(j, c)` for every '*' character found in `row`.
   - The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged and `row` also remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

This confirms that the final state of the variables after the loop has executed is as described above.
