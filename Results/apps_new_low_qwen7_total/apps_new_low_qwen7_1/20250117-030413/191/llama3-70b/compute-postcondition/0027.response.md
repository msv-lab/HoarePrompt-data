The only variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a dummy variable used for iteration) and `n`. Since the dummy variable `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to consider `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `row` is the input string
- `n` is the length of `row`
- `m` is a positive integer
- `stars` is a list of tuples containing indices `j` and the corresponding character `c` from `row` if `c` is '*', and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs for `range(n)` iterations.

Given that the loop ran once in the previous iteration, `n` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be `n - 1`.

So, the state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`row` is the input string, `n` is the length of `row` minus 1, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list of tuples containing indices `j` and the corresponding character `c` from `row` if `c` is '*', and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1` inclusive**.
