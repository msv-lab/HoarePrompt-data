`row` is assigned the value of the input, which is read from the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, and `stars` remains unchanged unless the input string `row` contains the character '*'. In that case, `stars` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged, `row` is the input string from the user.**
