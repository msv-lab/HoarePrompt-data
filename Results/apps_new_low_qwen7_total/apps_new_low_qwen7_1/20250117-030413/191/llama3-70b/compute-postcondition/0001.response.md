Let's break down the given scenario step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `stars` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop uses `_` as the loop variable. Since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (not used within the loop body), we focus on the `range(n)` part. This means the loop will run `n` times.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0. Since `n` is already stated as a positive integer, the condition `n > 0` is inherently satisfied.

3. **Objects Controlled by the Loop**: Although `_` is not used inside the loop, the loop itself relies on the value of `n`. There are no other variables directly controlling the loop execution based on the provided code.

4. **State of Variables at the Start of the First Iteration**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `m` remains a positive integer (it does not affect the loop execution).
   - `stars` is an empty list and remains unchanged during the loop initialization phase.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the only condition that must be satisfied is that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. However, since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, this condition is inherently met.

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is an empty list**
