Functionality: **The function processes a 2D list of strings representing a star map, where each string contains exactly `m` characters consisting only of '.' and '*', and there is at least one '*' present in the map. It first collects the positions of all '*' characters in the map by iterating through each row. After identifying the positions of all '*' characters, it calculates the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can enclose all these stars. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the stars, and then determining the side length of the rectangle, which is the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates plus one. Finally, the function prints the side length of this enclosing rectangle. Potential edge cases include maps with multiple stars, and the function correctly handles such cases by ensuring all stars are considered. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
