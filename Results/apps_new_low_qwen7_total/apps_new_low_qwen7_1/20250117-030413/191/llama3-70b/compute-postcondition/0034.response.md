The code appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Here, `_` is the value of `c` (the second character in `row`). Since `j` is 1, the tuple to be appended is `(1, c)`.

- If `c` is '*', then `stars` was initially `[ (0, '*') ]`. After appending `(1, '*')`, `stars` becomes `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.
- If `c` is not '*', then `stars` was initially `[]`. After appending `(1, c)`, `stars` becomes `[ (1, c) ]`.

Since the initial value of `c` depends on the second character in `row`, let's consider both cases:

- If `c` is '*', the Output State is: `row` is the new input string, `j` is 1, `c` is '*', `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.
- If `c` is not '*', the Output State is: `row` is the new input string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in `row`, `stars` is `[ (1, c) ]`.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the Output State should cover both possibilities:

Output State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in `row`, `stars` is `[ (1, c) ]` if `c` is not '*', otherwise `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]**.
