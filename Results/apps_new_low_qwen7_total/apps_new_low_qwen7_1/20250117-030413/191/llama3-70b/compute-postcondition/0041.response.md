Given the initial state and the provided code block, let's analyze the effect of each line on the variables and determine the final output state.

**Initial State:**
- `n` is the number of times the loop executed.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index `j` (from the `enumerate` function) and the corresponding character `c` from the string `row` if `c` equals '*', otherwise `stars` remains unchanged.
- `row` is the input string corresponding to the last iteration of the loop.

**Code Block:**
```python
min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)
max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)
min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)
max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)
side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)
print(side)
```

**Analysis:**
1. **`min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)`**: This line calculates the minimum x-coordinate (first element of each tuple in `stars`) and assigns it to `min_x`.
2. **`max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)`**: This line calculates the maximum x-coordinate (first element of each tuple in `stars`) and assigns it to `max_x`.
3. **`min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)`**: This line calculates the minimum y-coordinate (second element of each tuple in `stars`) and assigns it to `min_y`.
4. **`max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)`**: This line calculates the maximum y-coordinate (second element of each tuple in `stars`) and assigns it to `max_y`.
5. **`side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)`**: This line calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the points represented by the tuples in `stars`. It uses the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates, adding 1 to each difference.
6. **`print(side)`**: This line prints the calculated side length.

**Final Output State:**
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.
- `stars` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the code.
- `row` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.
- `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `stars`.
- `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `stars`.
- `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `stars`.
- `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `stars`.
- `side` is the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the points in `stars`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is the number of times the loop executed, m is a positive integer, stars is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index j and the corresponding character c from the string row if c equals '*', otherwise stars remains unchanged, row is the input string corresponding to the last iteration of the loop, min_x is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in stars, max_x is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in stars, min_y is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in stars, max_y is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in stars, and side is the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the points in stars**.
