Postcondition: ***`row` must have at least one character, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in the string `row`. If the second character is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`. Otherwise, `stars` remains `[ (0, '*') ]`. The values of `row` and `c` may remain unchanged depending on the second character being '*' or not.***
