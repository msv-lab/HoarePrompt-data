The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple containing the value of `j` and the value of `_` (which is the same as `c`) to the list `stars`. Given the initial conditions:

- `row` is the new input string,
- `j` is 0,
- `c` is the first character in `row`, and its current value is '*'.

Since `c` is '*', the value of `_` is also '*'. The tuple `(j, _)` becomes `(0, '*')`, which is appended to the list `stars`.

Therefore, the output state is: `row` is the new input string, `j` is 0, `c` is the first character in `row` (which is '*'), and `stars` is a list containing the tuple `(0, '*')`.

Output State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is 0, `c` is '*', and `stars` is [(0, '*')]**
