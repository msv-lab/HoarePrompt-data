The given code snippet starts by taking two integers `n` and `m` as input, splitting them by whitespace, and assigning them to variables `n` and `m`. Then, it initializes an empty list named `stars`. However, the code does not complete the process of populating the `stars` list with the star map. Since the problem statement mentions that the star map will be provided but the actual assignment of the star map is not done in the given snippet, we can assume the `stars` list remains empty.

Given the initial state where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), and the `stars` list is initialized but not populated, the final state after running the given code snippet would be:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, stars is an empty list**
