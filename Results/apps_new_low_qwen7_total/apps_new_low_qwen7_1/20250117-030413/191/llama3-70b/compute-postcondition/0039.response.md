Output State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is `n`, `c` is the last character in `row`, and `stars` is a list of tuples containing all indices `j` and characters `c` from `row` where `c` is '*'.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string using `enumerate(row)`.
   - For each character `c` at index `j`, it checks if `c` is '*'.
   - If `c` is '*', it appends a tuple `(j, c)` to the `stars` list.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: 
     - `row` remains the same as the input string throughout the loop.
     - `n` remains the length of `row` minus one.
   - **Variables that Change**:
     - `j`: This variable is updated to the current index during each iteration.
     - `c`: This variable is updated to the current character at the current index during each iteration.
     - `stars`: This list is updated based on whether `c` is '*'.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate once for each character in the `row` string.
   - After all iterations, `j` will be equal to the length of `row` minus one (`n`), and `c` will be the last character in `row`.
   - The `stars` list will contain all tuples `(j, c)` where `c` is '*', for every '*' found in the `row` string.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final value of `j` is `n`, the last index of `row`.
   - The final value of `c` is the last character of `row`.
   - The `stars` list contains all the positions and characters of '*' in the `row` string.
   - This matches the provided output states after each iteration, confirming the behavior of the loop.

Thus, after all executions of the loop have finished, the final state will be as described above.
