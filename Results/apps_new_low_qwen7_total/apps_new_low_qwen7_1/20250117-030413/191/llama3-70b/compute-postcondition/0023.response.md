Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `row` must have at least one character.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `c` is the second character in the string `row`.
   - If the second character is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`. Otherwise, `stars` remains `[ (0, '*') ]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for (j, c) in enumerate(row):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `row` along with its index.
   - Initially, `j` is set to 1, meaning the loop starts from the second character of `row`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 for each iteration.
   - `c` will be the next character in `row`.
   - `stars` will depend on whether `c` is '*' or not.

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - If `c` is '*', then `stars` becomes `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.
   - If `c` is not '*', then `stars` remains `[ (0, '*') ]`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1.
- `c` is the second character in `row`.
- If `c` is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.
- Otherwise, `stars` remains `[ (0, '*') ]`.

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- `c` will now be the third character in `row`.
- `stars` will depend on whether the new `c` is '*' or not.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `row` must have at least one character (remains unchanged).
- `j` will be 2.
- `c` will be the third character in `row`.
- If the third character is '*', then `stars` will be `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*'), (2, '*') ]`. Otherwise, `stars` will remain `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.

Final Answer:
State: **`row` must have at least one character, `j` is 2, `c` is the third character in the string `row`, if the third character is '*', then `stars` is `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*'), (2, '*') ]`. Otherwise, `stars` remains `[ (0, '*'), (1, '*') ]`.**
