The code snippet `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Here, `j` is the variable with the value `2`, and `_` (an underscore) is a wildcard that typically represents a value that is not used further in the code. Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `stars`, which now contains the tuple `(2, _)`.

Output State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is 2, `c` is the third character in `row`, `stars` is a list containing the tuple `(2, _)`**
