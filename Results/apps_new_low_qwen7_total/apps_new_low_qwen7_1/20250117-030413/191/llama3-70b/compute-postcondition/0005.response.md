`stars` is an empty list before the code execution. The code appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the `stars` list. Since `j` and `_` are not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet, we can assume they are variables that need to be assigned values prior to this line of code. However, without specific values for `j` and `_`, we can only say that a tuple containing `j` and `_` is appended to `stars`.

The output state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list containing one tuple `(j, _)`, `row` is an input string that must have at least one character.**
