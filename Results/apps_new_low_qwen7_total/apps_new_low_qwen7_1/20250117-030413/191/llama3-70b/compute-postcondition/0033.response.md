Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `row` is the new input string
- `j` is 0
- `c` is '*'
- `stars` is a list containing the tuple `(0, '*')`

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for (j, c) in enumerate(row):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This means:
- `j` is the index of the current character in `row`.
- `c` is the current character in `row`.

### Conditions for Continuing the Loop
The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `row` to process. Since `c` is not checked directly in the loop condition, we focus on `j` and `row`.

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 0
- `c` is '*'
- `stars` contains `(0, '*')`

### Next Iteration Considerations
For the loop to continue, `j` needs to increment to the next index, and `c` should be updated to the next character in `row`. The value of `c` is checked against '*', and if it is not '*', the loop stops. Otherwise, `stars` remains a list containing the tuple `(0, '*')`.

### Adjusting the State
Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. `c` will now be the second character in `row` (if the string has at least two characters).

If `c` is '*', then the loop continues, and `stars` remains the same. If `c` is not '*', the loop stops, and `stars` becomes an empty list.

### Updated State
- `row` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `j` is incremented to 1.
- `c` is the second character in `row` (if the string has at least two characters).
- `stars` remains `(0, '*')` if `c` is '*', otherwise it becomes an empty list.

### Final Answer
State: **`row` is the new input string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in `row` (if the string has at least two characters), `stars` is a list containing the tuple `(0, '*')` if `c` is '*', otherwise `stars` is an empty list**.
