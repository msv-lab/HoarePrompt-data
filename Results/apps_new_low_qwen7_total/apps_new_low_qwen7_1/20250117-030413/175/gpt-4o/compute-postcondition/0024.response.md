`result` is an empty list and `i` is 4. The code appends the value `'->' + str(a[i])` to `result`. Since `a[i]` is `a[4]` and `a` is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`, `a[4]` is `1`. Therefore, `'->' + str(a[4])` becomes `'->1'`. The `result` list is updated with this new element.

After executing the code, the `result` list contains `'->1'`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 4, `result` is ['->1']**
