The code appends the string concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'` to the `result` list. Given the initial state, `result` is a list with two additional elements which are string concatenations of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`, and `i` is an index into `a` such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`. After appending, the last element in the `result` list will be the string concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`.

Output State: **`result` is a list with three additional elements: the first two are string concatenations of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`, and the third is the concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`, `a` is a list, `i` is an index into `a` such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`.**
