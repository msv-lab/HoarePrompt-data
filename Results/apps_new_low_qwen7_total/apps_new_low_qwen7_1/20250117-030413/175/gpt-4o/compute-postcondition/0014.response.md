The code appends a string to the list `result`. Specifically, it appends `str(a[i]) + '->'` to `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `a[1]`, which is 1. Therefore, `str(a[i])` is `'1'`, and the appended string is `'1->'`.

Let's update the variables:
- `n` remains unchanged, so it is still 5.
- `a` remains unchanged, so it is still `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- `first_one_index` remains unchanged, so it is still 1.
- `first_zero_index` remains unchanged, so it is still greater than 1.
- `result` now includes the new string `'1->'` in addition to the existing elements `['0->', '(', '0->']`. So, `result` is now `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->']`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->'], `i` is 2**
