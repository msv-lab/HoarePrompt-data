The code `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` appends a string formed by converting `a[i]` to a string and appending '->' to it into the list `result`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is 5
- `a` is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
- `first_one_index` is 1
- `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1
- `result` is `['0->', '(']`

We need to determine the value of `i` used in the code snippet. Since no specific index is given, we assume the simplest case where `i` is the first index of `a`, which is 0. Let's proceed with this assumption.

- The value of `a[0]` is 0.
- Therefore, `str(a[0])` is '0'.
- The string `'0->'` is appended to `result`.

After the operation, the updated `result` is `['0->', '(', '0->']`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->']**
