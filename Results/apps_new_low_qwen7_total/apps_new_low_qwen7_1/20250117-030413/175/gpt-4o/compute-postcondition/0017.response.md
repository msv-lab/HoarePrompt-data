Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the indices defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. The loop body appends strings to the `result` list based on the values of `a[i]`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: 
  - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
  - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
  - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are used to define the range but are not modified within the loop itself.
- **Variables Modified in the Loop**:
  - `result`: Strings are appended to this list.
  - `i`: This variable is incremented within the loop and is used to iterate through the specified range.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will append strings to `result` starting from `first_one_index` up to `first_zero_index - 1`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.

### Verify Relationships
From the provided states, we can see:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->']`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->']`, and `i` is 2.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`, and `i` is 4.

Since `first_zero_index` must be greater than `first_one_index` (which is 1), and the loop appends one element per iteration, we can infer that the loop will continue appending elements until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.

### Determine the Final Output State
To find the final state after all iterations, we need to consider the maximum possible value of `first_zero_index` and the maximum number of times the loop can execute.

- If `first_zero_index` is 5, the loop would execute 3 times (from index 1 to 3).
- The final state of `result` would be: `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.

Since `first_zero_index` is not specified to be more than 5, and given the pattern, we assume `first_zero_index` is 5 (the highest possible value).

Thus, the final state of `result` will be `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.

### Conclusion
Output State: `n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->'].
