The given code snippet `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` appends a string to the list `result`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `result`, `a`, or `i`. Without these specific values, we can only describe the impact on the variables involved.

- `result` is a list that gets modified.
- `a` is a list that is being accessed via index `i`.
- `i` is an index into the list `a`.

The code creates a new string by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` with `'->'` and appends this string to `result`.

Since the initial state does not provide concrete values, we cannot specify exact values for `result`, `a`, or `i`. However, we can say that `i` is used as an index in `a`, and the string concatenation operation occurs.

Output State: **`result` is a list with one additional element which is the string concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`; `a` is a list; `i` is an index into `a`.**
