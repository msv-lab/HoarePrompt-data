The code appends a new element to the `result` list, which is formed by converting `a[i]` to a string and appending `']->'`. Given the initial state, we know `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`, which is 1. Therefore, the new element appended to `result` is `'1->'`.

Let's update the variables:
- `n` remains unchanged, so it is still 5.
- `a` remains unchanged, so it is still `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- `first_one_index` remains unchanged, so it is still 1.
- `first_zero_index` remains unchanged, so it is still greater than 1.
- `result` now includes the new element `'1->'`, so `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (since it is used as an index), so `i` becomes 4.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->'], `i` is 4**
