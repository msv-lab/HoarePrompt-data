Postcondition: ***`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. If 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is greater than 0, then `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'], and the string '101(1)->1->0->1' is printed. Otherwise, 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is not greater than 0.***
