Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables:**
   - The loop is defined as: `for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):`
   - The loop variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(first_one_index, first_zero_index)` is valid.
   - This means `first_one_index` should be less than `first_zero_index`.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - Given values:
     - `n = 5`
     - `a = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
     - `first_one_index = 1`
     - `first_zero_index = 1`
     - `result = ['0->', '(']`

4. **Check the Condition for the Loop:**
   - The condition `first_one_index < first_zero_index` must be true for the loop to execute.
   - However, currently, `first_one_index` is equal to `first_zero_index`, which means the condition is not met.

5. **Adjust the Initial Values:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the initial values such that `first_one_index < first_zero_index`.
   - For the loop to execute, `first_one_index` should be less than `first_zero_index`.

6. **Determine the State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - We need to ensure that `first_one_index` is less than `first_zero_index` for the loop to execute.
   - Since the initial values are both set to 1, we need to change one of them.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to set `first_zero_index` to a value greater than `first_one_index`.

State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(']**
