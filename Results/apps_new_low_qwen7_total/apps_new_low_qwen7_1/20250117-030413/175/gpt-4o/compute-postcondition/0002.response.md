The initial state is:
- `n` is 5
- `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

The code block performs the following actions:

1. Prints 'YES'.
2. Initializes an empty list `result`.
3. Finds the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a` and assigns it to `first_one_index`.
4. Finds the index of the first `0` in the sublist `a[first_one_index:]` and adds `first_one_index` to it to get `first_zero_index`.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The print statement does not modify any variables but outputs 'YES' to the console.
2. `result` is initialized as an empty list, which does not affect the given variables.
3. `first_one_index` is calculated as the index of the first `1` in `a`. Since the first `1` is at index `1`, `first_one_index` becomes `1`.
4. To find `first_zero_index`, we need to look at the sublist `a[first_one_index:]`, which is `[1, 0, 1, 1]`. The first `0` in this sublist is at index `0`, so adding `first_one_index` (which is `1`) gives us `1`. Thus, `first_zero_index` becomes `1`.

The final state after running the code block is:
- `n` is still 5
- `a` is still [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
- `first_one_index` is 1
- `first_zero_index` is 1
- `result` is an empty list []

Output State: **n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 1, result is []**
