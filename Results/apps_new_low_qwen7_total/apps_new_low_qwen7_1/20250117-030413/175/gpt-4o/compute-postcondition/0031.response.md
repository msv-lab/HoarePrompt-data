Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and returns a string based on certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist before the first 0 contains at least one 1. If both conditions are met, it constructs a specific string and prints it. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

- **Initial State:** The function starts with the list `a` of integers and the length `n` of the list.
- **Condition Check:** It first checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` contains at least one 1.
- **String Construction:**
  - If the condition is met, it constructs a string `result` by:
    - Appending `'0->'` followed by a parenthesis `'('`.
    - Iterating from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index - 1`, appending each element and `'->'`.
    - Appending the element at `first_zero_index`.
    - Closing the parenthesis `')'`.
    - Appending the remaining elements of the list separated by `'->'`.
  - If the condition is not met, it simply prints 'NO'.
- **Final State:** After executing the function, the program will either print the constructed string or 'NO'.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the list `a` does not contain any 0s, the function will print 'NO'.
- If the list `a` contains only zeros, the function will print 'NO'.
- If the list `a` contains only ones, the function will print 'NO'.
- If the list `a` contains exactly one zero at the beginning, the function will print 'NO'.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly. If returning the constructed string were required, additional code would be needed.
