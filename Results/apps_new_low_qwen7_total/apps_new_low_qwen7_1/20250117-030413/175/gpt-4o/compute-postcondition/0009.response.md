Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is 5
- `a` is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
- `first_one_index` is 1 (index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`)
- `first_zero_index` is 1 (index of the first occurrence of 0 in `a`)
- `result` is `[]`

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(first_one_index):
    result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = first_one_index - 1`. Given `first_one_index` is 1, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = 0`, i.e., it will execute exactly once.
2. **Variables Inside the Loop**:
   - `a`: The list remains unchanged inside the loop as it is not modified.
   - `i`: The loop variable starts at 0 and increments up to `first_one_index - 1`, which is 0 in this case.
   - `result`: A new element is appended to `result` each time the loop iterates. 

### Tracking Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `a` remains `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
  - `first_one_index` remains 1.
  - `first_zero_index` remains 1.
- **Variable `result`**: 
  - Initially, `result` is `[]`.
  - After the loop executes, `result` will contain one element, which is `str(a[0]) + '->'`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior
- The loop will append `str(a[0]) + '->'` to `result` once because `i` goes from 0 to 0 (inclusive) in the range defined by `first_one_index`.

### Verifying Relationships
- The loop appends `str(a[0]) + '->'` to `result` exactly once, resulting in `result` being `['0->']`.
- All other variables (`a`, `first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State
- After the loop completes, the final state of the variables is:
  - `n` is 5
  - `a` is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
  - `first_one_index` is 1
  - `first_zero_index` is 1
  - `result` is `['0->']`

Output State: **n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 1, result is ['0->'].**
