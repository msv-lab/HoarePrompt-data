The code appends a string to the `result` list. However, the initial state does not mention `result`. Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before the code execution. After executing `result.append('->' + str(a[i]))`, `result` will contain the appended string.

- `i` is 5, so `a[i]` refers to `a[5]`. But `a` only has indices from 0 to 4, so this access is out of bounds. In a typical Python environment, this would raise an `IndexError`.
- Since `a` only has 5 elements, `a[5]` is undefined. Assuming this is a simulation and we proceed hypothetically, let's consider what happens if we handle this as undefined or an error.

Given the hypothetical handling, since `a` does not have an index 5, no element is appended, and an error would occur. However, based on the provided format, we assume the hypothetical continuation where no element is appended.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 5, `result` is an empty list**
