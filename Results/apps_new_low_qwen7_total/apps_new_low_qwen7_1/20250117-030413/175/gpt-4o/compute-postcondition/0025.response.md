Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range defined by `first_zero_index + 1` to `n`. For each iteration, it appends `->` followed by the value of `a[i]` to the `result` list.

### Initial State
- `n` = 5
- `a` = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
- `first_one_index` = 1
- `first_zero_index` = 5
- `result` = ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')']

### Track Variable Changes
- `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain constant throughout the loop.
- `i` is updated within the loop but does not affect the final output directly.
- `result` changes by appending new elements based on the current value of `a[i]`.

### Summary of the Loop Behavior
The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `first_zero_index + 1` to `n - 1`. The loop stops when `i` reaches `n`.

### Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs:
- After 1 execution: `i` = 2, `result` = ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1']
- After 2 executions: `i` = 3, `result` = ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0']
- After 3 executions: `i` = 4, `result` = ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1']

This shows that the loop correctly appends `'->' + str(a[i])` to the `result` list until `i` equals `n - 1`.

### Determine Final Output State
Since the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will stop when `i` becomes equal to `n - 1` (i.e., `i` = 4). Therefore, the final state of `i` will be 4.

After the loop completes, `result` will contain all the appended strings from the loop:
```python
result = ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1']
```

### Output State
Output State: **n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 5, result is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'].**
