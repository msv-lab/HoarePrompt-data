The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list `a` is either 0 or 1. The length of the list `a` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000.

Case_1: The function returns the count of 1s in the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of integers (each being 0 or 1) and return the count of 1s in the list.
