Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `first_zero_index`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `first_zero_index + 1` to `n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is 5
   - `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
   - `first_one_index` is 1
   - `first_zero_index` is 3
   - `result` is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1']

4. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from `first_zero_index + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `first_zero_index + 1`.
   - Given `first_zero_index` is 3, the initial value of `i` would be `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - `first_zero_index` remains the same at 3.
   - `n` remains the same at 5.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `n` is still 5.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `first_one_index` remains unchanged.
   - `first_zero_index` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 5**
