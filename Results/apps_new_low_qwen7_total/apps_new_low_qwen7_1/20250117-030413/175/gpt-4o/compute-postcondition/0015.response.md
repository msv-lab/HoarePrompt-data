Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `first_one_index`, and `first_zero_index`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `first_one_index` is 1, and `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `first_one_index` remains the same at 1.
   - `first_zero_index` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes 3.
- `first_zero_index` must still be greater than 1.

The final state before the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->'], `i` is 3**
