Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(first_zero_index + 1, n)`.
   
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
   - `first_one_index` is 1
   - `first_zero_index` is 3
   - `i` is 5
   - `result` is an empty list

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n)` will execute if `first_zero_index + 1 <= i < n`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.
   - The condition for the next iteration would be `first_zero_index + 1 <= i < n`. Given `first_zero_index` is 3 and `n` is 5, the next value of `i` should be 4 (since `i` was 5 in the previous iteration).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 4 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains 5 as it is a constant and does not change within the loop.
   - The other variables (`a`, `first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`, and `result`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 4, `result` is an empty list**
