The initial state is defined as follows: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.

The provided code snippet performs the following actions:
1. Reads an integer from input and assigns it to `n`.
2. Reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

Since no specific values for `n` and the integers in `a` are given in this context, we'll denote the final state based on the general behavior of the code.

Let's assume the user inputs a value for `n` (e.g., 5) and a list of integers (e.g., "0 1 0 1 1"). This would result in the following state after running the code:
- `n` is set to the integer value input by the user.
- `a` is set to the list of integers provided by the user.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the user inputs `n = 5` and the list `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.

The final state would be:
Output State: **n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]**
