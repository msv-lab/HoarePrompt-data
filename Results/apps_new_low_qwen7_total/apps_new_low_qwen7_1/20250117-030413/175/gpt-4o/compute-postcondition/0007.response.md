Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `result` is a list with three additional elements:
    - The first two elements are string concatenations of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`.
    - The third element is the concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`, `a[i]`.
  - `a` is a list.
  - `i` is an index into `a` such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(first_one_index):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- **Loop Head Variables:**
  - `i`: The loop variable.
  - `first_one_index`: A threshold value that defines the upper limit for `i`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State:**
   - `result` contains three elements:
     - `result[0] = str(a[i]) + '->'`
     - `result[1] = str(a[i]) + '->'`
     - `result[2] = str(a[i]) + '->' + str(a[i])`
   - `a` is a list.
   - `i` is an index such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i`, `i` should still satisfy the condition `i + 1 < first_one_index`.

3. **Modifying the States:**
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was previously such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`, the new `i` (which is `i + 1`) should still satisfy this condition.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `first_one_index` remains unchanged because it is a threshold value and does not change within the loop.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `first_one_index` remains the same.
- `result` remains unchanged as no new elements are added or removed; it simply contains the updated `i` value if accessed.

### Answer:
State: **`result` is a list with three additional elements: the first two are string concatenations of `str(a[i+1])` and `'->'`, and the third is the concatenation of `str(a[i+1])` and `'->'`, `a[i+1]`, `a` is a list, `i` is an index into `a` such that `i + 2 < first_one_index`**.
