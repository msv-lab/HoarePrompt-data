Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables mentioned in the for loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i` in the range from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 5 (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `first_one_index` is 1 (initial value for the loop)
   - `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1 (loop must continue as long as `first_zero_index > first_one_index`)
   - `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->'] (not directly involved in the loop)

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will start from `first_one_index` (which is 1) and go up to `first_zero_index - 1`.
   - Since `first_one_index` is 1, the loop will execute for `i = 1` initially.
   - For the loop to continue, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be 1, and the loop will check if `i + 1` (which is 2) is still within the range defined by `first_zero_index`.

5. **Next State**:
   - `i` will be set to 1 (the next value in the range).
   - `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` must be greater than 1, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->'], `i` is 1**
