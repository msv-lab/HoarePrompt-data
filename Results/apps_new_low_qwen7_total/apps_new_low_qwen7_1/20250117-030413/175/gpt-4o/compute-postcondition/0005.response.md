Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `result` is a list with one additional element which is the string concatenation of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`.
- `a` is a list.
- `i` is an index into `a`.

### Loop Condition
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(first_one_index):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `first_one_index - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented.
   
2. **List `a`:**
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged during the loop execution since no modification to `a` is mentioned.

3. **List `result`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `result` has one additional element.
   - This means that the loop has executed at least once, and it added one element to `result`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Since `i` is iterating over `range(first_one_index)`, the loop will continue if `i < first_one_index`.

### Adjusted States
- `result` will have another element added to it, making it a list with two additional elements.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given the above analysis, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

### Final Answer
State: **`result` is a list with two additional elements which are the string concatenations of `str(a[i])` and `'->'`, `a` is a list, `i` is an index into `a` such that `i + 1 < first_one_index`**.
