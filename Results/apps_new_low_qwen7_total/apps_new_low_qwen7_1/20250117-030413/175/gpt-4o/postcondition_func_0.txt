The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and returns a string based on certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist before the first 0 contains at least one 1. If both conditions are met, it constructs a specific string and prints it. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
