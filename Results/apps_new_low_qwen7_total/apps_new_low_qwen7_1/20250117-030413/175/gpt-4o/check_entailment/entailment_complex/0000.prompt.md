Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0) :
        print('YES')

result = []

first_one_index = a.index(1)

first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 1, result is ['0->'].
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.
        #
        #### Analyze the Code and Initial State
        #The loop iterates over the indices defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. The loop body appends strings to the `result` list based on the values of `a[i]`.
        #
        #### Track Variable Changes
        #- **Invariants**: 
        #  - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
        #  - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
        #  - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are used to define the range but are not modified within the loop itself.
        #- **Variables Modified in the Loop**:
        #  - `result`: Strings are appended to this list.
        #  - `i`: This variable is incremented within the loop and is used to iterate through the specified range.
        #
        #### Summarize the Loop Behavior
        #The loop will append strings to `result` starting from `first_one_index` up to `first_zero_index - 1`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #
        #### Verify Relationships
        #From the provided states, we can see:
        #- After the loop executes 1 time, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->']`.
        #- After the loop executes 2 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->']`, and `i` is 2.
        #- After the loop executes 3 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`, and `i` is 4.
        #
        #Since `first_zero_index` must be greater than `first_one_index` (which is 1), and the loop appends one element per iteration, we can infer that the loop will continue appending elements until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #
        #### Determine the Final Output State
        #To find the final state after all iterations, we need to consider the maximum possible value of `first_zero_index` and the maximum number of times the loop can execute.
        #
        #- If `first_zero_index` is 5, the loop would execute 3 times (from index 1 to 3).
        #- The final state of `result` would be: `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
        #
        #Since `first_zero_index` is not specified to be more than 5, and given the pattern, we assume `first_zero_index` is 5 (the highest possible value).
        #
        #Thus, the final state of `result` will be `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
        #
        #### Conclusion
        #Output State: `n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->'].
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))

result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 5, result is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'].
        print(''.join(result))
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. If 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is greater than 0, then `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'], and the string '101(1)->1->0->1' is printed. Otherwise, 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is not greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and returns a string based on certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist before the first 0 contains at least one 1. If both conditions are met, it constructs a specific string and prints it. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
