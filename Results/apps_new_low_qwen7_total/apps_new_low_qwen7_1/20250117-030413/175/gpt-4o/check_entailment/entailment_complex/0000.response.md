### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to place brackets in the logical expression \(a_1 \rightarrow a_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a_n\) so that its value is false.
   - The expression is false if and only if \(a_i = 1\) and \(a_{i+1} = 0\) for some \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies if there exists an index `i` where \(a_i = 1\) and \(a_{i+1} = 0\).
   - If such an index exists, the program constructs a valid bracketed expression to ensure the overall implication evaluates to false.
   - The construction logic:
     - It finds the first occurrence of `1` (`first_one_index`).
     - Then it finds the first `0` after the first `1` (`first_zero_index`).
     - It constructs the expression by ensuring that the sub-expression between the first `1` and the first `0` evaluates to true, making the entire expression false.
     - The construction ensures the implication chain correctly reflects the given values.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initial Checks:**
     - The program checks if `0` is in `a` and if the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` contains at least one `1`.
   - **Construction Logic:**
     - If the above condition is met, it constructs the expression:
       - Appends the part from the start to `first_one_index` with implications.
       - Encloses the segment from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index` in parentheses to ensure the segment evaluates to true.
       - Appends the rest of the expression from `first_zero_index` to the end.
   - **Handling Cases:**
     - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles all cases where placing brackets can make the expression evaluate to false.
   - The constructed expression is syntactically correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to place brackets so that the implication expression evaluates to false. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
