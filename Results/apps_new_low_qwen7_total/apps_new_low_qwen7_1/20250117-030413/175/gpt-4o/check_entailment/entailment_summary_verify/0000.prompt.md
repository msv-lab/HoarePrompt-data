You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0 1 1 0

Output
YES
(((0)->1)->(1->0))

Input
2
1 1

Output
NO

Input
1
0

Output
YES
0

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:
        print('YES')
        result = []
        first_one_index = a.index(1)
        first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))
        result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
        print(''.join(result))
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and returns a string based on certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist before the first 0 contains at least one 1. If both conditions are met, it constructs a specific string and prints it. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has issues with handling certain cases, particularly when there are consecutive zeros in the input. Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input
```
Input:
3
0 0 0
```

### Expected Output
The logical expression `0 -> 0 -> 0` should evaluate to `1`, because the first argument is `0`. However, placing brackets in any way will not make this expression evaluate to `0`. Therefore, the output should be `NO`.

### Actual Output from the Program
The program will attempt to place brackets but will not handle the case correctly. Here’s how the program behaves:

1. It checks if there is a `0` and if there is a `1` before the first `0`.
2. In this case, there are three `0`s, and the first `0` does not have a `1` before it.
3. The program will incorrectly conclude that it is possible to place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0`.

### Program Analysis
The key issue is in the condition:
```python
if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:
```
This condition is checking if there is a `0` and if there is a `1` before the first `0`. This logic fails to handle cases where there are no `1`s before the first `0`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if there is a `0`, and it is not the last element, and there is at least one `0` after it, then it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`.

### Corrected Logic
A corrected version of the logic would be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if it's possible to make the expression evaluate to 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] == 0 and a[i + 1] == 1:
            print('NO')
            return
    
    # If no such pair found, it's impossible to make the expression evaluate to 0
    print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected logic ensures that if there is a `0` followed by a `1`, it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`, thus returning `NO` correctly.

Since the original program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
