### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect. The assessment is accurate, but the solution provided for fixing the program is not entirely correct. Let's re-evaluate the program and the logic needed to solve the problem.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Understanding Implication**: The implication function works as follows:
   - \(0 \rightarrow 0 = 1\)
   - \(0 \rightarrow 1 = 1\)
   - \(1 \rightarrow 0 = 0\)
   - \(1 \rightarrow 1 = 1\)

2. **Expression Evaluation**: To make the entire expression evaluate to `0`, we need to find a way to place parentheses such that the overall expression evaluates to `0`. If there is a `1` immediately following a `0`, it is impossible to make the entire expression evaluate to `0` because the `1` will always result in a `1` due to the implication rules.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The original program checks if there is a `0` and if there is a `1` before the first `0`. This is incorrect because it doesn't handle cases where there is no `1` before the first `0`.
   - The corrected logic suggested checks if there is a `0` followed by a `1` and prints `NO`. However, this logic is incomplete because it doesn't cover all cases.

#### Corrected Solution:
To properly determine if it is possible to place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0`, we need to check for the presence of a `0` followed by a `1` anywhere in the sequence. If such a pair exists, it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`. Otherwise, it is possible to make the expression evaluate to `0` by appropriately placing brackets.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if there is a 0 followed by a 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] == 0 and a[i + 1] == 1:
            print('NO')
            return

    # If no such pair found, it's possible to make the expression evaluate to 0
    print('YES')
    # Construct the expression
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(str(a[i]))
        if i < n - 1:
            result.append('->')
    print(''.join(result))

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Checking for `0` followed by `1`**:
   - We iterate through the list `a` and check if there is a `0` followed by a `1`. If such a pair is found, we print `NO` and return.
   
2. **Constructing the Expression**:
   - If no `0` followed by `1` is found, we construct the expression by simply joining the elements with `->` and print it.

This approach ensures that the program handles all cases correctly and prints the appropriate output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** if the given program is correct or **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate, and the program needs to be fixed as shown above. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
