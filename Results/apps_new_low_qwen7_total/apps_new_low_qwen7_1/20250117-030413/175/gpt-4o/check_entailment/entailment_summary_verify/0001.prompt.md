You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0 1 1 0

Output
YES
(((0)->1)->(1->0))

Input
2
1 1

Output
NO

Input
1
0

Output
YES
0

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:
        print('YES')
        result = []
        first_one_index = a.index(1)
        first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
        for i in range(first_one_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append('(')
        for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):
            result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))
        result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
        print(''.join(result))
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and returns a string based on certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the list `a` contains a 0 and if the sublist before the first 0 contains at least one 1. If both conditions are met, it constructs a specific string and prints it. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of arguments `n` and the list of values `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:` checks if there is at least one `0` in the list and if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`. This is a crucial part because it identifies whether placing brackets can make the entire expression evaluate to `0`.

3. **Constructing the Expression:**
   - If the condition is met, the program constructs the required expression. It does this by iterating through the list and forming the implication chain appropriately.
   - The program correctly handles the placement of brackets around the segment `[first_one_index, first_zero_index]` to ensure the overall implication evaluates to `0`.
   - After constructing the bracketed segment, it appends the remaining parts of the list to the result.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed expression.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Case 1:** `0 1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(((0)->1)->(1->0))`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 2:** `1 1`
  - There is no `0` in the list, so the condition is not met.
  - The output should be `NO`, which is handled correctly.

- **Case 3:** `0`
  - The single `0` means the expression is already `0` without needing any brackets.
  - The output should be `YES` followed by `0`, which is handled correctly.

Given that the program handles all cases correctly according to the problem statement, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
