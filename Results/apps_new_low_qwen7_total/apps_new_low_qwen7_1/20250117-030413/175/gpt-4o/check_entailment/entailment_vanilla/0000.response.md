### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of arguments `n` and the list of values `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:` checks if there is at least one `0` in the list and if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`. This is a crucial part because it identifies whether placing brackets can make the entire expression evaluate to `0`.

3. **Constructing the Expression:**
   - If the condition is met, the program constructs the required expression. It does this by iterating through the list and forming the implication chain appropriately.
   - The program correctly handles the placement of brackets around the segment `[first_one_index, first_zero_index]` to ensure the overall implication evaluates to `0`.
   - After constructing the bracketed segment, it appends the remaining parts of the list to the result.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed expression.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Case 1:** `0 1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(((0)->1)->(1->0))`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 2:** `1 1`
  - There is no `0` in the list, so the condition is not met.
  - The output should be `NO`, which is handled correctly.

- **Case 3:** `0`
  - The single `0` means the expression is already `0` without needing any brackets.
  - The output should be `YES` followed by `0`, which is handled correctly.

Given that the program handles all cases correctly according to the problem statement, the solution is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
