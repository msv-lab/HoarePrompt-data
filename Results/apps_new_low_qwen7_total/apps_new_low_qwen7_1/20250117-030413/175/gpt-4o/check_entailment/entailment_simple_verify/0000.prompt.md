You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.
        #
        #### Analyze the Code and Initial State
        #The loop iterates over the indices defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. The loop body appends strings to the `result` list based on the values of `a[i]`.
        #
        #### Track Variable Changes
        #- **Invariants**: 
        #  - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
        #  - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
        #  - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are used to define the range but are not modified within the loop itself.
        #- **Variables Modified in the Loop**:
        #  - `result`: Strings are appended to this list.
        #  - `i`: This variable is incremented within the loop and is used to iterate through the specified range.
        #
        #### Summarize the Loop Behavior
        #The loop will append strings to `result` starting from `first_one_index` up to `first_zero_index - 1`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #
        #### Verify Relationships
        #From the provided states, we can see:
        #- After the loop executes 1 time, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->']`.
        #- After the loop executes 2 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->']`, and `i` is 2.
        #- After the loop executes 3 times, `result` becomes `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`, and `i` is 4.
        #
        #Since `first_zero_index` must be greater than `first_one_index` (which is 1), and the loop appends one element per iteration, we can infer that the loop will continue appending elements until `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #
        #### Determine the Final Output State
        #To find the final state after all iterations, we need to consider the maximum possible value of `first_zero_index` and the maximum number of times the loop can execute.
        #
        #- If `first_zero_index` is 5, the loop would execute 3 times (from index 1 to 3).
        #- The final state of `result` would be: `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
        #
        #Since `first_zero_index` is not specified to be more than 5, and given the pattern, we assume `first_zero_index` is 5 (the highest possible value).
        #
        #Thus, the final state of `result` will be `['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
        #
        #### Conclusion
        #Output State: `n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['0->', '(', '0->', '1->', '1->'].
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))

result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 5, a is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], first_one_index is 1, first_zero_index is 5, result is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'].
        print(''.join(result))
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 5, `a` is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. If 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is greater than 0, then `first_one_index` is 1, `first_zero_index` is 5, `result` is ['1', '0', '1', '(', '1', ')', '->1', '->0', '->1'], and the string '101(1)->1->0->1' is printed. Otherwise, 0 is in the list `a` and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is not greater than 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has issues with handling certain cases, particularly when there are consecutive zeros in the input. Let's consider the following example:

### Example Input
```
Input:
3
0 0 0
```

### Expected Output
The logical expression `0 -> 0 -> 0` should evaluate to `1`, because the first argument is `0`. However, placing brackets in any way will not make this expression evaluate to `0`. Therefore, the output should be `NO`.

### Actual Output from the Program
The program will attempt to place brackets but will not handle the case correctly. Here’s how the program behaves:

1. It checks if there is a `0` and if there is a `1` before the first `0`.
2. In this case, there are three `0`s, and the first `0` does not have a `1` before it.
3. The program will incorrectly conclude that it is possible to place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0`.

### Program Analysis
The key issue is in the condition:
```python
if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:
```
This condition is checking if there is a `0` and if there is a `1` before the first `0`. This logic fails to handle cases where there are no `1`s before the first `0`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if there is a `0`, and it is not the last element, and there is at least one `0` after it, then it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`.

### Corrected Logic
A corrected version of the logic would be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if it's possible to make the expression evaluate to 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] == 0 and a[i + 1] == 1:
            print('NO')
            return
    
    # If no such pair found, it's impossible to make the expression evaluate to 0
    print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected logic ensures that if there is a `0` followed by a `1`, it is impossible to make the expression evaluate to `0`, thus returning `NO` correctly.

Since the original program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
