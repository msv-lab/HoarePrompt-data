### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and use the annotated code to validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of arguments `n` and the list of values `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:` checks if there is at least one `0` in the list and if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`. This is a crucial part because it identifies whether placing brackets can make the entire expression evaluate to `0`.

3. **Constructing the Expression:**
   - If the condition is met, the program constructs the required expression. It does this by iterating through the list and forming the implication chain appropriately.
   - The program correctly handles the placement of brackets around the segment `[first_one_index, first_zero_index]` to ensure the overall implication evaluates to `0`.
   - After constructing the bracketed segment, it appends the remaining parts of the list to the result.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed expression.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

Now, let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided examples and the annotated code.

#### Example 1: `4 0 1 1 0`
- **Condition Check:**
  - `0` is present, and there is at least one `1` before the first `0`.
  - `first_one_index = 1`, `first_zero_index = 3`.
  - The expression should be `(((0)->1)->(1->0))`.

- **Program Execution:**
  - `result = ['0->', '(', '1->', '1->', ')']`.
  - `print(''.join(result))` outputs `0->(1->1->)` which is incorrect.

#### Example 2: `2 1 1`
- **Condition Check:**
  - No `0` is present.
  - The output should be `NO`.

- **Program Execution:**
  - `print('NO')` is correct.

#### Example 3: `1 0`
- **Condition Check:**
  - The single `0` means the expression is already `0` without needing any brackets.
  - The output should be `YES` followed by `0`.

- **Program Execution:**
  - The program prints `YES` and `0` which is correct.

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle the first example correctly. The provided solution fails to generate the correct bracketed expression for the case where `0` is followed by at least one `1` before the next `0`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but our analysis shows that the program does not generate the correct output for certain cases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
