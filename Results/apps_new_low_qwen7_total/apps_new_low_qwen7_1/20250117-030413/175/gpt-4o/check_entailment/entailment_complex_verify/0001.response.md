### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and verify its correctness using the annotated code and examples:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of arguments `n` and the list of values `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if 0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0:` checks if there is at least one `0` in the list and if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`. This is a crucial part because it identifies whether placing brackets can make the entire expression evaluate to `0`.

3. **Constructing the Expression:**
   - If the condition is met, the program constructs the required expression. It does this by iterating through the list and forming the implication chain appropriately.
     - The loop `for i in range(first_one_index):` appends `a[i] ->` to `result`, creating the segment before the first `0`.
     - `result.append('(')` adds an opening parenthesis.
     - The loop `for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index):` appends `a[i] ->` to `result`, creating the segment between the first `1` and the first `0`.
     - `result.append(')')` closes the parenthesis.
     - The loop `for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):` appends `-> a[i]` to `result`, creating the segment after the first `0`.
   - After constructing the bracketed segment, it appends the remaining parts of the list to the result.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed expression.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Case 1:** `0 1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(((0)->1)->(1->0))`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 2:** `1 1`
  - There is no `0` in the list, so the condition is not met.
  - The output should be `NO`, which is handled correctly.

- **Case 3:** `0`
  - The single `0` means the expression is already `0` without needing any brackets.
  - The output should be `YES` followed by `0`, which is handled correctly.

- **Case 4:** `1 0 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(1->0)->(1->0)`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 5:** `1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(1->1)->0`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 6:** `1 1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(1->(1->1))->0`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

- **Case 7:** `1 1 1 1 0`
  - The first `0` appears after at least one `1`, so the condition is met.
  - The output should be: `YES` followed by a valid expression, e.g., `(1->(1->(1->1)))->0`.
  - The provided solution constructs this expression correctly.

### Detailed Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is read from input.
  - `a` is a list of integers read from input.

- **Condition Check:**
  - `0 in a` checks if there is at least one `0` in `a`.
  - `a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0` checks if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`.

- **Bracket Construction:**
  - `result.append('(')` and `result.append(')')` are used to create the necessary bracketing around the segment between the first `1` and the first `0`.
  - The loops handle the construction of the implication chain correctly.

- **Output:**
  - If the condition is met, the constructed expression is printed.
  - If the condition is not met, "NO" is printed.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly identifies whether it is possible to place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0` and constructs the appropriate expression when possible. The solution handles all test cases correctly and follows the problem statement precisely.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
