The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000) do not apply since no parameters are defined.

Given the output cases, it implies that the function is intended to return a value based on some conditions related to the parameters x and y, but since these parameters are not passed to the function, the described functionality cannot be accurately stated without the actual implementation.

However, based on the output cases provided:

- Case_1: The function is expected to return an integer.
- Case_2: The function is expected to return an integer.

Assuming the intention was to describe the output based on the relationship between x and y, the corrected function signature should include the parameters x and y.

Therefore, the corrected and functional description would be:

The function `func(x, y)` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. If the conditions for the cases are met, the function returns an integer. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, returns an integer based on the specified conditions.**
