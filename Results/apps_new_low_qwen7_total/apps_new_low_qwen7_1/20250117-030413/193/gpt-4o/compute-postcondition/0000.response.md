The initial state is defined by the conditions: `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`.

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. It then prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `(x - y)` calculates the difference between `x` and `y`.
- `// 2` performs integer division by 2.
- `% 2` calculates the remainder when `(x - y)` is divided by 2.
- Adding these two results gives the floor division result plus the remainder, effectively rounding the division result to the nearest integer if it is not already an integer.

Since `x` and `y` are integers and the difference between them is always even or odd:
- If `(x - y)` is even, `(x - y) // 2` is the integer division and `(x - y) % 2` is 0, so the expression evaluates to the integer division result.
- If `(x - y)` is odd, `(x - y) // 2` is the integer division and `(x - y) % 2` is 1, so the expression evaluates to the integer division result plus 1.

Given the conditions `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`, the expression will always yield the integer part of the division rounded to the nearest integer. 

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can represent the final state in a general form based on the given conditions and the operation performed. However, we can say that `x` and `y` are updated to their input values, and the result of the expression is printed.

Output State: **x is the input integer, y is the input integer, the printed result is the rounded integer of (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
