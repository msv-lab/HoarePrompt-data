You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

- Program:
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts two space-separated integers `x` and `y` as input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. It calculates and returns an integer based on the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. This expression effectively rounds down the result of `(x - y) / 2` to the nearest integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input and performing the calculation. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; however, since `x` and `y` are constrained by `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, these constraints ensure that the division and modulo operations are well-defined. The function returns the calculated integer as the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the difference between `x` and `y`, and then determining the minimum number of operations required to reduce the side length from `x` to `y`. However, there's a flaw in the logic used in the program. 

The logic `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the operations performed maintain the triangle inequality (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to recognize that each operation reduces one side by at least 1, but we must also ensure that the triangle inequality is maintained throughout the process. The correct approach would be to reduce the largest side in each step until all sides match the target side length `y`.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Start with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
2. Reduce the side lengths to `y` by ensuring the triangle inequality holds true after each reduction.
3. Count the number of operations needed.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of operations needed
    print(x - y)

# Test the function with provided examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
