### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly identifies the logic of the given program as flawed without providing a detailed breakdown of why the current logic is incorrect. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to understand its behavior and determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

#### Annotations:
- State before the function call: \( x \) and \( y \) are integers such that \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \).
- The program splits the input into integers \( x \) and \( y \) and prints the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\).

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Expression Analysis:**
   - \((x - y) // 2\): This part calculates the integer division of the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) by 2. This essentially gives the number of times we can reduce a side by 2 without violating the triangle inequality.
   - \((x - y) \% 2\): This part calculates the remainder when \( x - y \) is divided by 2. This gives the additional operation needed if the difference is odd.

2. **Combining the Results:**
   - The expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) combines these two parts to give the total number of operations needed.

3. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - For \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \):
     - \( x - y = 6 - 3 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 // 2 = 1 \) (integer division)
     - \( 3 \% 2 = 1 \) (remainder)
     - Total operations: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) (but the correct answer is 4, as shown in the note)

4. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The given expression does not explicitly check the triangle inequality after each operation. It simply subtracts from \( x \) and adds 1 for the remainder, which might not always yield the minimum number of operations while maintaining the triangle inequality.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the operations maintain the triangle inequality. The correct approach involves reducing the largest side in each step until all sides match the target side length \( y \).

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not enforce the triangle inequality during each operation. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the logic is flawed, but the provided solution in the original assessment is incorrect as well because it simply subtracts the difference without checking the triangle inequality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly enforce the triangle inequality during the operations.
