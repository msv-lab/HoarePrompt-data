Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the problem requirements step-by-step.

1. **Problem Requirements**: The goal is to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \(x\) into one with side length \(y\) using the minimum number of seconds. In each second, we can change the length of a single side, ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides must be positive and form a valid triangle).

2. **Key Observation**: To minimize the number of changes, we need to make the side lengths as close to \(y\) as possible while still forming a valid triangle. The simplest way to achieve this is to reduce the side lengths from \(x\) to \(y\) in steps, always ensuring the triangle inequality is maintained.

3. **Algorithm Insight**: The formula used in the code, \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2\), aims to compute the minimum number of steps needed. Here's how it works:
   - \((x - y) // 2\) computes the number of full steps of 1 needed to reduce the side length from \(x\) to some point just above \(y\).
   - \((x - y) % 2\) checks if there's an extra step needed because the division might not perfectly align with the integer reduction steps.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first example, \(x = 6\) and \(y = 3\):
     - \((6 - 3) // 2 = 1\)
     - \((6 - 3) % 2 = 0\)
     - Total steps = \(1 + 0 = 1\)
     - However, the actual steps should be 4, as per the problem note.
   - For the second example, \(x = 8\) and \(y = 5\):
     - \((8 - 5) // 2 = 1\)
     - \((8 - 5) % 2 = 0\)
     - Total steps = \(1 + 0 = 1\)
     - The actual steps should be 3, as per the problem note.
   - For the third example, \(x = 22\) and \(y = 4\):
     - \((22 - 4) // 2 = 9\)
     - \((22 - 4) % 2 = 0\)
     - Total steps = \(9 + 0 = 9\)
     - The actual steps should be 6, as per the problem note.

Given these examples, the formula provided in the code does not accurately calculate the minimum number of steps required. The provided solution overestimates the number of steps in many cases.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
