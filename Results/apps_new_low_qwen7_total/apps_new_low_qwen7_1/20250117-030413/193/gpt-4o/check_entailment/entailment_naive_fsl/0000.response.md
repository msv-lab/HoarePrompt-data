Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. The logic in the program seems to be flawed because it simply calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which does not guarantee the minimum number of steps required to form an equilateral triangle at each step.

For instance, consider the input `22 4`. According to the examples provided in the problem statement, the correct sequence of transformations would be:
- Start with (22, 22, 22)
- Transform to (7, 22, 22)
- Transform to (7, 22, 16)
- Transform to (7, 10, 16)
- Transform to (7, 10, 4)
- Transform to (7, 4, 4)
- Finally, transform to (4, 4, 4)

This sequence requires 6 transformations, but the program incorrectly outputs `6 // 2 + 6 % 2 = 4`.

Another example, consider the input `8 5`. The correct sequence would be:
- Start with (8, 8, 8)
- Transform to (8, 8, 5)
- Transform to (8, 5, 5)
- Finally, transform to (5, 5, 5)

This sequence requires 3 transformations, but the program incorrectly outputs `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 3`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
