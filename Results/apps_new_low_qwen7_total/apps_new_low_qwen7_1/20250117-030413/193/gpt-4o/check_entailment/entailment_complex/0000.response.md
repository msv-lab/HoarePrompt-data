Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \(x\) into an equilateral triangle with side length \(y\), where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The approach used in the code is to compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{x - y}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( x - y \right) \% 2\).

Let's break down the expression:
- \((x - y) // 2\) represents the integer division of \((x - y)\) by 2, which gives the number of full operations needed to reduce the side length from \(x\) to a value less than \(y\) by 2 units each time.
- \((x - y) \% 2\) gives the remainder when \((x - y)\) is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, it means there is an extra unit left after performing full reductions of 2 units each time.

However, this formula is not correct for solving the problem. To achieve the transformation correctly, we need to ensure that at each step, the new side length still forms a valid triangle. Given that we start with an equilateral triangle and can only change one side per operation while maintaining the triangle inequality (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side), the key is to reduce the side length in such a way that the triangle remains valid.

A more accurate approach would involve reducing the side length in steps of 1, ensuring that the triangle inequality is always maintained. For example, if \(x = 10\) and \(y = 5\), the correct sequence of operations would be:
1. Reduce one side from 10 to 9.
2. Reduce another side from 10 to 8.
3. Reduce the remaining side from 10 to 7.
4. Reduce one side from 9 to 6.
5. Reduce another side from 9 to 5.
6. Reduce the remaining side from 9 to 4.
7. Reduce one side from 8 to 7.
8. Reduce another side from 8 to 6.
9. Reduce the remaining side from 8 to 5.
10. Reduce one side from 7 to 6.
11. Reduce another side from 7 to 5.
12. Reduce the remaining side from 7 to 4.
13. Reduce one side from 6 to 5.
14. Reduce another side from 6 to 4.
15. Reduce the remaining side from 6 to 5.
16. Reduce one side from 5 to 4.
17. Reduce another side from 5 to 3.
18. Reduce the remaining side from 5 to 4.
19. Reduce one side from 4 to 3.
20. Reduce another side from 4 to 2.
21. Reduce the remaining side from 4 to 3.

This process ensures that the triangle inequality is always maintained and the minimum number of steps is used. However, the provided solution does not follow this logic and simply uses a formula that does not guarantee the maintenance of the triangle inequality.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
