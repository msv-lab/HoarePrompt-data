Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())

print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two space-separated integers `x` and `y` as input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. It calculates and returns an integer based on the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. This expression effectively rounds down the result of `(x - y) / 2` to the nearest integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input and performing the calculation. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; however, since `x` and `y` are constrained by `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, these constraints ensure that the division and modulo operations are well-defined. The function returns the calculated integer as the output.
