Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

# Program:
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a boolean value. It first checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if true. Then, it checks if `x` is less than or equal to 3, returning `True` if true. Next, it verifies if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. After these initial checks, the function enters a loop that increments an integer `i` starting from 5 and checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`. If `x` is found to be divisible by any `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`. The final state of the program is that `x` remains unchanged, and the function returns `True` if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 1 or 2 by returning `False` immediately.
