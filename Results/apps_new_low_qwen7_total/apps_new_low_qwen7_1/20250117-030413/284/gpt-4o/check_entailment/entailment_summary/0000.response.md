Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find a counterexample \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given \( n \). Here's how the solution works:

1. The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
2. It iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
4. It uses the `func_1` function to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number.
5. If `func_1` returns `False` (indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime), it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly implements a primality test:
- It returns `False` for non-positive integers.
- It returns `True` for 2 and 3.
- It checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
- It uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form \( 6k \pm 1 \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \).

Given the problem constraints and the implementation of `func_1`, the program should correctly find and print an appropriate \( m \) that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) non-prime.

Based on this analysis, the provided program logic and the function `func_1` are correct for solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
