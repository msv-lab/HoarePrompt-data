Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, where \( n \) is provided as input.
   - The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) (from 1 to 1000) and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the function `func_1`.

2. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if a number \( x \) is prime.
   - The function first handles small values directly (`x <= 3`).
   - It then checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
   - Finally, it performs a more comprehensive check by iterating through potential divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \).

3. **Behavior of the Main Loop**:
   - For each \( m \), the program computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and passes it to `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program prints \( m \) and exits the loop.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Given the problem statement guarantees that there exists at least one \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, the main logic should work correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to accurately determine primality, ensuring that if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it will eventually be detected.

5. **Edge Cases and Guarantees**:
   - The function `func_1` is robust and covers all necessary cases, including edge cases like \( x = 1 \) or \( x = 2 \).
   - The main loop will terminate as soon as a non-prime number is found, ensuring efficiency.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis.

Correctness: **True**
