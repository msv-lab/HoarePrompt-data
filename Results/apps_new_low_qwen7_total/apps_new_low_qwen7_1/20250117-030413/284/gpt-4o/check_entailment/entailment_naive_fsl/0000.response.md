Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for any given \( n \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime. Once it finds a value of \( m \) that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) non-prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. 

Given the constraints and the guarantees that the answer exists, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \) within the specified range. Therefore, the program works correctly for all inputs as per the problem description.
