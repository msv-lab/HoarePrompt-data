Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find an integer `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The given code correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime.
3. In the main loop, the program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
4. For each value of `m`, it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is not a prime using `func_1`.
5. If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Given the constraints and the guarantee that there exists at least one such `m`, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs of `n`.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is accurate. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` correctly implements a prime-checking algorithm. It efficiently checks divisibility up to the square root of `x`, which is a standard method for primality testing.
- The main loop iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, ensuring that we check a sufficient range of values to find a non-prime number \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
- The program prints the first `m` that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) non-prime and stops, which is acceptable since the problem guarantees that such an `m` exists within the given range.

Since the function `func_1` is correct and the main logic of the program correctly uses this function to find a non-prime number, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Final: **True**
