### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem statement.

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, given \( n \) as input.
   - The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and passes it to the function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` checks if the number is prime using a series of conditions and a loop.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints \( m \) and exits the loop.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is a simple primality test:
     - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
     - It returns `True` for numbers 2 and 3.
     - It checks divisibility by 2 and 3.
     - It then checks divisibility by numbers of the form \( i \) and \( i + 2 \) for \( i \) starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 until \( i \cdot i > x \).

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a number is prime based on the given logic.
   - The main loop will eventually find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime because the problem guarantees the existence of such an \( m \) for any \( n \).
   - The loop is bounded by 1000, ensuring that a solution is found within the constraints.

5. **Annotations and Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the states of the variables and the flow of the program.
   - The loop in `func_1` ensures that no divisors are found up to the square root of \( x \), making the primality check correct.
   - The main loop correctly prints the first \( m \) that satisfies the condition \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

Given the analysis and the provided annotations, the program indeed works as intended and finds a valid \( m \) for any given \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
