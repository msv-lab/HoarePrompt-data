### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The given code uses a function `func_1` to check for primality.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly implements the Miller-Rabin primality test for small numbers. It checks if a number is divisible by small primes (2, 3) and then uses a loop to check for factors up to the square root of the number.
   - The loop increments by 6, checking both \( i \) and \( i + 2 \), which is a common optimization in primality tests.

3. **Main Loop Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Guaranteed Existence of a Non-Prime**:
   - The problem guarantees that there exists at least one \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The loop is designed to find such an \( m \) and will always terminate successfully within the specified range.

5. **Correctness Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic of the code.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers within the given constraints.
   - The main loop iterates over possible values of \( m \) and correctly prints the first non-prime result.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds a value of \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
