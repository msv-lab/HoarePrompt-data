You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns `False` if `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for any such `i`, otherwise it returns `True`. The variable `i` is increased by 6 each time the loop runs, starting from 5.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for values of `i` starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 until `i * i > x`.
    #   - The loop terminates early if `x` is found to be divisible by any such `i` or `i + 2`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `x` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x` and checks divisibility conditions.
    #   - If `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`.
    #   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions provided for the output state after 1, 2, and 3 iterations are consistent with the behavior of the loop.
    #   - The loop ensures that no divisors are found up to the point where `i * i > x`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be such that it is not divisible by any integer `i` or `i + 2` where `i * i <= x`. The variable `i` will be increased by 6 each time, starting from 5, and the function will return `False` if a divisor is found, otherwise it returns `True`.
    return True
    #`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns True if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns False. Since the code does not modify `x` and only checks divisibility conditions, the final value of `x` is the same as its initial value, and the function returns True if no divisors are found.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find an integer `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The given code correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime.
3. In the main loop, the program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
4. For each value of `m`, it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is not a prime using `func_1`.
5. If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Given the constraints and the guarantee that there exists at least one such `m`, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs of `n`.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implemented to find a non-prime number \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

Correctness: **True**
