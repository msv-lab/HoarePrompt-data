Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find an integer `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The given code correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime.
3. In the main loop, the program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
4. For each value of `m`, it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is not a prime using `func_1`.
5. If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Given the constraints and the guarantee that there exists at least one such `m`, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs of `n`.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implemented to find a non-prime number \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

Correctness: **True**
