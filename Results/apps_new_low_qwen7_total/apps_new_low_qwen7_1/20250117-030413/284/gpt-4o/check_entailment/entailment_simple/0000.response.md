### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find a counterexample \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given \( n \).

2. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to check if a number \( x \) is prime.
   - It handles small numbers directly (`x <= 3`).
   - It skips even numbers and multiples of 3 quickly.
   - It uses a loop to check for factors up to \( \sqrt{x} \), but only for numbers of the form \( 6k \pm 1 \).

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly identifies primes for small values.
   - For larger values, it will eventually find a factor if one exists.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is not prime using `func_1`.

5. **Execution**:
   - The loop will find a non-prime value for \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and print the corresponding \( m \).

6. **Correctness of the Code**:
   - The code is designed to find a counterexample \( m \).
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers.
   - The loop guarantees that a non-prime value will be found and printed within the specified range.

Given these points, the code is logically sound and will produce the correct output for any \( n \) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: **True**
