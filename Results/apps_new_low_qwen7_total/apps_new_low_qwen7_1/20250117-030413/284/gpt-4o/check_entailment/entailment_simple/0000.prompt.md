Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns `False` if `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for any such `i`, otherwise it returns `True`. The variable `i` is increased by 6 each time the loop runs, starting from 5.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for values of `i` starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 until `i * i > x`.
    #   - The loop terminates early if `x` is found to be divisible by any such `i` or `i + 2`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `x` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x` and checks divisibility conditions.
    #   - If `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`.
    #   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions provided for the output state after 1, 2, and 3 iterations are consistent with the behavior of the loop.
    #   - The loop ensures that no divisors are found up to the point where `i * i > x`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be such that it is not divisible by any integer `i` or `i + 2` where `i * i <= x`. The variable `i` will be increased by 6 each time, starting from 5, and the function will return `False` if a divisor is found, otherwise it returns `True`.
    return True
    #`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns True if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns False. Since the code does not modify `x` and only checks divisibility conditions, the final value of `x` is the same as its initial value, and the function returns True if no divisors are found.
