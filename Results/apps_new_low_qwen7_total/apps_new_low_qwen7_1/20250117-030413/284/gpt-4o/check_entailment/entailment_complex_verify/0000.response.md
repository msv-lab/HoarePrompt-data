### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to disprove PolandBall's hypothesis by finding an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The provided program iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if a number is prime using a trial division method up to the square root of the number.

2. **Analysis of the Program**:
   - The main loop iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is prime using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints \( m \) and exits the loop.

3. **Analysis of the Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by:
     - Returning `False` if the number is less than or equal to 1.
     - Returning `True` if the number is 2 or 3.
     - Checking divisibility by 2 and 3.
     - Using a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form \( i \) and \( i + 2 \) up to the square root of the number.
   - The loop increments by 6 each time, starting from 5, ensuring that all potential divisors up to the square root are checked.

4. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly determines if a number is prime based on the given logic.
   - The main loop correctly iterates through values of \( m \) and stops when it finds a counterexample.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For any \( n \), there will always be some \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. This is guaranteed by the problem statement and the nature of prime numbers.
   - The program will always find and print such an \( m \) within the specified range.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is designed to work correctly according to the problem description and the annotations support the validity of the approach.
   - The program meets the requirements and constraints of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly identifies a counterexample for any given \( n \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime. Once it finds a value of \( m \) that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) non-prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. Given the constraints and the guarantees that the answer exists, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \) within the specified range. Therefore, the program works correctly for all inputs as per the problem description.
