### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
   - The provided code correctly implements a primality test function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime.
   - The main loop iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - Given the constraints and the guarantee that there exists at least one such \( m \), the program should work correctly for all valid inputs of \( n \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the primality test:
     - Returns `False` if \( x \leq 1 \).
     - Returns `True` if \( x \leq 3 \).
     - Checks if \( x \) is divisible by 2 or 3 and returns `False` if true.
     - Uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form \( i \) and \( i + 2 \) where \( i \) starts from 5 and increments by 6. This efficiently skips even numbers and multiples of 3.
     - Returns `True` if no divisors are found.

3. **Main Loop Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates from \( m = 1 \) to \( m = 1000 \).
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is not a prime using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.
   - Given that there exists at least one \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, the loop will eventually find such an \( m \).

4. **Annotations and Correctness**:
   - The annotations accurately describe the state transitions and the logic flow of the program.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the primality test and ensures that no divisors are missed.
   - The main loop correctly iterates and finds a non-prime number as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to find a counterexample \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The provided code meets all the requirements and guarantees of the problem statement.

**Final:** True
