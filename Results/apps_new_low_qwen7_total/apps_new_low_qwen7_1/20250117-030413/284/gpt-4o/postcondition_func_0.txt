The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a boolean value. It first checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if true. Then, it checks if `x` is less than or equal to 3, returning `True` if true. Next, it verifies if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. After these initial checks, the function enters a loop that increments an integer `i` starting from 5 and checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`. If `x` is found to be divisible by any `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`. The final state of the program is that `x` remains unchanged, and the function returns `True` if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 1 or 2 by returning `False` immediately.
