Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * i <= x`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Initial States Before the Loop**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), \(x > 1\), \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3.
   - `i` is 5.

3. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`.

4. **Check the Initial Values**:
   - Given `i = 5`, then `i * i = 25`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `25` must be less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Ensure the Condition Holds**:
   - Since `x` must satisfy \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), \(x > 1\), \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, we need to check if `x` is at least 25 (since `25` is the smallest value `i * i` can take when `i` is 5).
   - Therefore, `x` must be at least 25.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - `x` must be at least 25 to ensure that the loop condition `i * i <= x` holds true for the first iteration.
   - The initial value of `i` (which is 5) does not need adjustment because it remains constant.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x > 1, x > 3, x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3, and x must be at least 25**, `i` is 5.
