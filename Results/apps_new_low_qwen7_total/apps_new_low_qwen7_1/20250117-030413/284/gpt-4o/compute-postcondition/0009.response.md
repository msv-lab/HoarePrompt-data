The code assigns the value 5 to the variable `i`. The value of `x` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `x`. The initial conditions for `x` (being an integer between 1 and 1000, greater than 1, greater than 3, not divisible by 2, and not divisible by 3) are still valid.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5**
