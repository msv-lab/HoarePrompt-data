Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns True if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns False. Since the code does not modify `x` and only checks divisibility conditions, the final value of `x` is the same as its initial value, and the function returns True if no divisors are found.**
