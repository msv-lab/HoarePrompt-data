The code `i += 6` increments the value of `i` by 6. Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `i`, the only change is the increment operation. The function's return condition remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, and the function returns False if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`; `i` is increased by 6**
