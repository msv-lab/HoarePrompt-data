Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a boolean value. It first checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if true. Then, it checks if `x` is less than or equal to 3, returning `True` if true. Next, it verifies if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. After these initial checks, the function enters a loop that increments an integer `i` starting from 5 and checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`. If `x` is found to be divisible by any `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`. The final state of the program is that `x` remains unchanged, and the function returns `True` if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 1 or 2 by returning `False` immediately.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is 1, the function returns `False`.
- If `x` is 2, the function returns `False`.
- If `x` is 3, the function returns `True`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the loop checks divisibility conditions for values of `i` starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 until `i * i > x`. However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, ensuring no other factors exist up to the square root of `x`. The loop ensures that no divisors are found for values of `i` up to the square root of `x`, but it does not explicitly check beyond that. Therefore, the function correctly identifies numbers like 29, 41, etc., as primes, but it does not explicitly ensure that no divisors exist beyond the square root of `x`.
