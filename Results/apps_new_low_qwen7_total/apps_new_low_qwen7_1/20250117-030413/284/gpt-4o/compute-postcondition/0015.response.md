Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), \(x > 1\), \(x > 3\), \(x\) is not divisible by 2, \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x\) must be at least 25. Additionally, \(x\) is not divisible by any integer \(i\) or \((i + 2)\) where \(i\) is any integer.
   - `i` is increased by 6.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on both `i` and `x`.
   - Since `i` is increased by 6 in each iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` still satisfies the loop condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`.

Given the current state, let's denote the updated value of `i` as `i_new`. Since `i` is increased by 6, `i_new = i + 6`. Therefore, the loop condition becomes \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x\).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x\). Since `x` must be at least 25 and \(i\) is increasing by 6, we need to ensure that `i + 6` is within the range where \((i + 6)^2 \leq x\).

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't determine the exact new value of `i`, but we can ensure that `i + 6` must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq x\).

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` has been increased by 6, and the loop will continue if the new value of `i` still satisfies the condition.

**Final State:**
State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x > 1, x > 3, x is not divisible by 2, x is not divisible by 3, and x must be at least 25, and x is not divisible by any integer i or (i + 2) where i is any integer; `i` is increased by 6 and \((i + 6)^2 \leq x\)**
