The code `i += 6` increments the value of `i` by 6. Given the initial state of `x`, the value of `i` before this operation is not specified, but it must satisfy the conditions: \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), \(x > 1\), \(x > 3\), \(x\) is not divisible by 2, \(x\) is not divisible by 3, \(x \geq 25\), and \(x\) is not divisible by any integer \(i\) or \(i + 2\) where \(i\) is any integer.

After executing `i += 6`, the value of `i` is updated, but the exact initial value of `i` is not given. Therefore, we can only state that `i` is increased by 6.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x > 1, x > 3, x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3, and x must be at least 25, and x is not divisible by any integer i or (i + 2) where i is any integer; `i` is increased by 6.**
