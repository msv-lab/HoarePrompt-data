`i` is incremented by 6, but the exact value of `x` and the previous value of `i` are not specified. However, the condition for returning False remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, where `i` is such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x\), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not change the return value from its initial state (which is False); `i` is increased by 6.
