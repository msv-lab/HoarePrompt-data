You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x is greater than 1, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns `False` if `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for any such `i`, otherwise it returns `True`. The variable `i` is increased by 6 each time the loop runs, starting from 5.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2` for values of `i` starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 until `i * i > x`.
    #   - The loop terminates early if `x` is found to be divisible by any such `i` or `i + 2`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `x` remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 in each iteration.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x` and checks divisibility conditions.
    #   - If `x` is found to be divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`.
    #   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions provided for the output state after 1, 2, and 3 iterations are consistent with the behavior of the loop.
    #   - The loop ensures that no divisors are found up to the point where `i * i > x`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be such that it is not divisible by any integer `i` or `i + 2` where `i * i <= x`. The variable `i` will be increased by 6 each time, starting from 5, and the function will return `False` if a divisor is found, otherwise it returns `True`.
    return True
    #`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns True if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns False. Since the code does not modify `x` and only checks divisibility conditions, the final value of `x` is the same as its initial value, and the function returns True if no divisors are found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `x`, returns `False` in several specific cases and returns `True` if `x` meets certain prime-like conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns False

Case_6: The program returns False if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, and there exists an integer `i` such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x\)

Case_7: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 1 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers `i` such that `i * i <= x`, `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The function returns True if no divisors are found, otherwise it returns False. Since the code does not modify `x` and only checks divisibility conditions, the final value of `x` is the same as its initial value, and the function returns True if no divisors are found.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
