Output State: **i is 2, n is at least 2, increasing is False, constant is True, decreasing is False**

Explanation:
- The first line `increasing = False` sets the variable `increasing` to `False`.
- The second line `constant = True` sets the variable `constant` to `True`.

All other variables (`i`, `n`, `decreasing`) remain unchanged according to the provided code block. The initial conditions state that `n` must be at least 2, which is not altered by the code, and `decreasing` remains `False` as it is not mentioned or changed in the code.
