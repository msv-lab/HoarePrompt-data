The code sets `decreasing` to `True`. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` are updated accordingly. The value of `i` remains 3, `n` remains at least 2, `increasing` remains `False`, `constant` remains unchanged, and `decreasing` is now `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `increasing` is `False`, `constant` is unchanged, `decreasing` is `True`.**
