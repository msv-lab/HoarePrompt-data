The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. Based on the input, the function does not return anything explicitly but processes the array.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers from the input, processes the array, and does not return any value.**
