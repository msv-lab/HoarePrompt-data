The given code reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers from the input. It then initializes three boolean variables: `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing`. However, the code does not provide logic to determine the state of the array (whether it is increasing, constant, or decreasing). Therefore, after running the provided code, the boolean variables remain uninitialized.

Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, increasing is False, constant is False, decreasing is False**
