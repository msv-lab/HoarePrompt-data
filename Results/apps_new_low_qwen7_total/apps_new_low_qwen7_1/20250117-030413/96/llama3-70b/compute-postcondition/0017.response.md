Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False, and the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` remains False. If `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is True. Otherwise, `constant` is False and `decreasing` is True.***
