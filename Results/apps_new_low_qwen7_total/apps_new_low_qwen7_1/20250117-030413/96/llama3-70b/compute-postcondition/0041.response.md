Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `increasing` is either True or False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
- The variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` can change based on the conditions inside the loop. However, their final state depends on the sequence of elements in the array `arr`.

Conditions for the loop:
- The loop will execute `n-1` times if there are no interruptions.
- The loop can terminate early if `print('NO')` is executed due to the condition `if decreasing:`.

Final Values:
- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- `increasing` will be True if the array `arr` is strictly increasing up to the last element checked; otherwise, it will be False.
- `constant` will be True if any two consecutive elements are equal and `increasing` was previously True; otherwise, it will be False.
- `decreasing` will be True if any element is less than its previous element, but this would cause the program to print 'NO' and exit before completing the full loop. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', `decreasing` will be False.

Since the loop does not modify `n`, the final value of `n` will be the same as the initial value.
