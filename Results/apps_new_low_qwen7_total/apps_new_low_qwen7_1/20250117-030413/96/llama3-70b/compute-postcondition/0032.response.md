Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, and `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` maintain their states as specified. Since the if condition is `decreasing` and it is given that the if part does not change the variables when `decreasing` is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
