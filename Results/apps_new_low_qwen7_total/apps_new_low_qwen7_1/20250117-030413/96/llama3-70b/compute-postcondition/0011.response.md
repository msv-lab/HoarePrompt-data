Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is False, `constant` is True, `decreasing` is False, the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` is False, and the current value of `arr[i]` equals `arr[i - 1]`. Since the if condition `increasing` is false, the `constant` flag remains true.***
