`increasing` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `constant`, and `decreasing`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `increasing` is `False`, `constant` maintains its state, and `decreasing` maintains its state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `increasing` is `False`, `constant` maintains its state, and `decreasing` maintains its state.**
