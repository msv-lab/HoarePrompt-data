The code sets `increasing` to `True`. This changes the value of the `increasing` variable from its previous state (which was either `True` or `False`). The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is True, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or remains False.**
