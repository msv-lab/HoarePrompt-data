You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

increasing = False

constant = False

decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `increasing` is either True or False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
    #- The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- The variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` can change based on the conditions inside the loop. However, their final state depends on the sequence of elements in the array `arr`.
    #
    #Conditions for the loop:
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if there are no interruptions.
    #- The loop can terminate early if `print('NO')` is executed due to the condition `if decreasing:`.
    #
    #Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
    #- `increasing` will be True if the array `arr` is strictly increasing up to the last element checked; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `constant` will be True if any two consecutive elements are equal and `increasing` was previously True; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `decreasing` will be True if any element is less than its previous element, but this would cause the program to print 'NO' and exit before completing the full loop. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', `decreasing` will be False.
    #
    #Since the loop does not modify `n`, the final value of `n` will be the same as the initial value.
    print('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers from the input, processes the array, and does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
