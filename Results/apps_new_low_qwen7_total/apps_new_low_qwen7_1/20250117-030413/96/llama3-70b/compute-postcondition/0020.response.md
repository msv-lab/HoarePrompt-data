Output State: **i is 2, n must be at least 2, increasing is either True or remains False, constant is either True or False, decreasing is either True or remains False**

Explanation:
The code consists of two lines. The first line prints 'NO' and does not affect any variables. The second line `exit()` stops the execution of the program immediately, preventing any further lines from being executed. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
