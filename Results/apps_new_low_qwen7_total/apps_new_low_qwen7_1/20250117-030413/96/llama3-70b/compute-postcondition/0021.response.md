Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is either True or remains False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or remains False. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition when the if condition `decreasing` is evaluated to True. Therefore, the overall postcondition is that if `decreasing` is True, then `decreasing` remains True, and all other variables retain their states from the precondition.***
