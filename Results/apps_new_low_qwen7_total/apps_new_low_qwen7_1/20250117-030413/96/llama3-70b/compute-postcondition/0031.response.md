The provided code consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

The first line prints 'NO' to the console but does not modify any variables. The second line immediately terminates the program, preventing any further execution of subsequent lines. Since the program exits after printing 'NO', no variables are updated or retained after this point.

Given the initial state where `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 2, along with the states of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` remaining as specified, these states are not altered by the provided code.

Output State: **i is 3, n is at least 2, increasing, constant, and decreasing maintain their states as specified**
