Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. The variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` maintain their states as follows: if `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is True, and both `increasing` and `decreasing` remain their original states. Otherwise, `decreasing` is True, and `increasing` and `constant` retain their original values.**
