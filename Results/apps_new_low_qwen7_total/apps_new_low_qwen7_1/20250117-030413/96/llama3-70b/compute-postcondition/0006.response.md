The code sets `increasing` to `True`. This changes the value of `increasing` from its previous state, which was `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is True, `constant` is False, `decreasing` is either True or remains False, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[i - 1]`.**
