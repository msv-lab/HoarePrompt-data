The code sets `increasing` to `False`. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `constant`, and `decreasing` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is `False`, `constant` is either `True` or `False`, `decreasing` is either `True` or `False`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is `False`, `constant` is either `True` or `False`, `decreasing` is either `True` or `False**.
