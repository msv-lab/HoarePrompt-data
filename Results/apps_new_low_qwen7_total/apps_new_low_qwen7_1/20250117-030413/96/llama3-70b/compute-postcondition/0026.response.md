Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `increasing` remains either `True` or `False`, `constant` is either `True` or `False`, `decreasing` is either `True` or remains `False`. Since there is no else part, the values of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` do not change from their initial states specified in the precondition.***
