`increasing` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `increasing` changes from `True` to `False`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is False, `constant` is False, `decreasing` is False, and the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` is False, `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]`**
