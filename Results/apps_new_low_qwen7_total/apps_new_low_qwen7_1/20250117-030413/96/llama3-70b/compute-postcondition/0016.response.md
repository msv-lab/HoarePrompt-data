`decreasing` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the value of `decreasing` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is False, `constant` is False, `decreasing` is True, and the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` is still False, `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` since there is no change in these conditions within the if block and the else part is not present.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `increasing` is False, `constant` is False, `decreasing` is True, and the condition `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` is still False, `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]`**
