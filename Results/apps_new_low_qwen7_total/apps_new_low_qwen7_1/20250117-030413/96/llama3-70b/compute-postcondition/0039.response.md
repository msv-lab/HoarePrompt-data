Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, and the states of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` are as follows: 
- If `arr[i]` equals `arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is True, `increasing` is False, and `decreasing` remains unchanged.
- If `arr[i]` does not equal `arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is False, `increasing` is True, and `decreasing` is False.***
