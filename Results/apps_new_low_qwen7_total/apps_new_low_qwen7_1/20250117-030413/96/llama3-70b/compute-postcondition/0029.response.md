Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` maintain their states as follows: if `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`, then `increasing` is True, `constant` is either True or False, and `decreasing` is False. If `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is True, and both `increasing` and `decreasing` remain their original states. Otherwise, `decreasing` is True, and `increasing` and `constant` retain their original values.***
