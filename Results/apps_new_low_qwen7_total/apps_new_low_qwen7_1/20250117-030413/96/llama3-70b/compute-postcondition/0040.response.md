Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[i - 1]`, then `increasing` is True, `constant` is False, and `decreasing` is False. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, then `constant` is True, `increasing` is False, and `decreasing` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `increasing` is False, `constant` is False, and `decreasing` is True.***
