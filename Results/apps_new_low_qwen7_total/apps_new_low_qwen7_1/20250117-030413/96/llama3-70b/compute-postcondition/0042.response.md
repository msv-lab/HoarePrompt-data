The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The conditions inside the loop determine the final values of `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing`.

The final values are determined by the conditions inside the loop:
- `increasing` is True if the array `arr` is strictly increasing up to the last element checked; otherwise, it is False.
- `constant` is True if any two consecutive elements are equal and `increasing` was previously True; otherwise, it is False.
- `decreasing` is True if any element is less than its previous element, but this would cause the program to print 'NO' and exit before completing the full loop. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', `decreasing` is False.

After the loop, the program prints 'YES'. This indicates that the loop completed without finding any contradictions, meaning the array `arr` satisfies the conditions specified.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `increasing` is either True or False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False, the program prints 'YES'**
