Output State: **i is 1, n must be at least 2, increasing is False, constant is True, decreasing is False, the condition arr[i] > arr[i - 1] is False, and the current value of arr[i] equals arr[i - 1]**

Explanation:
- The first line `increasing = False` sets the variable `increasing` to `False`.
- The second line `constant = True` sets the variable `constant` to `True`.

No other variables are modified, and the conditions involving arrays (`arr`) remain unchanged based on the provided code block. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `decreasing`, and the conditions related to `arr` stay the same as per the initial state and precondition.
