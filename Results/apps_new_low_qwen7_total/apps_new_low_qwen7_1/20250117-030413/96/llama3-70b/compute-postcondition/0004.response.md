The provided code block consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

Let's analyze the effect of these lines on the initial state:

- The first line prints 'NO' to the console.
- The second line terminates the program immediately without allowing any further execution of subsequent lines.

Since the program exits right after printing 'NO', no variables are updated or changed by the code. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `increasing`, `constant`, `decreasing`, and `arr[i]` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **i is 1, n must be at least 2, increasing is False, constant is False, decreasing is True, and the current value of arr[i] is greater than arr[i - 1]**
