You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Array of integers is unimodal, if:

  it is strictly increasing in the beginning;  after that it is constant;  after that it is strictly decreasing. 

The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are unimodal: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7], but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is unimodal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1 000) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the given array is unimodal. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 5 5 5 4 2

Output
YES

Input
5
10 20 30 20 10

Output
YES

Input
4
1 2 1 2

Output
NO

Input
7
3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example the array is unimodal, because it is strictly increasing in the beginning (from position 1 to position 2, inclusively), that it is constant (from position 2 to position 4, inclusively) and then it is strictly decreasing (from position 4 to position 6, inclusively).

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    increasing = False
    constant = False
    decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
    print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

increasing = False

constant = False

decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `increasing` is either True or False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
    #- The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- The variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` can change based on the conditions inside the loop. However, their final state depends on the sequence of elements in the array `arr`.
    #
    #Conditions for the loop:
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if there are no interruptions.
    #- The loop can terminate early if `print('NO')` is executed due to the condition `if decreasing:`.
    #
    #Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
    #- `increasing` will be True if the array `arr` is strictly increasing up to the last element checked; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `constant` will be True if any two consecutive elements are equal and `increasing` was previously True; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `decreasing` will be True if any element is less than its previous element, but this would cause the program to print 'NO' and exit before completing the full loop. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', `decreasing` will be False.
    #
    #Since the loop does not modify `n`, the final value of `n` will be the same as the initial value.
    print('YES')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program correctly checks if an array is unimodal, we need to verify if it properly handles all conditions for an unimodal array. The key points are:
1. The array must either be strictly increasing at the start, followed by a constant part, and then strictly decreasing.
2. The transitions between these parts should be handled correctly.
3. The program should print "YES" for unimodal arrays and "NO" for non-unimodal arrays.

Let's analyze the provided code:
- It initializes flags `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` to track the state transitions.
- It iterates through the array starting from the second element.
- If the current element is greater than the previous one, it sets the `increasing` flag.
- If the current element equals the previous one, it toggles the `constant` flag.
- If the current element is less than the previous one, it sets the `decreasing` flag.
- If the `decreasing` flag is set while the `increasing` flag is still true, it prints "NO" immediately and exits.
- After the loop, it prints "YES" if no invalid transitions were found.

This logic seems to cover the transitions and conditions required for an unimodal array correctly. Here are a few test cases that demonstrate its correctness:

1. `[1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 2]` (Expected: YES)
2. `[10, 20, 30, 20, 10]` (Expected: YES)
3. `[1, 2, 1, 2]` (Expected: NO)
4. `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` (Expected: YES)

Given these test cases and the analysis, the provided code appears to handle all edge cases and transitions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
