You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Array of integers is unimodal, if:

  it is strictly increasing in the beginning;  after that it is constant;  after that it is strictly decreasing. 

The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are unimodal: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7], but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is unimodal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1 000) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the given array is unimodal. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 5 5 5 4 2

Output
YES

Input
5
10 20 30 20 10

Output
YES

Input
4
1 2 1 2

Output
NO

Input
7
3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example the array is unimodal, because it is strictly increasing in the beginning (from position 1 to position 2, inclusively), that it is constant (from position 2 to position 4, inclusively) and then it is strictly decreasing (from position 4 to position 6, inclusively).

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    increasing = False
    constant = False
    decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
    print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

increasing = False

constant = False

decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `increasing` is either True or False, `constant` is either True or False, `decreasing` is either True or False.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
    #- The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #- The variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` can change based on the conditions inside the loop. However, their final state depends on the sequence of elements in the array `arr`.
    #
    #Conditions for the loop:
    #- The loop will execute `n-1` times if there are no interruptions.
    #- The loop can terminate early if `print('NO')` is executed due to the condition `if decreasing:`.
    #
    #Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
    #- `increasing` will be True if the array `arr` is strictly increasing up to the last element checked; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `constant` will be True if any two consecutive elements are equal and `increasing` was previously True; otherwise, it will be False.
    #- `decreasing` will be True if any element is less than its previous element, but this would cause the program to print 'NO' and exit before completing the full loop. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', `decreasing` will be False.
    #
    #Since the loop does not modify `n`, the final value of `n` will be the same as the initial value.
    print('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) space-separated integers from the input. It then checks if the sequence of numbers is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or contains only equal consecutive elements. If the sequence meets any of these criteria, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include sequences where the first and last elements are equal, or where all elements are the same. The function also handles the case where the sequence is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing but contains only equal consecutive elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array starts with a constant segment followed by an increasing segment and then a decreasing segment. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
4
2 2 3 1
```

In this case, the array starts with a constant segment (2, 2), then increases (2 to 3), and finally decreases (3 to 1). According to the problem description, this should be considered unimodal. However, the current implementation will not correctly identify this as unimodal because it does not properly account for the transition from constant to increasing and then decreasing.

The program's logic only checks for transitions between increasing, constant, and decreasing states but does not correctly handle the sequence of these states. Specifically, it does not ensure that once a constant segment is identified, the next segment must either continue the constant state or start an increasing segment before transitioning to a decreasing segment.
