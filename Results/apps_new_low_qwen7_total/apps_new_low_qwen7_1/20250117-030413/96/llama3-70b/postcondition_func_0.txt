The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) space-separated integers from the input. It then checks if the sequence of numbers is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or contains only equal consecutive elements. If the sequence meets any of these criteria, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include sequences where the first and last elements are equal, or where all elements are the same. The function also handles the case where the sequence is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing but contains only equal consecutive elements.
