Output State: `dp[i]` is the minimum value obtained by evaluating `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < i` and the substring `s[j:i]` is present in the prefix `s[:j]`. The loop continues to iterate over all possible `j` values until `i` reaches the length of the string `s`. Variables `i` and `n` are updated within the loop, but `dp` is the primary variable affected. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`.

Since the loop iterates over all possible `j` values for each `i` until `i` equals the length of `s`, the final value of `dp[i]` for any `i` will be the result of the minimum calculation involving all valid `j` values. The loop will stop once `i` exceeds the length of `s`.

To summarize, the final output state is:
Output State: **`dp[i]` contains the minimum value obtained by the formula `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < i` and the substring `s[j:i]` is present in the prefix `s[:j]`, with `i` ranging up to the length of `s`.**
