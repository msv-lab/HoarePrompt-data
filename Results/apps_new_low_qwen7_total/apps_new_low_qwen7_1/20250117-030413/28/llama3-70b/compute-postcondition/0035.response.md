Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j + 1 < i <= len(s)`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`. Since there is no else part, the condition `s[j:i] in s[:j]` is checked and if true, `dp[i]` is updated as described; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
