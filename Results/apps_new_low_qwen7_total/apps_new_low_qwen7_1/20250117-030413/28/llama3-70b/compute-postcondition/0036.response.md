The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `s` is a string,
- `i` is an integer,
- `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j + 1 < i <= len(s)`,
- `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes `j + 1`.

Since the loop condition is `j < i`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j + 1 < i`. Given that `j + 1 < i` is the condition at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be true for the next iteration.

Thus, the state of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless the condition `s[j:i] in s[:j]` is met, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, this condition does not directly affect our adjustment.

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j + 2 < i <= len(s)`**
