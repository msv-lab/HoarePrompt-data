Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j + 2 < i <= len(s)`, and the substring `s[j:i]` is checked against the prefix `s[:j]`. If `s[j:i]` is found in `s[:j]`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made either since there is no else part that modifies the state.***
