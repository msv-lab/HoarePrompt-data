Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `dp[i]` is either 3 (if `i` >= 3) or `i` (if `i` < 3)
   - `j` is 2
   - `i` must be greater than 0

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
   ```

3. Let's evaluate the expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`:
   - Since `j` is 2, the expression becomes `(i - 2) // (i - 2 - 2) + 1` which simplifies to `(i - 2) // (i - 4) + 1`.
   - We need to consider different cases for `i`:
     - If `i` is 3 or greater, `i - 4` could be negative, zero, or positive.
     - If `i` is less than 3, the division would be undefined or invalid.

4. Considering the cases:
   - For `i >= 3`:
     - If `i > 4`, `(i - 4)` is positive, so `(i - 2) // (i - 4)` is 1 (since `i - 2` is just 2 more than `i - 4`).
       - So, `(i - 2) // (i - 4) + 1` simplifies to `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - If `i = 4`, `(i - 4)` is 0, so the expression is undefined or results in 0 due to integer division.
     - If `i = 3`, `(i - 4)` is -1, so `(i - 2) // (i - 4)` is undefined or results in 0.
   - For `i < 3`:
     - If `i` is 1 or 2, the expression is undefined due to division by a non-positive number.

5. Now let's update the `dp[i]` values based on these evaluations:
   - If `i >= 3`:
     - If `i > 4`, the new value of `dp[i]` is `min(dp[i], 2)`.
     - If `i = 4`, the value remains as per the initial state.
     - If `i = 3`, the value remains as per the initial state.
   - If `i < 3`:
     - No change as the expression is undefined or invalid.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- For `i >= 3`:
  - If `i` was 3 originally, `dp[i]` remains 3.
  - If `i` was 4 originally, `dp[i]` remains 4.
  - If `i` was greater than 4, `dp[i]` becomes 2 if `dp[i]` was greater than 2.
- For `i < 3`, the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[3]` is 3, `dp[4]` is 4, for `i > 4`, `dp[i]` is 2 if `dp[i]` was greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `i` must be greater than 0.**
