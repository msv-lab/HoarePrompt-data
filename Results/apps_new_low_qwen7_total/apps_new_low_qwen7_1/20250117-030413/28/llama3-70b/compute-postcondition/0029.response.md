Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `j` is initialized by `range(i)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and implicitly `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` satisfies the condition in `range(i)`.
   - For `range(i)` to generate at least one value, `i` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial States Given**:
   - `dp[2]` is 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - Since `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`, the loop will execute at least once if `i` is greater than 0.
   - With `i` being 2, the loop will execute for `j` values of `0` and `1`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - The key is to ensure `i` is greater than 0, which is already given as `i = 2`.
   - There is no specific requirement for `n` other than it being greater than 2, but since `i` is already set to 2, this condition is met indirectly.

6. **Final State Before Loop Execution**:
   - We need to ensure the loop can execute based on the initial conditions.
   - `i` is 2, which means the loop will start with `j = 0` and iterate up to `j = 1`.

### Conclusion

Given the initial conditions and the loop structure, the state of the objects in the loop head must satisfy the following:

- `i` must be greater than 0 (which it is, as `i` is 2).
- `n` must be greater than 2 (which is already given).

Since `i` is 2, the loop will execute for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`dp[2]` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
