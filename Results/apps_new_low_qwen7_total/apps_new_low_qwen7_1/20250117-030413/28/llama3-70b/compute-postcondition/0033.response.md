Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this for loop are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `i-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was previously `k`, it will become `k+1`.
   - The variable `i` remains unchanged within the loop as it is the upper limit of the range.

4. **Update the state**:
   - The initial state is given as: `s` is a string, `i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= j < i <= len(s)`.
   - After one iteration, `j` will increase by 1, so `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `i` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j + 1 < i <= len(s)`**.
