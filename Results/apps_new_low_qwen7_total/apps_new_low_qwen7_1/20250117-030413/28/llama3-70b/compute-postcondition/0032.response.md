Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= j < i <= len(s)`. If the substring `s[j:i]` is present in the prefix `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)`. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where the substring `s[j:i]` is not present in the prefix `s[:j]`.***
