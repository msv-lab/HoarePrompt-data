Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `j` in the range from `0` to `i-1`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so `j` must be less than 1 for the loop to continue. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `dp[1]` is updated based on some condition involving `dp[j]` and the substring `s[j:i]`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value (which is less than 1). Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop, the only possible value for `j` that satisfies `j < i` (where `i` is 1) is `j = 0`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 0 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is a string.
   - `dp[1]` might be updated again during this iteration, but the exact value cannot be determined without the loop body. However, since the problem states that no further changes occur if the condition is not met, we can assume that `dp[1]` remains the same unless the condition in the loop body is met.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 0**
