Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`. Since the else part is not provided, it implies no additional changes to the variables. Therefore, the postcondition remains as the condition derived from the if part.***
