Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `j`.
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`:**
   - According to the given state, `i` is initially 1.

3. **Calculate the range of the loop:**
   - For `i = 1`, the range function `range(i)` will generate the values `[0]`.
   - This means `j` will take the value 0 in the first iteration.

4. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `j` will start at 0 and go up to `i - 1`, and `i` is 1, the loop will indeed execute once (with `j` being 0).

5. **Ensure the state before the loop is valid:**
   - The only requirement here is that `i` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.
   - The dictionary `dp` is not directly affecting the loop execution but is part of the program state.

6. **Summarize the required state before the loop execution:**
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which it is).
   - There is no additional requirement for `dp` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must be:

State: **`i` is 1**
