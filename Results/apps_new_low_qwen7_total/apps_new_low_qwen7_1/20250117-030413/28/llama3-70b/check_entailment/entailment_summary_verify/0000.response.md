### Reasoning:

The provided function `func()` has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Division by Zero**: The expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` in the inner loop can lead to a division by zero error when `i == j`. This is because `i - j - j` becomes zero, causing a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Copying**: The intention seems to be to find the minimum number of operations by leveraging the possibility of copying the string. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where copying the string reduces the number of operations.

Let's break down the function step-by-step:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                # This part is problematic as it leads to division by zero when i == j
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])
```

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**: `dp` is initialized to store the minimum number of operations required to form substrings up to length `i`.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each possible length `i` from 1 to `n`.
- **Inner Loop**: Checks each possible substring ending at `i` and starting at `j` (where `j < i`). If the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`, it attempts to update `dp[i]` based on the previous state `dp[j]`.
- **Problematic Expression**: The expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` is intended to account for the fact that we can copy a substring and append it. However, it fails when `i == j` because `i - j - j` becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error.

Given the problematic expression and the flawed logic for handling the copy operation, the function is not correctly solving the problem. The original assessment correctly identified these issues and provided an example input to demonstrate the problem (`aaabbb`).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately pointed out the logical errors and flaws in the provided function. Therefore, the function is not correct as stated.

**Final: False**
