You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, where `n` is the length of `s` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `s` consists of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It then initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n+1` with all values set to the index itself. For each position `i` from 1 to `n`, it calculates `dp[i]` by checking if the substring `s[j:i]` (for all `j < i`) exists in the prefix `s[:j]`. If such a substring exists, it updates `dp[i]` to the minimum value between its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`. After completing these calculations, it prints the value of `dp[n]`.

This function aims to find the minimum number of operations required to make the string `s` such that no substring is repeated. The final state of the program is that it prints the result of this calculation, which is stored in `dp[n]`. However, there is a potential issue with the division `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` when `i - j - j` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. This should be handled to ensure the function works correctly for all inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the inner loop where it calculates the minimum number of operations. Specifically, the expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` is incorrect. This expression attempts to divide by zero when `i == j`, which will cause a runtime error. Additionally, the logic for copying the string and appending it to itself is flawed. The intended logic should involve checking if a substring can be repeated and reducing the operations accordingly, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
The correct minimum number of operations should be 4 (type 'aaa', then copy, then type 'bbb'). However, the current implementation may not correctly calculate this due to the aforementioned issues.
