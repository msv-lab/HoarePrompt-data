You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input is read from stdin, where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and the second line contains a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

dp = [0] * (n + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: dp is [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]
    print(dp[n])



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations to type a given string `s`.
   - Operations allowed:
     - Add a character to the end of the current string.
     - Copy the entire string and append it to itself, but this can be done at most once.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to type the substring `s[0:i]`.
   - The base case `dp[0] = 0` indicates that typing an empty string takes 0 operations.
   - For each position `i`, `dp[i]` is initially set to `i` (typing each character individually).
   - It then checks if any prefix `s[0:j]` (where `j < i`) is a suffix of the substring `s[0:i]`. If so, it updates `dp[i]` to reflect the optimal number of operations by copying the part typed before `j` and then typing the remaining part.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n` (length of the string).
   - The inner loop iterates up to the current index `i` to check for possible suffix matches with prefixes.
   - The condition `if s[j:i] in s[:j]` checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is a suffix of the prefix `s[:j]`.
   - The update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)` calculates the minimum operations required by considering the previous optimal state and the effect of copying.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The logic inside the inner loop ensures that the program finds the minimum operations efficiently by leveraging previously computed states.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like single-character strings correctly (e.g., "a" needs 1 operation).

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
