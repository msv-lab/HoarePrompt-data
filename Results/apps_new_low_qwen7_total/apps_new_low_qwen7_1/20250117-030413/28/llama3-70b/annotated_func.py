#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input is read from stdin, where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and the second line contains a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

dp = [0] * (n + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: dp is [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]
    print(dp[n])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, where `n` is the length of `s` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `s` consists of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It then initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n+1` with all values set to the index itself. For each position `i` from 1 to `n`, it calculates `dp[i]` by checking if the substring `s[j:i]` (for all `j < i`) exists in the prefix `s[:j]`. If such a substring exists, it updates `dp[i]` to the minimum value between its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`. After completing these calculations, it prints the value of `dp[n]`.

This function aims to find the minimum number of operations required to make the string `s` such that no substring is repeated. The final state of the program is that it prints the result of this calculation, which is stored in `dp[n]`. However, there is a potential issue with the division `(i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` when `i - j - j` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. This should be handled to ensure the function works correctly for all inputs.
