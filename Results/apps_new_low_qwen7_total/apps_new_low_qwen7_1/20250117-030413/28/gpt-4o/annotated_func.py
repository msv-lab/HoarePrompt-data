#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `min_operations` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations, and `n` is the initial length of the string `s`.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns min_operations which is the minimum value found during the loop iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s`, a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It iterates through possible substrings of `s` to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific condition. Specifically, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If the condition is met, it calculates the total number of operations needed and updates `min_operations` to the smallest value found. The function returns `min_operations`, which is the minimum value of operations found during the loop iterations. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or 0, in which case no operations can be performed, and thus `min_operations` should remain `n`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the string `s` contains non-lowercase Latin letters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
