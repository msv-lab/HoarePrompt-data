The initial state is given as `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. 

Let's analyze the code snippet:
```python
operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
```

- The first line calculates the value of `operations`. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute it into the equation: `operations = 2 + 1 + (n - 2 * 2)`. Simplifying this, we get `operations = 3 + (n - 4)` or `operations = n - 1`.
- The second line attempts to assign the minimum value between `min_operations` and `operations` to `min_operations`. However, `min_operations` is not defined before this line, which would raise a NameError if executed. For the sake of providing an output state, let's assume `min_operations` was previously set to some value (let's call it `prev_min_operations`).

Let's proceed under the assumption that `min_operations` was previously defined and had some value. After the execution of the first line, `operations` equals `n - 1`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, the exact value of `n` is unknown, but we can express `operations` in terms of `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.

The final state, considering the modifications and keeping the condition `n > 1`, is:
Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 1, operations is n - 1, min_operations is min(prev_min_operations, n - 1)**
