Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s[:1]` is equal to `s[1:2]`. In this case, `min_operations` is 1. If `s[:i]` is not equal to `s[i:2 * i]`, the overall state remains as `i` being 1, `n` being greater than 1, and no specific change in `min_operations` since there is no else part provided.***
