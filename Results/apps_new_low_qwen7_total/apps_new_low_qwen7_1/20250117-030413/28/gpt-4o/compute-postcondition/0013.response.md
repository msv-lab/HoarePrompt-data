The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s`, which is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns `min_operations`, which is the minimum value found during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, and return the minimum value found during the loop iterations.
