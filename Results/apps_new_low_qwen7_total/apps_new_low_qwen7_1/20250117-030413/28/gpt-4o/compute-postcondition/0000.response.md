The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `min_operations`. Since `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, the value of `min_operations` is set to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `min_operations` is `n`.**
