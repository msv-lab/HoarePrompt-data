Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute for the first time, `i` must be equal to `1` and `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - We know that initially, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `min_operations` is `n`.

4. **Adjust the Initial State:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to `1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must be true.

Given these points, we can conclude that the initial state should be such that `i` is `1` and `n` is greater than `1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1**
