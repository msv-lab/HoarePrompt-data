Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, so the variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues if the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]` is true. If this condition is true, then `i` remains 3. Otherwise, the value of `i` remains unchanged.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `s[:1]` is equal to `s[1:2]`

4. **Evaluate the condition for the current `i` (which is 2)**:
   - We need to check if `s[:2] == s[2:4]`.
   - Given `s[:1]` is equal to `s[1:2]`, let's denote the first character of `s` as `a` and the second character as `b`. Therefore, `s[:1] = 'a'` and `s[1:2] = 'a'`, so `s[:2] = 'aa'`.
   - Now, we need to check `s[2:4]`. Since we don't have information about the characters beyond the first two, we cannot determine if `s[2:4]` is `'aa'` without further details. However, based on the given condition, we assume it is not equal to `'aa'` unless specified otherwise.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `s[:2] != s[2:4]` (based on the assumption that `s[2:4]` is not equal to `'aa'`), the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]` is false.
   - Therefore, `i` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` remaining 2, while `n` must still be greater than 1, and no information changes regarding `s`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
