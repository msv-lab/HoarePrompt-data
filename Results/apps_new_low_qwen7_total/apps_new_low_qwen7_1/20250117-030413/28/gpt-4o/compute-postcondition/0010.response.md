Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. If the substring `s[:i]` is equal to the substring `s[i:2 * i]`, then the operations is `n - 1` and `min_operations` is the minimum of `prev_min_operations` and `n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `operations` and `min_operations` remain unchanged.***
