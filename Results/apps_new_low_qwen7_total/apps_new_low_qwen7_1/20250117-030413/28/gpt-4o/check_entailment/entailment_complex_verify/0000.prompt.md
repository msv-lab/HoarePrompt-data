You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
    return min_operations



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `min_operations` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations, and `n` is the initial length of the string `s`.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns min_operations which is the minimum value found during the loop iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s`, a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It iterates through possible substrings of `s` to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific condition. Specifically, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If the condition is met, it calculates the total number of operations needed and updates `min_operations` to the smallest value found. The function returns `min_operations`, which is the minimum value of operations found during the loop iterations. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 or 0, in which case no operations can be performed, and thus `min_operations` should remain `n`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the string `s` contains non-lowercase Latin letters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string can be divided into two identical halves. Specifically, the program checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]`, but it does not account for the case where the string can be divided into more than two identical parts. For example, consider the string `aaaaa`. The optimal solution would be to type the first 3 characters, copy them, and then type the remaining 2 characters, which would take 5 operations. However, the current implementation only considers dividing the string into two parts and does not explore dividing it into more parts. Therefore, the program does not always provide the minimum number of operations required.
