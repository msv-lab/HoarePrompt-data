You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
    return min_operations



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `min_operations` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations, and `n` is the initial length of the string `s`.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns min_operations which is the minimum value found during the loop iterations



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program aims to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either typing each character one by one or copying a substring and appending it.
2. The main logic is contained within the function `func_1`, which iterates through possible substrings that could be copied.
3. For each possible substring `s[:i]`, it checks if it matches `s[i:2*i]`. If they match, it calculates the total number of operations needed: `i` (to type the initial substring) + 1 (for the copy operation) + (`n - 2*i`) (to type the remaining characters).
4. It keeps track of the minimum number of operations required.
5. The overall logic seems correct for determining the minimum operations, but there is one potential issue with the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]` where `i` could exceed half the length of the string `n`, which would lead to an index out-of-bounds error. This should be handled by ensuring `2*i <= n`.

However, based on the provided code, the logic appears sound and the condition `2*i <= n` is inherently satisfied because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the given program should work correctly without modification.

Correctness: **True**
