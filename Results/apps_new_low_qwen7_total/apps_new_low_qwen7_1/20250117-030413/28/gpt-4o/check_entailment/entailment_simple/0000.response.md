Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations required to type a given string `s` using two types of operations: adding a character to the end of the current string and copying the entire current string and appending it to itself.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of operations needed to construct the string `s`.
   - It initializes `min_operations` with `n`, assuming the worst case where no copying is used.
   - It iterates through possible substrings of `s` that could be repeated to form `s`. Specifically, it checks for a substring of length `i` that repeats twice within the string `s`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to the substring `s[i:2*i]`.
   - If such a substring exists, it calculates the number of operations required:
     - `i` operations to type the substring `s[:i]`.
     - 1 operation to copy the substring `s[:i]`.
     - `(n - 2 * i)` operations to type the remaining characters.
   - It updates `min_operations` with the minimum number of operations found.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `min_operations`, which should be the minimum number of operations required to type the string `s`.

Given the analysis, the logic implemented in the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem. It considers the possibility of copying a substring to minimize the total number of operations.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
