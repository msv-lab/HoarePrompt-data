Reasoning: 
The annotated program provided correctly describes the logic of the `func_1` function. The function aims to find the minimum number of operations required to type the string `s`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `min_operations` to `n`, meaning the initial assumption is that all characters must be typed individually.
2. **Loop Through Possible Substrings**: The function loops through possible substrings of `s` starting from 1 to `n-1`. For each `i`, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to `s[i:2*i]`.
   - If the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2*i]` is met, it means the substring `s[:i]` can be copied to form part of the string. This reduces the number of operations by copying the first `i` characters and then typing the remaining `(n - 2*i)` characters manually.
   - The total number of operations in this scenario would be `i + 1 + (n - 2*i)`, where `i + 1` accounts for the initial typing of the first `i` characters and the copy operation, and `(n - 2*i)` accounts for the remaining characters.
3. **Update Minimum Operations**: The function updates `min_operations` with the minimum value found during the loop iterations.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns `min_operations`.

The overall logic correctly implements the requirement to find the minimum number of operations needed, considering both individual typing and the potential copy operation.

However, there are a few minor points to consider:
- The function assumes that the string `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters, which is implied by the problem statement but should be explicitly mentioned.
- The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or 0, ensuring that no operations are needed.

Given these points, the function correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
