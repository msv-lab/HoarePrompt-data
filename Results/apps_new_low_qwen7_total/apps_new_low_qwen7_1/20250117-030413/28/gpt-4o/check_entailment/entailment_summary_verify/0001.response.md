Reasoning:

1. The program aims to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either typing each character one by one or copying a substring and appending it.
2. The main logic is contained within the function `func_1`, which iterates through possible substrings that could be copied.
3. For each possible substring `s[:i]`, it checks if it matches `s[i:2*i]`. If they match, it calculates the total number of operations needed: `i` (to type the initial substring) + 1 (for the copy operation) + (`n - 2*i`) (to type the remaining characters).
4. It keeps track of the minimum number of operations required.
5. The logic in the function `func_1` is indeed correct for determining the minimum operations, and the condition `2*i <= n` is inherently satisfied because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. There is no risk of an index out-of-bounds error in this context.

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations needed to type the string `s`. The provided code handles the conditions appropriately and does not contain any logical errors based on the given problem description and function summary.

Final: **True**
