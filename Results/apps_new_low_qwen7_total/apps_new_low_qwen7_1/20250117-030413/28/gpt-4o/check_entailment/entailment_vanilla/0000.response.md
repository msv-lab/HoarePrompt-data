Reasoning:

1. The program aims to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either typing each character one by one or copying a substring and appending it.
2. The main logic is contained within the function `func_1`, which iterates through possible substrings that could be copied.
3. For each possible substring `s[:i]`, it checks if it matches `s[i:2*i]`. If they match, it calculates the total number of operations needed: `i` (to type the initial substring) + 1 (for the copy operation) + (`n - 2*i`) (to type the remaining characters).
4. It keeps track of the minimum number of operations required.
5. The overall logic seems correct for determining the minimum operations, but there is one potential issue with the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]` where `i` could exceed half the length of the string `n`, which would lead to an index out-of-bounds error. This should be handled by ensuring `2*i <= n`.

However, based on the provided code, the logic appears sound and the condition `2*i <= n` is inherently satisfied because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the given program should work correctly without modification.

Correctness: **True**
