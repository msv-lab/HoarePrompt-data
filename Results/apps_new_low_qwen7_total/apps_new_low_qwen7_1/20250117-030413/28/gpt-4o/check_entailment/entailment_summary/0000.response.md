Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations required to type the given string `s` using the specified operations.
2. The main logic is implemented in the `func_1` function, which correctly iterates over possible prefixes of the string `s` to check if they can be used to reduce the number of operations.
3. The function correctly updates `min_operations` with the minimum number of operations required when a valid prefix is found.
4. The program handles the case where the string might be a repeated substring, which is the key optimization to reduce the number of operations.
5. The potential edge cases mentioned in the execution summary are correctly handled:
   - When `n` is 1 or 0, the function will correctly return `n` since no operations can be performed.
   - The function correctly ignores non-lowercase Latin letters as the input validation is done implicitly by the problem's constraints.
6. The overall structure and logic of the function align with the problem requirements and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
