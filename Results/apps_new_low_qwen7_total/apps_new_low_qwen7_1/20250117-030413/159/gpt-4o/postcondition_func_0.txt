The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and 2·n integers (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) as input. It then sorts these integers into two teams (`team1` and `team2`) of size `n` each. The function checks whether every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all elements, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundary values (1 or 100), and the input values are at their boundary conditions (1 or 1000). The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n` outside the range [1, 100] or `a_i` outside the range [1, 1000]).
