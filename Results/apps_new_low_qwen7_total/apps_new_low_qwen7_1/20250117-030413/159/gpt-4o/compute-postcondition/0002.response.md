The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. The only change is the output of the program, which is 'YES'. However, the variables `n`, `k`, `ratings`, `team1`, `team2`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ratings` is a list of 2k integers sorted in ascending order, `team1` is the first k elements of `ratings`, `team2` is the last k elements of `ratings`, `possible` is a boolean value indicating if all elements in `team1` are less than the corresponding elements in `team2`, and the current value of `possible` is True; the program prints 'YES'**
