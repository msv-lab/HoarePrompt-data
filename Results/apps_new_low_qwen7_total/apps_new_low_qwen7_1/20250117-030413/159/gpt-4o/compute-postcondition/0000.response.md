Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ 1000.

Given Code:
```python
n = int(input())
ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
ratings.sort()
team1 = ratings[:n]
team2 = ratings[n:]
possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
```

Let's analyze the effects of each line:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`. Let’s denote this integer as `k`.
2. `ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a line of space-separated integers, converts each to an integer, and stores them in a list called `ratings`. Let’s denote these integers as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2k}\).
3. `ratings.sort()`: This sorts the list `ratings` in ascending order.
4. `team1 = ratings[:n]`: This creates a sublist `team1` from the first `n` elements of `ratings`. Given that `n = k`, `team1` consists of the first `k` elements of the sorted list.
5. `team2 = ratings[n:]`: This creates a sublist `team2` from the remaining elements of `ratings` (i.e., from index `n` to the end). Given that `n = k`, `team2` consists of the last `k` elements of the sorted list.
6. `possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))`: This checks if every element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, `possible` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`.

To summarize, after running the code, we have:
- `n` is the integer `k` from the input.
- `ratings` is a list of length `2k` containing integers from the input, sorted in ascending order.
- `team1` is the first `k` elements of the sorted `ratings`.
- `team2` is the last `k` elements of the sorted `ratings`.
- `possible` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `team1` are less than the corresponding elements in `team2`.

Final Output State: **n is an integer k, ratings is a list of 2k integers sorted in ascending order, team1 is the first k elements of ratings, team2 is the last k elements of ratings, possible is a boolean value indicating if all elements in team1 are less than the corresponding elements in team2**.
