The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it is implied that the function takes two lines of input. The first line contains an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000. Based on this input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Given the structure of the problem, the function likely processes the input data but does not return a value directly. However, following the given format:

Functionality: **The function accepts the input of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by 2·n integers (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000). No return value is specified.**
