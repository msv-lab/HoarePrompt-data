Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly divides the players into two teams such that the team of BerOil (the first team) always wins against the team of BerMobile (the second team) in every pair, regardless of the drawing results. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting and Division**: The program sorts the ratings in ascending order and then divides the sorted list into two teams: `team1` (first half) and `team2` (second half). By sorting, we ensure that for any pair formed between a player from `team1` and a player from `team2`, the player from `team1` will always have a higher rating (since `team1` consists of the n highest-rated players and `team2` consists of the n lowest-rated players).

2. **Checking the Condition**: After division, the program checks if `team1[i] < team2[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. Since the ratings are sorted and `team1` contains the highest `n` ratings and `team2` contains the lowest `n` ratings, this condition will always be true, ensuring that the player from `team1` will always win against the player from `team2`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program handles all potential cases correctly and guarantees that the first team will always win in every pair. Therefore, the program is correct.
