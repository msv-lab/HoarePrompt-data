### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The input is correctly read and validated as per the problem statement.
2. **Sorting**: The ratings are sorted in ascending order, which is a key step in ensuring that the highest `n` ratings (which go into `team1`) are higher than the lowest `n` ratings (which go into `team2`).
3. **Team Assignment**: The first `n` elements of the sorted list (`team1`) are assigned to the first team, and the remaining `n` elements (`team2`) are assigned to the second team.
4. **Win Condition Check**: The condition `all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))` ensures that for every index `i`, the element from `team1` is less than the corresponding element from `team2`. This satisfies the condition that the player from `team1` always wins against the player from `team2` in any pair.
5. **Output**: Based on the result of the condition check, the function correctly prints either "YES" or "NO".

Given these points, the logic in the provided program correctly addresses the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
