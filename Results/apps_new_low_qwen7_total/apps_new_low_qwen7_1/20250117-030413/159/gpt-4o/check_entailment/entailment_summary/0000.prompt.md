Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and 2·n integers (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) as input. It then sorts these integers into two teams (`team1` and `team2`) of size `n` each. The function checks whether every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all elements, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at the boundary values (1 or 100), and the input values are at their boundary conditions (1 or 1000). The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `n` outside the range [1, 100] or `a_i` outside the range [1, 1000]).
