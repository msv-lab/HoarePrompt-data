Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to divide the 2·n players into two teams such that the player from the first team always wins against the player from the second team in every pair. Here’s how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of players `n` and then the ratings of the players.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the ratings of the players in ascending order.
3. **Team Assignment**: It assigns the first `n` players to `team1` and the next `n` players to `team2`.
4. **Condition Check**: It checks if every player in `team1` has a rating strictly less than the corresponding player in `team2`. This ensures that no matter how the pairs are drawn, the player from `team1` will always win.
5. **Output**: Based on the condition check, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the logical steps, the program correctly implements the required functionality. It correctly handles the sorting and comparison, ensuring that if the condition holds, the division is valid; otherwise, it is not.

Correctness: **True**
