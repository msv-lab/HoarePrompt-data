### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic implemented in the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of players `n` and their ratings.
2. **Sorting Ratings**: The ratings are sorted in ascending order, which is necessary to compare corresponding players from the two teams.
3. **Team Formation**: The first `n` ratings form `team1`, and the next `n` ratings form `team2`.
4. **Checking Condition**: The program checks if every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition holds for all indices, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The original assessment correctly identifies that:
- For every pair `(team1[i], team2[i])`, `team1[i] < team2[i]` ensures that the player from `team1` will always win against the player from `team2`.
- The sorting step ensures that `team1` consists of the lowest `n` ratings and `team2` consists of the highest `n` ratings.
- The check `all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))` effectively verifies this condition.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to divide the players into two teams such that the first team always wins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the required logic to determine whether it is possible to divide the players into two teams such that the first team always wins.

**Correctness: True**
