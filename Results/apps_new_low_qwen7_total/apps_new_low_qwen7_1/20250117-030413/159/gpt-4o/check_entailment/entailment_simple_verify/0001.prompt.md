You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())

ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))

ratings.sort()

team1 = ratings[:n]

team2 = ratings[n:]

possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
    if possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ratings` is a list of 2k integers sorted in ascending order, `team1` is the first k elements of `ratings`, `team2` is the last k elements of `ratings`. If `possible` is True, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `possible` is False, the function prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that it is possible to divide the 2n players into two teams such that in every possible pairing of one player from each team, the player from the first team always wins. This means that for each corresponding pair of players (one from each team), the player from the first team must have a strictly higher rating than the player from the second team.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` ratings.
2. **Sorting Ratings**: The ratings are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Team Formation**: The first `n` ratings form the first team (`team1`), and the remaining `n` ratings form the second team (`team2`).
4. **Checking Condition**: The program checks if for every player in `team1`, their rating is strictly less than the corresponding player's rating in `team2`.

Given the conditions of the problem:
- We need to ensure that for every pair `(team1[i], team2[i])`, `team1[i] < team2[i]`.
- If this condition holds true, then no matter how the pairs are drawn, the player from `team1` will always win because their rating is always strictly lower than the player's rating from `team2`.

The provided solution correctly implements this logic:
- It sorts the ratings.
- It splits the sorted list into two halves.
- It checks if every element in the first half is less than the corresponding element in the second half.

This ensures that the condition `team1[i] < team2[i]` holds true for all `i`, making it possible for the first team to always win regardless of the random pairings.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the required logic to determine whether it is possible to divide the players into two teams such that the first team always wins.
