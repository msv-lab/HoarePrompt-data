You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())

ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))

ratings.sort()

team1 = ratings[:n]

team2 = ratings[n:]

possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
    if possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ratings` is a list of 2k integers sorted in ascending order, `team1` is the first k elements of `ratings`, `team2` is the last k elements of `ratings`. If `possible` is True, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `possible` is False, the function prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly divides the players into two teams such that the team of BerOil (the first team) always wins against the team of BerMobile (the second team) in every pair, regardless of the drawing results. Here’s why:

1. **Sorting and Division**: The program sorts the ratings in ascending order and then divides the sorted list into two teams: `team1` (first half) and `team2` (second half). By sorting, we ensure that for any pair formed between a player from `team1` and a player from `team2`, the player from `team1` will always have a higher rating (since `team1` consists of the n highest-rated players and `team2` consists of the n lowest-rated players).

2. **Checking the Condition**: After division, the program checks if `team1[i] < team2[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. Since the ratings are sorted and `team1` contains the highest `n` ratings and `team2` contains the lowest `n` ratings, this condition will always be true, ensuring that the player from `team1` will always win against the player from `team2`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program handles all potential cases correctly and guarantees that the first team will always win in every pair. Therefore, the program is correct.
