### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that it is possible to divide the 2n players into two teams such that in every possible pairing of one player from each team, the player from the first team always wins. This means that for each corresponding pair of players (one from each team), the player from the first team must have a strictly higher rating than the player from the second team.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` ratings.
2. **Sorting Ratings**: The ratings are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Team Formation**: The first `n` ratings form the first team (`team1`), and the remaining `n` ratings form the second team (`team2`).
4. **Checking Condition**: The program checks if for every player in `team1`, their rating is strictly less than the corresponding player's rating in `team2`.

Given the conditions of the problem:
- We need to ensure that for every pair `(team1[i], team2[i])`, `team1[i] < team2[i]`.
- If this condition holds true, then no matter how the pairs are drawn, the player from `team1` will always win because their rating is always strictly lower than the player's rating from `team2`.

The provided solution correctly implements this logic:
- It sorts the ratings.
- It splits the sorted list into two halves.
- It checks if every element in the first half is less than the corresponding element in the second half.

This ensures that the condition `team1[i] < team2[i]` holds true for all `i`, making it possible for the first team to always win regardless of the random pairings.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the required logic to determine whether it is possible to divide the players into two teams such that the first team always wins.

**Correctness: True**
