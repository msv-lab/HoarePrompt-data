### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key logic of the program and explains why it works under the given constraints. Let's break down the program step-by-step and verify the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers representing the ratings.
   - It sorts the list of ratings in ascending order.
   - This ensures that the first half of the sorted list (`team1`) contains the highest `n` ratings, and the second half (`team2`) contains the lowest `n` ratings.

2. **Division into Teams**:
   - `team1` is assigned the first `n` elements of the sorted list.
   - `team2` is assigned the last `n` elements of the sorted list.
   - Since the list is sorted, `team1` will contain the `n` highest ratings and `team2` will contain the `n` lowest ratings.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if every element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2` using the `all()` function.
   - Given the sorting, `team1[i]` will always be greater than `team2[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition holds true, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and the logical correctness of the approach. The program indeed guarantees that the first team (with higher ratings) will always win against the second team (with lower ratings) in every pair, regardless of the random pairing determined by the drawing.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the constraints provided.
