`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `t` is a string consisting of `n` zeros, and for all `i` in range `n`, either the substring `t[i:i + len(s)]` is equal to `s` or the concatenation of the substring `t[i + len(s):]` and the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to `s`; `count` is 1.
