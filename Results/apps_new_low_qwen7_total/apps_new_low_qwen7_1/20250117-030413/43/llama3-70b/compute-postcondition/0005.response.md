Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `t` is a string consisting of `n` zeros, and for all `i` in range `n`, either the substring `t[i:i + len(s)]` is equal to `s` or the concatenation of the substring `t[i + len(s):]` and the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to `s`. In the if part, `count` is 1 and remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition is determined solely by the if part.***
