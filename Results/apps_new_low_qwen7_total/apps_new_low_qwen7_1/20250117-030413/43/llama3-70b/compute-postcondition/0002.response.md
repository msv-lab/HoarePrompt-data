The code `t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)` performs the following operations:
1. `bin(i)` converts the integer `i` to its binary representation as a string, prefixed with '0b'.
2. `[2:]` removes the first two characters ('0b') from the binary string.
3. `.zfill(n)` pads the resulting string with leading zeros to ensure its length is `n`.

Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, the binary representation of `i` (which is 0) is "0". After removing the '0b' prefix, we get "0", and padding this with leading zeros to a length of `n` will result in a string of `n` zeros.

Thus, `t` is assigned the value `"0" * n`, which is a string consisting of `n` zeros. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `t` is a string consisting of `n` zeros**
