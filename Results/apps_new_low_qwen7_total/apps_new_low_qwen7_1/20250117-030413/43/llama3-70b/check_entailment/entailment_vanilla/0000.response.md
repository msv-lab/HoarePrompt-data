### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function `func()` step-by-step to verify its correctness according to the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads an integer `n` representing the length of the target string `t`.
   - It then reads a binary string `s` which must be a substring of any cyclical shift of `t`.

2. **Cyclical Shifts Generation:**
   - The function iterates through all possible binary strings `t` of length `n`. There are \(2^n\) such strings.
   - For each binary string `t`, it checks if `t` contains `s` as a substring after any cyclical shift.

3. **Cyclical Shift Check:**
   - The check uses a list comprehension with the `all()` function to validate if `s` is a substring of any of the following:
     - A substring starting at index `i` and ending at `i + len(s)` (part of `t`).
     - A combination of the suffix starting at `i + len(s)` and the prefix ending at `i` (cyclical shift).

4. **Correct Cyclical Substring Check:**
   - The condition `t[i:i + len(s)] == s` directly checks if the substring of `t` from `i` to `i + len(s)` matches `s`.
   - The condition `t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s` checks if the suffix from `i + len(s)` to the end combined with the prefix from the start to `i` forms `s`. This ensures all possible cyclical shifts are checked.

5. **Counting Valid Strings:**
   - If both conditions are met for any shift, the counter `count` is incremented.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the count of valid cyclical strings.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to find all distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring. The code handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints accurately.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
