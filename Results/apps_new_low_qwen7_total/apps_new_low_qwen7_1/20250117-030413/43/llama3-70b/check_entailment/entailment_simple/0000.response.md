Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic inside the function accurately counts the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `s` as described.
   
2. **Cyclical Shifts and Substrings**:
   - The program iterates over all possible binary strings of length `n` using the loop `for i in range(2 ** n)`. This is correct because there are \(2^n\) possible binary strings of length `n`.
   - For each binary string `t`, it checks if `s` appears as a substring in any cyclical shift of `t`.
     - The condition `all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))` is used to check if `s` is a substring of any cyclical shift of `t`.
     - This condition is correct because it considers all possible positions of `s` in `t`, including cyclic shifts.

3. **Counting Valid Strings**:
   - If the condition is met, the counter `count` is incremented. This ensures that only those cyclical strings `t` are counted where `s` appears as a substring.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the program prints the value of `count`, which is the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems to be correct and matches the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
