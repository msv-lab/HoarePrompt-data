Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain a given substring \( s \). Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer \( n \) and the substring \( s \).
2. **Binary String Generation**: The loop generates all possible binary strings of length \( n \) using the range \( 2^n \), converting each integer to a binary string of length \( n \) using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`.
3. **Substring Check**: For each generated binary string \( t \), the program checks if \( s \) is a substring by verifying both conditions:
   - A direct substring check starting at any position \( i \).
   - A cyclical check where the string is split into two parts and checked against \( s \).
4. **Counting Valid Strings**: If either of the conditions is met, the count is incremented.
5. **Output**: Finally, the count of valid cyclical strings is printed.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided solution seems to accurately follow the requirements and logic outlined. There are no apparent errors or omissions in the program that would make it incorrect based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
