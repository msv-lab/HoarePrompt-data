Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and s is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n, containing only the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        
        if all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 4095, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `t` is a binary representation of `i` with leading zeros to make it length `n`, and `count` is the number of integers `j` in the range `0` to `2^n - 1` (inclusive) such that for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n - 1`, the substring `t[i:i + len(s)]` is equal to `s` or the concatenation of the substring `t[i + len(s):]` and the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to `s`.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 40\) and a string `s` containing only '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and `n`. It then checks all possible binary strings of length `n` to see if they contain a specific substring pattern defined by `s`. Specifically, for each binary string, it verifies if either the substring of length `len(s)` starting at index `i` or the concatenation of the substring from index `i + len(s)` to the end and the prefix from the start to index `i` matches `s`. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `count` contains the total number of valid binary strings, and this count is printed. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (40), and when `s` is very short or very long relative to `n`.
