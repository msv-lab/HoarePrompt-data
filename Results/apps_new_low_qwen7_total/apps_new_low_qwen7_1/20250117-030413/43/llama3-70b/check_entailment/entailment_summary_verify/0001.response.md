### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the provided function `func()` and the problem description to ensure the solution is accurate and complete.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads an integer `n` and a binary string `s` as described in the problem statement.

2. **Cyclical Shifts Generation:**
   - The function generates all possible binary strings `t` of length `n`. This is correct since there are \(2^n\) such strings.

3. **Cyclical Shift Check:**
   - The check uses a list comprehension with the `all()` function to validate if `s` is a substring of any of the following:
     - A substring starting at index `i` and ending at `i + len(s)` (part of `t`).
     - A combination of the suffix starting at `i + len(s)` and the prefix ending at `i` (cyclical shift).

4. **Correct Cyclical Substring Check:**
   - The condition `t[i:i + len(s)] == s` directly checks if the substring of `t` from `i` to `i + len(s)` matches `s`.
   - The condition `t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s` checks if the suffix from `i + len(s)` to the end combined with the prefix from the start to `i` forms `s`. This ensures all possible cyclical shifts are checked.

5. **Counting Valid Strings:**
   - If either of the above conditions is met for any shift, the counter `count` is incremented. This means that the function correctly counts all distinct cyclical binary strings that contain `s` as a substring.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the count of valid cyclical strings, which is the desired output.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to find all distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring. The code handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints accurately.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the function, we confirm that the original assessment was accurate. The function correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
