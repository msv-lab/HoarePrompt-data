You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program:
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\)) and returns the \((k+1)\)-th character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k|\). If \(k\) is greater than the length of any integer encountered, the function adjusts \(k\) accordingly until it finds a suitable integer. The final state of the program is such that \(k \leq 0\) and \(n\) is the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k| + 1\), with the character at index \(k\) printed. Potential edge cases include when \(k\) is zero or negative, where the function ensures \(k\) becomes non-positive and prints the first character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k| + 1\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the \( k \)-th digit in the sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers in order. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `k` from the input, representing the position of the digit to be found.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `n` to 1, which represents the current number being processed.
3. **Loop to Find the Correct Digit**:
   - Inside the loop, it converts the current number `n` to a string `s`.
   - It checks if the length of the string `s` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it prints the \( k \)-th digit of `s` (adjusted for 1-based indexing by using `s[k - 1]`) and breaks out of the loop.
   - If not, it subtracts the length of `s` from `k`, effectively moving `k` to the remaining part of the sequence that needs to be searched. Then, it increments `n` to move to the next number.
4. **Termination**: The loop continues until the \( k \)-th digit is found and printed.

This approach works because:
- For each number, the program adjusts `k` and advances through the sequence incrementally.
- The loop ensures that `k` is reduced appropriately as the program moves through the sequence, ensuring that the correct digit is eventually found.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program correctly finds and prints the \( k \)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers.
