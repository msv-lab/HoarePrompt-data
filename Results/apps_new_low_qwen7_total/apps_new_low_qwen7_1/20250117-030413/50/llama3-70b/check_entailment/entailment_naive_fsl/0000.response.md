Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the digit to be found falls within a multi-digit number. Specifically, the program increments `n` and checks if the remaining length `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the current number `s`. However, once `k` is reduced to less than the length of the current number, it directly prints the character at the adjusted position without properly accounting for the position within the number.

For example, consider `k = 21`. The 21st digit in the sequence is '5' which is part of the number '15'. The program will correctly reach the number '15', but instead of checking the length of '15' and then determining the exact digit, it will simply print the character at the position `k - 1`, which is '5'. This works for this specific case, but the logic is flawed because it doesn't handle the general case where the position `k` might fall within the middle digits of a larger number.

To fix this, the program needs to check the length of the current number `s` and ensure that the position `k` is within the bounds of the current number before printing the character. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        length = len(s)
        if k <= length:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= length
        n += 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the digit to be found falls within a multi-digit number.
