You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program: 
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is an integer such that k <= 0, n is an integer such that the length of str(n) is at least |k| + 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the digit to be found falls within a multi-digit number. Specifically, the program increments `n` and checks if the remaining length `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the current number `s`. However, once `k` is reduced to less than the length of the current number, it directly prints the character at the adjusted position without properly accounting for the position within the number.

For example, consider `k = 21`. The 21st digit in the sequence is '5' which is part of the number '15'. The program will correctly reach the number '15', but instead of checking the length of '15' and then determining the exact digit, it will simply print the character at the position `k - 1`, which is '5'. This works for this specific case, but the logic is flawed because it doesn't handle the general case where the position `k` might fall within the middle digits of a larger number.

To fix this, the program needs to check the length of the current number `s` and ensure that the position `k` is within the bounds of the current number before printing the character. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        length = len(s)
        if k <= length:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= length
        n += 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the digit to be found falls within a multi-digit number.
