### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input `k` which is an integer representing the position of the digit in the sequence.
2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The variable `n` starts at 1 and is incremented until the condition `len(s) >= k` is met, where `s` is the string representation of `n`.
   - For each iteration, `k` is reduced by the length of the current number (`len(s)`), ensuring that we account for the digits added by each number.
   - Once `len(s)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints the `(k - 1)`-th character of `s` and breaks out of the loop.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loop ensures that `k` is reduced appropriately by the length of the current number, so it never goes into an infinite loop.
   - After the loop, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 0, indicating that the correct digit has been found and printed.
4. **Output**: The output is the correct digit from the sequence as per the given input.

### Conclusion:

Given the logic and the annotations, the program appears to correctly find and print the $k$-th digit of the sequence.

### Correctness:
**True**
