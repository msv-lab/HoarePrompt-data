Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) â€” the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Output

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is an integer such that k <= 0, n is an integer such that the length of str(n) is at least |k| + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\)) and returns the \((k+1)\)-th character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k|\). If \(k\) is greater than the length of any integer encountered, the function adjusts \(k\) accordingly until it finds a suitable integer. The final state of the program is such that \(k \leq 0\) and \(n\) is the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k| + 1\), with the character at index \(k\) printed. Potential edge cases include when \(k\) is zero or negative, where the function ensures \(k\) becomes non-positive and prints the first character of the smallest integer whose length is at least \(|k| + 1\).
