The loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no break statements within the loop body. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop head to terminate the loop, we do not need to adjust any states based on the loop condition.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed to the next iteration, which means we need to maintain the state such that the loop continues to run. In this case, since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute another iteration unless explicitly terminated by a break statement inside the loop.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the states based on the loop condition itself.

State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12 - len(s), `n` is 2**
