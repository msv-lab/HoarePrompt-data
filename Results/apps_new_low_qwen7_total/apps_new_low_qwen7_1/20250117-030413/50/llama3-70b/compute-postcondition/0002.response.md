`s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`. Since `n` is 1, `s` is assigned the string "1". The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, `n` is 1, `s` is "1".
Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, `n` is 1, `s` is "1"**
