For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute because it is a `while True` loop, which means it will run indefinitely as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of the loop.

Since the loop will always execute, no adjustments are needed to the variables `k` and `n` for the loop to enter the first iteration. The current state of the variables already ensures that the loop will proceed.

Therefore, we can repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, `n` is 1**
