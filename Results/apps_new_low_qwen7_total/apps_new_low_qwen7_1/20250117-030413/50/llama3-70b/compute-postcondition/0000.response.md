Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, n is 1**

Explanation: The first line of the code takes an integer input and assigns it to `k`. The second line initializes `n` to 1. Since no further operations are performed on these variables within the given code block, the final state of `k` remains as the input integer within the specified range, and `n` is set to 1.
