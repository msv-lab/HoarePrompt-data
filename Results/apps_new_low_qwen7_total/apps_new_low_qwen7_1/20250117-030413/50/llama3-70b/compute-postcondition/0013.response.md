The code `s = str(n)` converts the integer `n` to a string and assigns it to `s`. The value of `n` is 3, so `s` will be assigned the string `"3"`. The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12 - 1; `n` is 3; `s` is the string `"3"`.
Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12 - 1; `n` is 3; `s` is the string `"3"`**
