Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not consider all possible ways to place the paintings on the board. Specifically, it only checks if one painting can fit horizontally or vertically, but it does not check all permutations of orientations for the paintings. For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
4 2
2 3
1 2
```

The program would incorrectly output 'NO', but it is actually possible to place the paintings as follows:

- Place the 2x3 painting horizontally along the width of the board.
- Place the 1x2 painting vertically along the height of the board.

This configuration fits within the 4x2 board, so the program should output 'YES'. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly.
