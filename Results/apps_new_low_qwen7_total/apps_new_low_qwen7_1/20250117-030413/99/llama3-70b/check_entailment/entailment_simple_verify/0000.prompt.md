You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not consider all possible ways to place the paintings on the board. Specifically, it only checks if one painting can fit horizontally or vertically, but it does not check all permutations of orientations for the paintings. For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
4 2
2 3
1 2
```

The program would incorrectly output 'NO', but it is actually possible to place the paintings as follows:

- Place the 2x3 painting horizontally along the width of the board.
- Place the 1x2 painting vertically along the height of the board.

This configuration fits within the 4x2 board, so the program should output 'YES'. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly.
