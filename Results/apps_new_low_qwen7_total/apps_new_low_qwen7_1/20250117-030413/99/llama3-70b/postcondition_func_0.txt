The function accepts four positive integers `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` as input, representing the dimensions of a board and a painting respectively. It also implicitly takes `a3` and `b3` as additional input, which are the dimensions of another painting. The function checks if the first painting can fit within the board dimensions and whether it can fit within the second painting's dimensions based on the given conditions. If the first painting fits within both the board and the second painting, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly; it only prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated.
