Postcondition: ***`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are positive integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, the condition remains true. Otherwise, the condition becomes false.***
