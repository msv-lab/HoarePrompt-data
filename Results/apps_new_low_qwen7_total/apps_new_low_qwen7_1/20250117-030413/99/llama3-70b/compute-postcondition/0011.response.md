The code `print('NO')` does not change any of the variables' values. It only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **a1 is a positive integer, b1 is a positive integer, a2 is a positive integer, b2 is a positive integer, a3 is a positive integer, b3 is a positive integer. Either max(a1, b1) is less than max(a3, b3) or min(a1, b1) is less than min(a3, b3).**
