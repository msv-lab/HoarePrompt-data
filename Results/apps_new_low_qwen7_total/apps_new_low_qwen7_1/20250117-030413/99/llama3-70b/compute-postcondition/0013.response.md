Postcondition: ***`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are positive integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a2` and `b2`, the condition remains true and the current values of `max(a1, b1)` and `min(a1, b1)` remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `max(a1, b1) < max(a2, b2)` or `min(a1, b1) < min(a2, b2)`.***
