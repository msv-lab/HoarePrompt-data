Postcondition: ***a1 is a positive integer, b1 is a positive integer, a2 is a positive integer, b2 is a positive integer, a3 is a positive integer, b3 is a positive integer. If max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3), the current values of max(a1, b1) and min(a1, b1) remain unchanged. Otherwise, either max(a1, b1) < max(a3, b3) or min(a1, b1) < min(a3, b3).***
