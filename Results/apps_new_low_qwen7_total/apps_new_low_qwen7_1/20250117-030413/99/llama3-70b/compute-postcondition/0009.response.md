The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, or `b3`. Therefore, the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **a1 is a positive integer, b1 is a positive integer, a2 is a positive integer, b2 is a positive integer, a3 is a positive integer, b3 is a positive integer. max(a1, b1) < max(a2, b2) or min(a1, b1) < min(a2, b2). The current values of max(a1, b1) and min(a1, b1) are greater than or equal to max(a3, b3) and min(a3, b3) respectively.**
