The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the difference in the count of numbers up to `r` and up to `l-1` that have exactly `k` different digits, and returns this difference modulo a constant value (`MOD`, usually \(10^9 + 7\)). The function uses memoization through a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results of the `count` function to improve efficiency. 

Potential edge cases include when `l` or `r` is equal to 0, or when `k` is 0 or 10. If `k` is 0, the function should return 0 because no number can have 0 different digits. If `k` is 10, the function should return 1 if `l` and `r` are within the range of 1 to 10 (inclusive), otherwise, it should return 0 because the maximum number of unique digits a number can have within the given constraints is 10. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function should still calculate the difference correctly, which will result in a negative number, but due to the modulo operation, it will wrap around to a positive value.
