The code snippet modifies the value of `dp[n, k]`. However, since `dp` is not defined in the initial state, and the exact definition of `dp` is not provided, we can assume that `dp[n, k]` was previously set to some value before this line of code. Given the initial state where `i` is 3 and `k` remains the same, the code updates `dp[n, k]` by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `i - 1` is `3 - 1 = 2`.
- `10 ** (k - i)` is `10 ** (k - 3)`.
- `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 2 = 100`.

So, the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` becomes:
- `9 * 100 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

Since `10 ** (k - 3)` represents a power of 10, let's denote it as `A` for simplicity:
- The expression becomes `900 * (A - 100)`.

Therefore, `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)` to its previous value.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `k` remains the same (unchanged).

The Output State is:
**`i` is 3, `k` remains the same, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)` to its previous value.**
