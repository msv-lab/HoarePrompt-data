To determine the state of the objects when the loop first executes, we need to consider what conditions must be met for the loop to enter its first iteration.

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, k)`, meaning `i` should start from 1 and go up to `k-1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be equal to 1.

2. **Variable `k`:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1, `k` must be greater than 1 (otherwise, the range would be empty).

3. **Dictionary `dp`:**
   - The dictionary `dp` contains the key `(n, k): 9`, indicating that the key `(n, k)` exists in the dictionary with the value 9.
   - This key being present in the dictionary does not directly affect the loop's first execution, but it must be consistent with the current state.

4. **Integer `n`:**
   - The condition `n >= 10` is not mentioned, so `n` can be any integer.
   - However, the presence of the key `(n, k): 9` in the dictionary implies that `n` and `k` must form a valid key for the dictionary, which means `n` can be any integer and `k` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10.

Given these points, let's formulate the state:

- `i` must be 1.
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- The key `(n, k): 9` must exist in the dictionary `dp`.

Thus, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, and the key `(n, k): 9` must exist in the dictionary `dp`**.
