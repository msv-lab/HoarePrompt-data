Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding \(9 \times 10^3 \times (10^{k-4} - 10^3)\) to its previous value.**

### Analysis:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = k-1`.
   - The loop modifies the dictionary `dp` with the key `(n, k)` by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to the current value of `dp[n, k]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `k` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `dp[n, k]` is updated in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 1 to `k-1`, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated.
   - The final value of `dp[n, k]` will be the initial value plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `dp[n, k]` will be the initial value (which is 9) plus the sum of the terms for each `i` from 1 to `k-1`.
   - Specifically, the contribution for each `i` is `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`.
   - For `i = 3`, the term is `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.
   - For `i = 4`, the term is `9000 * (10 ** (k - 4) - 1000)`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The final value of `dp[n, k]` is the sum of all these contributions.
   - Since the loop runs `k-1` times, the final value of `dp[n, k]` is:
     \[
     dp[n, k] = 9 + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 9 \times 10^{i-1} \times (10^{k-i} - 10^{i-1})
     \]

Given the above analysis, the final output state after the loop has executed is:
**`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding \(9 \times 10^3 \times (10^{k-4} - 10^3)\) to its previous value.**
