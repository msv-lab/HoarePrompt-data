Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` remains unchanged.
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - Since `k` remains the same, `k` still needs to be `k`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `k` remains the same.

Given the conditions and the loop head variables, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4, `k` remains the same**
