The code `dp[n, k] = 9` assigns the value 9 to the key `(n, k)` in the dictionary `dp`. Since the initial value of `dp[n, k]` was not specified (only that `(n, k)` is not in `dp`), it means that this is the first time this key-value pair is being added to the dictionary.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `dp` now contains the key-value pair `(n, k): 9`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `dp` for other keys remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with the key-value pair `(n, k): 9`, and `(n >= 10` is not mentioned and remains as a condition.**
