Precondition: **n (represented by `n` in the function), k (represented by `k` in the function), and `dp` (a dictionary used for memoization) where `n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary used to store previously computed results for the function `count`.**
