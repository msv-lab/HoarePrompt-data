Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers between \( l \) and \( r \) (inclusive) that contain at most \( k \) different digits, and the result should be returned modulo \( 998244353 \).
2. The solution uses dynamic programming to count how many numbers within the given range have at most \( k \) different digits.
3. `func_1` computes the required sum by subtracting the count of numbers less than \( l \) with at most \( k \) different digits from the count of numbers up to \( r \) with at most \( k \) different digits.
4. `count` function calculates the number of integers up to \( n \) that have at most \( k \) different digits.
5. The logic in `count` function seems to correctly account for the number of valid numbers based on the constraints provided.

Given the structure and the logical steps in both functions, the implementation appears to follow the problem requirements accurately. There's no apparent flaw in the provided code that would cause it to produce incorrect results for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
