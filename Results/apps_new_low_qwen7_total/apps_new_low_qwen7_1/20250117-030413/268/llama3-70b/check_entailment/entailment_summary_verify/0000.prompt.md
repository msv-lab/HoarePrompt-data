You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):

    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. 

- If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- If the key `(n, k)` is already present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored in `dp` for the key `(n, k)`.
- If neither of the above conditions hold, the function checks whether `n` is less than \(10^k\). If true, `dp[n, k]` is directly set to `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated to its previous value plus \((10^{(k-1)} - 10^{(k-2)}) \times (n // 10^{(k-1)} - 1)\) modulo `MOD`. The function then returns the updated value stored in `dp[n, k]`.

After the function concludes, the final state of the program will be that `dp[n, k]` contains either 0, the value stored in `dp` for the key `(n, k)`, or an updated value based on the specified conditions. The returned value will reflect one of these states depending on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the contents of `dp`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the intended logic.

### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The `count` function calculates the sum of numbers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits. However, it does not properly handle the summation of numbers between `l` and `r`.
   - The formula used in the `count` function does not correctly sum the numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`. Instead, it seems to calculate the sum of numbers up to `n` that satisfy the condition and then subtract the sum of numbers up to `l-1`.

2. **Missing Summation Between `l` and `r`**:
   - The `func_1` function computes `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD`, which attempts to find the sum between `l` and `r` by subtracting the sums up to `l-1` and `r`. However, this approach does not ensure that only numbers within the range `[l, r]` are considered.
   - Additionally, the logic to filter numbers based on the condition of containing at most `k` different digits is not properly implemented.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the example where `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`. The correct output should be calculated by summing numbers like `11, 22, 33, 44` and other numbers that meet the criteria. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect result.
