Reasoning:
The provided solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `count`. Let's break down how they work and ensure they meet the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the difference between the counts of numbers up to `r` and up to `l-1` that have at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses memoization to store intermediate results in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations, which is efficient.
   - The calculation is done using the `count` function, ensuring it respects the modulo operation.
   - Edge cases like `k` being 0 or 10 are handled appropriately.

2. **Function `count`:**
   - This function calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits up to a given number `n`.
   - It handles different scenarios based on the value of `k` and ensures the result is stored in the `dp` dictionary to avoid recomputation.
   - The logic is sound and follows the problem constraints effectively.

Both functions together ensure that the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` with at most `k` different digits is calculated correctly and efficiently. The use of modulo ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the implementation appears to meet all the requirements without any logical flaws or edge cases not handled properly.

Correctness: **True**
