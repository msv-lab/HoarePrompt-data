Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the intended logic.

### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The `count` function calculates the sum of numbers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits. However, it does not properly handle the summation of numbers between `l` and `r`.
   - The formula used in the `count` function does not correctly sum the numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`. Instead, it seems to calculate the sum of numbers up to `n` that satisfy the condition and then subtract the sum of numbers up to `l-1`.

2. **Missing Summation Between `l` and `r`**:
   - The `func_1` function computes `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD`, which attempts to find the sum between `l` and `r` by subtracting the sums up to `l-1` and `r`. However, this approach does not ensure that only numbers within the range `[l, r]` are considered.
   - Additionally, the logic to filter numbers based on the condition of containing at most `k` different digits is not properly implemented.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the example where `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`. The correct output should be calculated by summing numbers like `11, 22, 33, 44` and other numbers that meet the criteria. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect result.
