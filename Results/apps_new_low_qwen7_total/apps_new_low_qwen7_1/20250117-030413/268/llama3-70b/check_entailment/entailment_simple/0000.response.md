### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the sum of numbers within a given range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits, and then prints this sum modulo `998244353`. The logic involves two main functions: `func_1` and `count`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the count of numbers from `l` to `r` that have at most `k` different digits using memoized recursion through the `count` function.
   - Specifically, it computes the difference between the counts of numbers up to `r` and up to `l-1`, effectively giving the count of numbers within the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Function `count`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming with memoization to count the numbers up to `n` that have at most `k` different digits.
   - It handles base cases where `k` is zero or `n` is less than \(10^k\).
   - For larger `n`, it iteratively builds the count by considering different possible digits and their positions.

Given the problem constraints and the logical flow of the code, the program seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The use of memoization ensures efficient computation even for large values of `r` and `k`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input constraints.
- The logic for counting numbers with at most `k` different digits is implemented accurately.
- The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the logical structure of the code, the program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
