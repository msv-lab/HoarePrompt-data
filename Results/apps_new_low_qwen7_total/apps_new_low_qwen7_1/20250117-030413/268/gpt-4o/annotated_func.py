#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer between 1 and 10). It returns `True` if the number of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function first converts the integer `n` to its string representation, then creates a set of characters from this string to find the unique characters. It then checks if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`. This process covers all potential edge cases where `n` could be any integer and `k` is within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `num` is equal to `r + 1` (or `r + 1` if `r + 1` is within the range `[l, r]`, otherwise `num` is undefined), `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.
    return total_sum
    #`The program returns total_sum which is the sum of all numbers i in the range [l, r] where func_1(i, k) is true, modulo MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates over all integers `num` in the range `[l, r]` (inclusive). For each `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. If so, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r` (though the function ensures `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`), and when `r + 1` is outside the range `[l, r]`, in which case `num` remains undefined. However, the function correctly handles these conditions by iterating only within the specified range.
