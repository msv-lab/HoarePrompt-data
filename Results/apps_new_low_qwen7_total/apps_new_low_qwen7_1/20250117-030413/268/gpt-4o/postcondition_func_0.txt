The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer between 1 and 10). It returns `True` if the number of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function first converts the integer `n` to its string representation, then creates a set of characters from this string to find the unique characters. It then checks if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`. This process covers all potential edge cases where `n` could be any integer and `k` is within the specified range.
