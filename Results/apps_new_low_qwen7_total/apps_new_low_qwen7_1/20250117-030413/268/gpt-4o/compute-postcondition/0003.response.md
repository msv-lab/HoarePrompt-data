`total_sum` is incremented by `num` and then taken modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. So, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`.

The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `total_sum`, and `num` are updated, but the conditions and relationships between these variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns True.**
