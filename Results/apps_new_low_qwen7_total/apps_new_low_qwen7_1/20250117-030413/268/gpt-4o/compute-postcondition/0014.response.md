Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates over all integers `num` in the range `[l, r]` (inclusive). For each `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. If so, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r` (though the function ensures `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`), and when `r + 1` is outside the range `[l, r]`, in which case `num` remains undefined. However, the function correctly handles these conditions by iterating only within the specified range.**

**Note:** The annotation stating that `num` is equal to `r + 1` (or `r + 1` if `r + 1` is within the range `[l, r]`) is incorrect. The variable `num` will iterate through all values from `l` to `r` inclusive during the loop, not end up as `r + 1`.
