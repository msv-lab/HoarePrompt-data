Output State: **`l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `num` is equal to `r + 1` (or `r + 1` if `r + 1` is within the range `[l, r]`, otherwise `num` is undefined), `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each number `num` in the range `[l, r]`.
   - For each `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` is true.
   - If true, it updates `total_sum` to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - **Variable `num`**: This variable changes to each value in the range `[l, r]`.
   - **Variable `total_sum`**: It accumulates the sum of all numbers `num` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(num, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `num` will be equal to `r + 1` (or `r + 1` if `r + 1` is still within the range `[l, r]`, otherwise `num` will be undefined).
   - `total_sum` will be the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The behavior described aligns with the provided output states, confirming that `num` takes on each value in the range `[l, r]` and `total_sum` is updated accordingly based on the condition `func_1(num, k)`.
   - The loop continues until `num` exceeds `r`, at which point `num` is undefined if `r + 1` is out of the range `[l, r]`.

Therefore, the final state after all executions of the loop is as stated above.
