Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `num` and the range it iterates over (`l` to `r`). The other variables (`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `func_1`) are not in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)
   - `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)
   - `total_sum` is `l % MOD`
   - `num` is equal to `l`

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be in the range `[l, r]`. Since `num` was equal to `l` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `num` will be `l + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: The only variable that changes in the loop head is `num`. It will be incremented to `l + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`**
