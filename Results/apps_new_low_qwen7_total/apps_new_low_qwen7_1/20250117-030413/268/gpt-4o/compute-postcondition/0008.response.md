Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `num`, `l`, and `r`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).
   - `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
   - `total_sum` is \((l \% \text{MOD} + l + 1) \% \text{MOD}\).
   - `num` is equal to `l + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `num` from `l` to `r` inclusive. The loop continues as long as `num` is within this range.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was equal to `l + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1, so `num` will be `l + 2`.
   - `l` and `r` remain the same because they are not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total_sum` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify it directly unless the condition in `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, but since we don't know the outcome of `func_1`, we assume it remains the same.
   - `num` becomes `l + 2`.
   - `l` and `r` remain the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `total_sum` is \((l \% \text{MOD} + l + 1) \% \text{MOD}\), `num` is equal to `l + 2`.**
