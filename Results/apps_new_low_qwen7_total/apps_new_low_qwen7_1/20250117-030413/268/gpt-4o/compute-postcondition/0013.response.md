The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. 

- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).

After executing the function body, the program returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers \(i\) in the range \([l, r]\) where `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of all numbers \(i\) in the range \([l, r]\) for which `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers \(i\) in the range \([l, r]\) for which `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.**
