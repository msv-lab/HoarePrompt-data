Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `total_sum` is \((l \% \text{MOD} + l + 1) \% \text{MOD}\), `num` is equal to `l + 1`. If the condition in `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to \((l \% \text{MOD} + l + 1) \% \text{MOD}\). Since there is no else part, the value of `total_sum` remains unchanged if the condition in `func_1(num, k)` is false.***
