The code initializes `total_sum` to 0 but does not perform any operations that would affect the values of `l`, `r`, or `k`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0**
