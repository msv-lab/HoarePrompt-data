Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, `total_sum` remains `l % MOD`. No else part is provided, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition.***
