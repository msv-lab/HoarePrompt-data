Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `r` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\), `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `total_sum` is updated to \(((l \% \text{MOD} + l + 1) \% \text{MOD} + (l + 2)) \% \text{MOD}\) if `func_1(num, k)` is true.***
