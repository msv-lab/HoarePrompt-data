You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates over all integers `num` in the range `[l, r]` (inclusive). For each `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`. If so, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers `i` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(i, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`. Potential edge cases include when `l > r` (though the function ensures `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`), and when `r + 1` is outside the range `[l, r]`, in which case `num` remains undefined. However, the function correctly handles these conditions by iterating only within the specified range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **func_1 Function**: 
   - This function checks if a number `n` has at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number `n` to a string, then to a set of characters, and finally checks the length of the set.
   - The function `len(set(str(n)))` returns the number of unique digits in `n`.
   - If this count is less than or equal to `k`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **func_2 Function**:
   - This function calculates the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits.
   - It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`.
   - For each number, it calls `func_1` to check if the number has at most `k` different digits.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it adds the number to `total_sum`.
   - After the loop, it returns the total sum modulo `998244353`.

The implementation follows the problem statement correctly:
- The condition `l <= r` is implicitly handled by the loop range.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
- The use of `func_1` inside the loop checks each number individually for the digit constraint.

Given that the logic and the implementation align with the problem requirements, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
