Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the purpose and logic of both functions. Let's systematically verify the program's behavior against the problem description and the annotated version:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to sum numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits, and return the result modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the number `n` to a string.
   - Converts the string to a set of characters to get unique digits.
   - Checks if the size of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Returns `True` if the number has at most `k` different digits, `False` otherwise.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes `total_sum` to 0.
   - Iterates over each number `num` in the range `[l, r]`.
   - Calls `func_1` to check if `num` has at most `k` different digits.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, adds `num` to `total_sum`.
   - After the loop, returns `total_sum % MOD`.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the input values `l`, `r`, and `k`.
   - Calls `func_2(l, r, k)` and prints the result.
   - The states at key points are consistent with the problem description and the logical flow of the functions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `l == r` correctly.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied after summing the valid numbers, ensuring the final result is within the required bounds.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies identified in the code based on the provided problem description and annotations.

Final: **True**
