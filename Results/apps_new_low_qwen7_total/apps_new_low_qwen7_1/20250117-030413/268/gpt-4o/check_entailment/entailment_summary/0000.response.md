Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, creating a set of its characters, and checking the size of this set.
   - This implementation handles all edge cases, including very large numbers, as the set operation is efficient even for large strings (representations of large integers).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `num`, it uses `func_1` to check if `num` has at most `k` different digits.
   - If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `998244353`.
   - The function correctly handles the inclusive range and the modulo operation, ensuring the final sum is computed accurately.

Given that both functions work as intended and cover all necessary aspects of the problem, the program as a whole meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
