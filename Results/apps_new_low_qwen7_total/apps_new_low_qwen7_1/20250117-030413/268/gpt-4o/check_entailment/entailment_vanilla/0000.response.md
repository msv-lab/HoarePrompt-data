Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **func_1 Function**: 
   - This function checks if a number `n` has at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number `n` to a string, then to a set of characters, and finally checks the length of the set.
   - The function `len(set(str(n)))` returns the number of unique digits in `n`.
   - If this count is less than or equal to `k`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **func_2 Function**:
   - This function calculates the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits.
   - It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`.
   - For each number, it calls `func_1` to check if the number has at most `k` different digits.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it adds the number to `total_sum`.
   - After the loop, it returns the total sum modulo `998244353`.

The implementation follows the problem statement correctly:
- The condition `l <= r` is implicitly handled by the loop range.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
- The use of `func_1` inside the loop checks each number individually for the digit constraint.

Given that the logic and the implementation align with the problem requirements, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
