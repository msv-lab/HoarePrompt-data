### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the annotated code and the problem description to understand the logic and correctness of the program.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Checks if a number `n` has at most `k` unique digits.
   - This is done by converting `n` to its string representation, creating a set of characters, and checking if the size of the set is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Iterates through all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `num`, it checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`.
   - If `True`, it adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `998244353`.

Given the problem statement, the task is to sum all numbers in the range `[l, r]` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The annotated code and the provided functions correctly implement this logic:

- The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number has at most `k` different digits.
- The function `func_2` iterates through the range `[l, r]` and sums only those numbers that pass the `func_1` test.

Based on the annotations, the program correctly follows the problem requirements and handles the given constraints.

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment claimed that the program incorrectly includes numbers with more than `k` different digits. However, the provided code correctly uses the `func_1` function to filter out numbers with more than `k` different digits.
- The annotated code and the problem description clearly show that the logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
