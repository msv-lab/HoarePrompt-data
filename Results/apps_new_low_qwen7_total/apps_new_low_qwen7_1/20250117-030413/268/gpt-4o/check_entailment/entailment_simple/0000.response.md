Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines and uses the `func_1` function to check if a number has at most `k` different digits.
2. The program iterates over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and includes a number in the sum only if `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`.
3. The final result is returned modulo `998244353` as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program logic appears to be sound. It checks each number in the specified range to see if it meets the criteria (having at most `k` different digits), and sums those numbers up correctly, returning the result modulo `998244353`.

Correctness: **True**
