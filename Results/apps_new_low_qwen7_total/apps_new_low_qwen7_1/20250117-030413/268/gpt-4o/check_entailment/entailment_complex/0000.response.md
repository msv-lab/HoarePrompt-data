Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the integer `n` to its string representation, then uses a set to find the unique characters in the string.
   - It returns `True` if the size of the set is less than or equal to `k`, and `False` otherwise.
   - The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, such as `n` being zero or having leading zeros.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` calculates the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`, checking if the number meets the criteria using `func_1`.
   - If the number meets the criteria, it is added to the `total_sum`, and the sum is taken modulo `998244353`.
   - The function correctly handles the entire range `[l, r]` and ensures that no numbers outside this range are considered.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program reads the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` from the input.
   - It calls `func_2(l, r, k)` and prints the result.
   - Based on the descriptions and the provided states, both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and cover all necessary conditions.
   - There are no logical errors or missing parts in the functions.

Given the above analysis, the program is designed to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
