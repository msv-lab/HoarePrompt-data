Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a number has at most `k` unique digits, but the function `func_2` iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r` and sums those that satisfy this condition. However, the problem requires summing numbers that contain at most `k` different digits, not exactly `k` different digits. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `l = 10`, `r = 50`, `k = 2`

According to the problem description, we should sum numbers like `11`, `22`, `33`, `44`, `10`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `30`, `31`, `32`, `33`, `40`, `41`, `42`, `43`, `44`, `50`. 

However, the current implementation would also include numbers like `101`, `123`, etc., which do not meet the criteria since they have more than 2 different digits. Therefore, the program incorrectly includes numbers that should not be included in the sum.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should check if the number has at most `k` different digits, not exactly `k` different digits.
