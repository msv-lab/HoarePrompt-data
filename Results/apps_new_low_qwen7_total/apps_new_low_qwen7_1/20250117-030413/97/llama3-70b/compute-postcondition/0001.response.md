Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition:**
   - The only variable in the loop condition is `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1 (`x != 1`).

3. **Current state before the loop:**
   - `res` is `[x]`, where `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\).

4. **Determine the necessary condition for the loop to execute at least once:**
   - For the loop to execute even once, `x` must not be equal to 1 initially.

5. **Check the current state of `x`:**
   - Since `x` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq n\), it could be any value from 1 to \(n\).
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` should not be 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop must be modified so that `x` is not equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is `[x]`, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and `x` must not be equal to 1**
