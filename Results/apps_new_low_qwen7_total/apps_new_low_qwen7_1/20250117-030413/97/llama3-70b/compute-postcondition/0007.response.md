Let's analyze the given code and the provided states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
   - In each iteration, `x` is updated to `func_1(x)`.
   - The value of `x` is appended to the list `res`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - The variable `x` changes in each iteration according to `func_1(x)`.
   - The variable `res` accumulates the values of `x` at each step.
   - There are no other variables mentioned in the problem statement.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute until `x` becomes 1.
   - Each time the loop iterates, `x` is updated to `func_1(x)`, and this new value is added to `res`.
   - If `x` is initially a positive integer \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\), then `res` will contain the sequence of values obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` to `x` until it reaches 1.

4. **Determine the Final Output State**:
   - Since the loop continues to execute until `x` becomes 1, `res` will contain the sequence of values generated by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the initial value of `x`.
   - The last element in `res` will be 1, because the loop stops when `x` equals 1.
   - Therefore, `res` will be a list starting with the initial value of `x`, followed by subsequent values generated by `func_1(x)`, ending with 1.

### Verify Relationships
- The relationship described matches the pattern observed in the given output states.
- For example, if the loop executes 3 times, `res` is `[func_1(x), y, x, 1]`, where `y` is an intermediate value.

### Final Output State
The final output state after all executions of the loop will be a list that starts with the initial value of `x` and ends with 1, with each intermediate value being the result of applying `func_1` to the previous value.

Output State: **[initial_x, func_1(initial_x), func_1(func_1(initial_x)), ..., 1]**
