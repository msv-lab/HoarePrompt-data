Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and iteratively applies the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` reaches 1. It collects each intermediate value of `x` into a list `res`. The function then returns the list `res`, which contains the sequence of values obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` starting from `x` until `x` becomes 1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is already 1 when the function is called, the function will immediately return `[1]`.
- If `func_1` does not reduce `x` to 1 (i.e., `func_1` returns a value that never reaches 1), the function will continue to apply `func_1` indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop. This behavior is undefined and would need to be handled externally, possibly by setting a maximum number of iterations.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit check or limit on the number of iterations, which could lead to an infinite loop if `func_1` does not reduce `x` to 1. To handle this, one might consider adding a mechanism to stop the iteration after a certain number of steps or to raise an exception if `x` does not reach 1 within a reasonable number of iterations.
