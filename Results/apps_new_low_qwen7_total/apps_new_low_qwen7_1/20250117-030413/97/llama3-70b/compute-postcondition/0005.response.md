The loop condition in this case is `x != 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x` is not equal to 1. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is `res` is `[func_1(x), y, x]`.

To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `x`. For the loop to continue, `x` must not be equal to 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 1.

Since no other variables in the loop head affect the condition `x != 1`, we only need to adjust the state of `x`.

State: **`res` is `[func_1(x), y, x]` and `x` is not equal to 1**
