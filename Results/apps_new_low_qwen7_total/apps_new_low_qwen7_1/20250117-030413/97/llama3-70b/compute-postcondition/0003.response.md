The only variable in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\). For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\) but not equal to 1, meaning `x` should still be a positive integer between 1 and `n` excluding 1.

However, since `x` must not be equal to 1 for the loop to continue, the only way to ensure this is to keep `x` as a positive integer between 1 and `n` but ensuring it remains different from 1. The state of `y` does not affect the condition of the loop, so no adjustment is necessary for `y`.

State: **`res` is [x, y], x is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\), y is an integer**
