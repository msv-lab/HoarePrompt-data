Initial State: `res` is `[func_1(x), y, x]` and `x` is not equal to 1

The code snippet performs the following actions:
1. Assigns the result of `func_1(x)` to `x`.
2. Appends `x` (which now holds the result of `func_1(x)`) to the list `res`.

Let's break it down:

- Initially, `res` is `[func_1(x), y, x]`.
- After the first line `x = func_1(x)`, the value of `x` is updated to `func_1(x)`.
- In the second line, `res.append(x)` appends `func_1(x)` (the new value of `x`) to `res`, making `res` now `[func_1(x), y, x, func_1(x)]`.

Since `x` was initially `[func_1(x), y, x]` and `x` itself was updated to `func_1(x)`, the updated state of `res` is `[func_1(x), y, x, func_1(x)]`.

Output State: **res is [func_1(x), y, x, func_1(x)], x is func_1(x)**
