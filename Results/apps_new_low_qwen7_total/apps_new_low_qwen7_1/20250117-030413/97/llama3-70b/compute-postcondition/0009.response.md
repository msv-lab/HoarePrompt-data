The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\). After executing the function body, the function returns `res`, which is the last computed value of the function `func_1` applied iteratively starting from `initial_x` until it reaches 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `x` and return the result of iteratively applying the function `func_1` starting from `initial_x` until the value reaches 1.
