Initial State: `res` is `[x]`, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and `x` must not be equal to 1

Code Block:
```
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Let's break down the code execution:

1. The first line `x = func_1(x)` calls the function `func_1` with the current value of `x` as its argument. Since `x` is a positive integer between 1 and `n` (and not equal to 1), we don't know the exact value of `x` or the exact behavior of `func_1`, but we know it will return some integer value. Let's denote the return value of `func_1(x)` as `y`. After this line, `x` is now `y`.

2. The second line `res.append(x)` appends the new value of `x` (which is `y`) to the list `res`. So, `res` now contains the original value of `x` followed by the value returned by `func_1(x)`.

Given these steps, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **res is [x, y], x is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\), y is an integer**
