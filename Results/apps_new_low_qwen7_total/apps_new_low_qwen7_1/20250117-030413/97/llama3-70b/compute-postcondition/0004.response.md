Initial State: `res` is [x, y], where x is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\), and y is an integer

Code Block:
```
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Analysis:
- The first line calls a function `func_1` with the argument `x` and assigns the returned value back to `x`.
- The second line appends the new value of `x` to the list `res`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `x` after calling `func_1(x)`. However, we know that `x` will be a positive integer due to the precondition \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(x \neq 1\). After calling `func_1(x)`, the value of `x` will change to the result of `func_1(x)`.

The list `res` initially contains `[x, y]`. After executing the code block, `res` will contain `[func_1(x), y, x]` because `x` is appended to `res` after being updated by `func_1(x)`.

Output State: **res is [func_1(x), y, x]**
