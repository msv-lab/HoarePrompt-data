#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(x):
    if (x % 2 == 0) :
        return x // 2
        #The program returns x // 2, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and even
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns x - 1, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and x is not even
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` that is greater than or equal to 1. It checks if `x` is even. If `x` is even, the function returns `x // 2`. If `x` is not even, the function returns `x - 1`. The function ensures that the returned value is always either `x // 2` (when `x` is even) or `x - 1` (when `x` is odd). This transformation reduces the value of `x` while ensuring it remains an integer greater than or equal to 1. The function handles the case where `x` is 1, which is the smallest valid input, by returning 0 when `x` is even and 0 when `x` is odd, as `1 - 1` equals 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        
        res.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: [initial_x, func_1(initial_x), func_1(func_1(initial_x)), ..., 1]
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the last computed value of the function func_1 applied iteratively starting from initial_x until it reaches 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and iteratively applies the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` reaches 1. It collects each intermediate value of `x` into a list `res`. The function then returns the list `res`, which contains the sequence of values obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` starting from `x` until `x` becomes 1.
