The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` that is greater than or equal to 1. It checks if `x` is even. If `x` is even, the function returns `x // 2`. If `x` is not even, the function returns `x - 1`. The function ensures that the returned value is always either `x // 2` (when `x` is even) or `x - 1` (when `x` is odd). This transformation reduces the value of `x` while ensuring it remains an integer greater than or equal to 1. The function handles the case where `x` is 1, which is the smallest valid input, by returning 0 when `x` is even and 0 when `x` is odd, as `1 - 1` equals 0.
