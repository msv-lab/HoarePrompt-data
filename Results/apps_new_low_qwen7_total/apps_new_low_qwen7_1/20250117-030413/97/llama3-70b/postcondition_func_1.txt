The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and iteratively applies the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` reaches 1. It collects each intermediate value of `x` into a list `res`. The function then returns the list `res`, which contains the sequence of values obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` starting from `x` until `x` becomes 1.
