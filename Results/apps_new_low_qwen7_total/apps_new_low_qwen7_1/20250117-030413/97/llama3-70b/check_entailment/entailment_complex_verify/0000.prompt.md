You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
At first, let's define function $f(x)$ as follows: $$ \begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{x}{2} & \mbox{if } x \text{ is even} \\ x - 1 & \mbox{otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. \end{matrix} $$

We can see that if we choose some value $v$ and will apply function $f$ to it, then apply $f$ to $f(v)$, and so on, we'll eventually get $1$. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as $path(v)$. For example, $path(1) = [1]$, $path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1]$, $path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]$.

Let's write all lists $path(x)$ for every $x$ from $1$ to $n$. The question is next: what is the maximum value $y$ such that $y$ is contained in at least $k$ different lists $path(x)$?

Formally speaking, you need to find maximum $y$ such that $\left| \{ x ~|~ 1 \le x \le n, y \in path(x) \} \right| \ge k$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^{18}$).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the maximum value that is contained in at least $k$ paths.


-----Examples-----
Input
11 3

Output
5

Input
11 6

Output
4

Input
20 20

Output
1

Input
14 5

Output
6

Input
1000000 100

Output
31248



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $5$, since $5$ occurs in $path(5)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the second example, the answer is $4$, since $4$ occurs in $path(4)$, $path(5)$, $path(8)$, $path(9)$, $path(10)$ and $path(11)$.

In the third example $n = k$, so the answer is $1$, since $1$ is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from $1$ to $20$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return x // 2
    else:
        return x - 1

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        res.append(x)
    return res



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
count = {}
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in func_2(i):
        if j not in count:
            count[j] = 0
        count[j] += 1
max_y = 0
for (y, cnt) in count.items():
    if cnt >= k:
        max_y = max(max_y, y)
print(max_y)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(x):
    if (x % 2 == 0) :
        return x // 2
        #The program returns x // 2, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and even
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns x - 1, where x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and x is not even
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` that is greater than or equal to 1. It checks if `x` is even. If `x` is even, the function returns `x // 2`. If `x` is not even, the function returns `x - 1`. The function ensures that the returned value is always either `x // 2` (when `x` is even) or `x - 1` (when `x` is odd). This transformation reduces the value of `x` while ensuring it remains an integer greater than or equal to 1. The function handles the case where `x` is 1, which is the smallest valid input, by returning 0 when `x` is even and 0 when `x` is odd, as `1 - 1` equals 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        
        res.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: [initial_x, func_1(initial_x), func_1(func_1(initial_x)), ..., 1]
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the last computed value of the function func_1 applied iteratively starting from initial_x until it reaches 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (where \(1 \leq x \leq n\)) and iteratively applies the function `func_1` to `x` until `x` reaches 1. It collects each intermediate value of `x` into a list `res`. The function then returns the list `res`, which contains the sequence of values obtained by repeatedly applying `func_1` starting from `x` until `x` becomes 1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `func_2` function, which is required to generate the `path(x)` for a given `x`. The `func_2` function is supposed to generate a list containing all intermediate values of `x` as it is transformed by repeatedly applying `func_1` until `x` becomes 1. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly append the intermediate values to the result list. Specifically, the line `res.append(x)` should be outside the condition block, ensuring that `x` is appended after each transformation, not just when `x` is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        res.append(x)
    return res
```

This corrected function will ensure that all intermediate values are included in the list `res`, thus generating the correct `path(x)`. Without this correction, the program cannot accurately determine the maximum value that appears in at least `k` different paths, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
