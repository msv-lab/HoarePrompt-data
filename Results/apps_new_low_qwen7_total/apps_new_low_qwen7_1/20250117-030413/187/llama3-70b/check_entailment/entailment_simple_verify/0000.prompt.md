You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, ..., 2 * n}`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `n + m`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` must be non-negative, and `towers` contains `{2, 4, ..., 2 * n}` along with `{3 * i | i in range(1, m + 1)}`.
    print(max(towers))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers. It uses sets to ensure that no two students have the same number of blocks and calculates the maximum value among the generated tower heights. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples.
