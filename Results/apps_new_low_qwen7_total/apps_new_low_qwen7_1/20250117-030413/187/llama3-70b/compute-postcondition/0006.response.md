The code `towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is now 3, `i * 2` will be 6. The set `towers` initially contains {2, 4}. Adding 6 to the set will result in `{2, 4, 6}`.

### Updated Variables:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` must still be at least 1 and less than 3, so it must be either 1 or 2.
- `towers` now contains {2, 4, 6}.

### Output State:
**`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 1 and less than 3, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6}`
