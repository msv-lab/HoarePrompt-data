Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variables**: The loop is controlled by `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, m + 1)`.

2. **Initial state**: We are given that `i` is equal to `n` and `n` must be at least 1. This means `i = n`.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, m + 1)`. Since `i` is initialized to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` (which is `n`) is in the range `[1, m + 1)`.

4. **Constraints on `m`**: For `i` to be in the range `[1, m + 1)`, `i` must be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, `n < m + 1` or equivalently `n <= m`.

5. **Ensure `i` starts at 1**: The loop starts with `i = 1`, so `i` should be incremented from `1` onwards. Given `i` is initially set to `n`, `n` should be at least `1` and `m` should be at least `n`.

6. **State requirements**: The state before the loop should include:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be at least `1`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

Given the initial conditions and the constraints, the state must be:

**State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to `n`**.
