The given code snippet takes two non-negative integers `n` and `m` as input and splits them using `input().split()`. It then converts these inputs into integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. After that, it initializes a set named `towers`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can denote them as `n` and `m` respectively, where `0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`. The `towers` set remains empty.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000, n + m > 0, towers is a set()**
