The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some unspecified conditions involving non-negative integers `n` and `m` where 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.

However, since the specific conditions and return values are not provided in the given output, we can only state the constraints and the nature of the parameters.
