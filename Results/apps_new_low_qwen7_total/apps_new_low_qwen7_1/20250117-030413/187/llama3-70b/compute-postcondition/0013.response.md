`towers.add(i * 3)` adds the value of `i * 3` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially `n + 2`, `i * 3` becomes `(n + 2) * 3`. Therefore, the set `towers` now includes the values `n * 3`, `(n + 1) * 3`, and `(n + 2) * 3`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to `n + 2`, and `towers` contains `n * 3`, `(n + 1) * 3`, and `(n + 2) * 3`**
