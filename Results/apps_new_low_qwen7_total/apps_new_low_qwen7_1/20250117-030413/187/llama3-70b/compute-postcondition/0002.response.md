`towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i * 2` equals 2. Therefore, the set `towers` will now contain the number 2. The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it further.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `towers` is a set containing {2}**
