`i` is multiplied by 2 and added to the set `towers`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so `i * 2` equals 4. The set `towers` initially contains {2}, and after adding 4, it becomes {2, 4}. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1 and less than 3, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4}**
