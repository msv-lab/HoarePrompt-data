Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop control variable in the given `for` loop is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n+1` (exclusive).

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The initial condition provided is `0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000` and `n + m > 0`.
   - This means `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and their sum is greater than zero.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - Specifically, the first iteration happens when `i = 1`.

4. **Determine the State for the First Iteration:**
   - To enter the loop, `i` must be `1`.
   - The value of `n` must be such that `1` falls within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

Given these points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute the first time:

- `i` must be `1`.
- `n` must be at least `1` (since `i = 1` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
