The initial state is that `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\). The code reads four space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Then, it calculates `k` as `4 - n % 4`.

Let's consider the effect of the code on the variables:

1. The first line reads four integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The second line calculates `k` as `4 - n % 4`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of these variables. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, while `n` is updated to the new value read from input, and `k` is calculated based on `n`.

Output State: **n is the integer read from input, a is the integer read from input, b is the integer read from input, c is the integer read from input, k is 4 - n % 4**
