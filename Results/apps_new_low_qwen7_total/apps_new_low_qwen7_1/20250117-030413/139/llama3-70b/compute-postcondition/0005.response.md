To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input.
- If `k` equals 4, then `k` is 0.
- `ans` is infinity (which we can denote as `float('inf')` in Python).

### Loop:
```
for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` can be either the original value or 0, depending on the condition (`k` equals 4). Therefore, `k` can be either the original value of `k` (letâ€™s call it `k_original`) or 0.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `k // 3 + 1` is greater than 0.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `k // 3 + 1` must be 1, which means `k // 3` must be 0. This implies `k` must be between 0 (inclusive) and 3 (inclusive).
   
3. **Values of `k`:**
   - Since `k` can be either `k_original` or 0, we need to consider both cases.
     - If `k_original` is 0, the loop will execute.
     - If `k_original` is between 1 and 3, the loop will also execute because `k // 3 + 1` would still be 1.
     - If `k_original` is 4 or more, the loop will not execute because `k // 3 + 1` would be greater than 1.
     - If `k_original` is 0, the loop will execute because `0 // 3 + 1 = 1`.

4. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be between 0 and 3 inclusive.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be between 0 and 3 inclusive.

### Final State:
State: **`k` must be between 0 and 3 inclusive**.

This ensures that `k // 3 + 1` evaluates to 1, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
