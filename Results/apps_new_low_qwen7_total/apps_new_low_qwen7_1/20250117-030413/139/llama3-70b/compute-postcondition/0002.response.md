The initial value of `k` is 4, and the code snippet sets `k` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `c` is an integer read from input, `k` is 0**
