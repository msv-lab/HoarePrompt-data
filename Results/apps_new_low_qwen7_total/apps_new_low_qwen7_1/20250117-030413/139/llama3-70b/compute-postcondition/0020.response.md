The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned but are not passed as arguments to the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` without accepting them as parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` without passing them as arguments.**
