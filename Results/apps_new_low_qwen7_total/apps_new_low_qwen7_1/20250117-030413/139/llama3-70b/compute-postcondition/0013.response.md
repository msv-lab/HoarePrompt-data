Postcondition: ***`k` is between 0 and 3 inclusive; `i` is \(i + 1\); `j` is \(\frac{k - 3i - 3}{2}\); `ans` is the minimum of its current value and \(3i * c + 3c + \frac{k - 3i - 3}{2} * b\). This is because if \(3i + 2j \leq k\), then `ans` is updated to the specified value. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.***
