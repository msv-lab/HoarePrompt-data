The initial state is that `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, and if `k` equals 4, then `k` is 0. The code sets `ans` to `float('inf')`.

The code does not affect `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `k`. It only initializes `ans` to `float('inf')`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input, if `k` equals 4, then `k` is 0; `ans` is infinity.**
