Postcondition: **`k` is between 0 and 3 inclusive; `j` is either -3 * i // 2, (1 - 3 * i) // 2, (2 - 3 * i) // 2, or (3 - 3 * i) // 2, depending on the value of `k` and `i`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the expression `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`, and the condition `3 * i + 2 * j <= k` holds true.**
