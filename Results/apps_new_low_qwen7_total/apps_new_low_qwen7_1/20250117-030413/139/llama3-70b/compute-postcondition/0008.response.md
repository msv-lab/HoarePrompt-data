`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the expression `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified, and the expressions involving `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on each other. Since `k` is between 0 and 3 inclusive, and `j` is determined by `k` and `i`, the value of `3 * i + 2 * j` being less than or equal to `k` ensures that the relationship holds true.

Given the dependency and without a specific initial value for `ans`, the expression `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a` will be calculated and compared with `ans`. After this comparison, `ans` will hold the smaller of its original value and the new calculated value.

Output State: **`k` is between 0 and 3 inclusive; `j` is either -3 * i // 2, (1 - 3 * i) // 2, (2 - 3 * i) // 2, or (3 - 3 * i) // 2, depending on the value of `k` and `i`; the current value of `3 * i + 2 * j` is less than or equal to `k`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the expression `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`**
