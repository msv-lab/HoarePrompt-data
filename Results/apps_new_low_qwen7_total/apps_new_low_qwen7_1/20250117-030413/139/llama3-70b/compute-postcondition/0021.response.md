Functionality: **The function reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9 \). It then calculates the value of \( k \) as \( 4 - n \mod 4 \), ensuring \( k \) is between 0 and 3 inclusive. The function iterates over possible values of \( i \) and \( j \) derived from \( k \), computing the expression \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \) and updating the minimum value found in \( ans \). Finally, it prints the minimum value of the expression obtained. This process covers all possible values of \( k \) and ensures that \( 3i + 2j \leq k \).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n \) is a multiple of 4, \( k \) will be 0.
- If \( k \) is 0, the loop will not execute, and \( ans \) will remain as its initial value of infinity, which means the output will be infinity.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no handling for invalid input types or out-of-range values for \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The code assumes valid input without any validation checks.
