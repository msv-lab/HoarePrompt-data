You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, b, c are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

k = 4 - n % 4
    if (k == 4) :
        k = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers read from input. If `k` equals 4, then `k` is 0. Since there is no else part, the value of `k` remains unchanged (i.e., `k` will be `4 - n % 4`).
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is between 0 and the original value of `k` inclusive; `i` is `k // 3`; `j` is `(k - 3 * (k // 3)) // 2` or `0` depending on the exact value of `k`; `ans` is the minimum value of `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a` for all valid `i` and `j` as described in the loop.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9 \). It then calculates the value of \( k \) as \( 4 - n \mod 4 \), ensuring \( k \) is between 0 and 3 inclusive. The function iterates over possible values of \( i \) and \( j \) derived from \( k \), computing the expression \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \) and updating the minimum value found in \( ans \). Finally, it prints the minimum value of the expression obtained. This process covers all possible values of \( k \) and ensures that \( 3i + 2j \leq k \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Alyona to have a number of copybooks that is divisible by 4. The logic for determining the minimum number of additional copybooks needed (`k`) and then calculating the cost based on the types of packs available seems sound. The nested loops ensure that all combinations of packs are considered, and the minimum cost is found. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various scenarios appropriately without any apparent flaws.
