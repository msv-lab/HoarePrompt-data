You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9 \). It then calculates the value of \( k \) as \( 4 - n \mod 4 \), ensuring \( k \) is between 0 and 3 inclusive. The function iterates over possible values of \( i \) and \( j \) derived from \( k \), computing the expression \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \) and updating the minimum value found in \( ans \). Finally, it prints the minimum value of the expression obtained. This process covers all possible values of \( k \) and ensures that \( 3i + 2j \leq k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost for Alyona to buy enough copybooks such that the total number of copybooks she has is divisible by 4. The cost is calculated based on the types of packs available (1 copybook for `a` rubles, 2 for `b` rubles, and 3 for `c` rubles).

2. **Calculation of Required Copybooks (`k`)**: 
   - `k = 4 - n % 4` calculates how many more copybooks are needed to make the total number of copybooks a multiple of 4.
   - If `k` is already 4, no additional copybooks are needed, so `k` is set to 0.

3. **Optimal Purchase Strategy**:
   - We iterate through all possible combinations of packs to minimize the cost.
   - For each combination of packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks, we calculate the cost and update the minimum cost.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k // 3 + 1):` ensures we consider all possible combinations where the number of packs of 3 copybooks ranges from 0 to `k // 3`.
   - Inside this loop, `j = (k - 3 * i) // 2` calculates the number of packs of 2 copybooks.
   - The condition `if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:` ensures that the total number of copybooks bought matches `k`.
   - The cost calculation `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a` accounts for the cost of the packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks respectively.
   - `ans = min(ans, ...)` updates the minimum cost found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case when `k` is exactly 4 by setting it to 0, avoiding unnecessary calculations.

Given the logic and the implementation, the provided solution appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Alyona to achieve her goal.
