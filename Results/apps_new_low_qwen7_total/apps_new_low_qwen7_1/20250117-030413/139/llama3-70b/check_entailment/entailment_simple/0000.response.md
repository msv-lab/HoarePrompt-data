Reasoning:
1. The program correctly calculates the remainder `k` when `n` is divided by 4 using the expression `k = 4 - n % 4`. This determines how many additional copybooks are needed to make the total number of copybooks divisible by 4.
2. The program then initializes `ans` with infinity, which ensures that any calculated cost will be lower.
3. A nested loop iterates over possible combinations of buying packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the minimum cost. The loop variables `i` and `j` represent the number of packs of 3 and 2 copybooks, respectively.
4. The condition `3 * i + 2 * j <= k` ensures that the total number of additional copybooks does not exceed `k`.
5. For each valid combination of `i` and `j`, the cost is calculated as `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a`, and the minimum cost is updated accordingly.
6. Finally, the minimum cost is printed.

The program logic follows the problem requirements and correctly computes the minimum cost to achieve the goal of making the total number of copybooks divisible by 4.
