Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Alyona to have a number of copybooks that is divisible by 4. The logic for determining the minimum number of additional copybooks needed (`k`) and then calculating the cost based on the types of packs available seems sound. The nested loops ensure that all combinations of packs are considered, and the minimum cost is found. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various scenarios appropriately without any apparent flaws.
