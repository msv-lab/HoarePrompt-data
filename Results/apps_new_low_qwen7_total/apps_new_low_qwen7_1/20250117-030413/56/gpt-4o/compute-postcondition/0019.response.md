Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\),
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\),
- `bits` is a list containing all indices of the set bits of `n` in descending order from 60 to 0,
- the length of `bits` is less than `k`.

Let's analyze the code snippet:
```python
smallest = bits.pop()
bits.append(smallest - 1)
bits.append(smallest - 1)
```

1. **First Line:** `smallest = bits.pop()`
   - This line pops the last element from the `bits` list and assigns it to `smallest`. Let's denote the last element of `bits` before popping as `b`. So, `smallest = b`.

2. **Second Line:** `bits.append(smallest - 1)`
   - This line appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. Since `smallest` is `b`, this appends `b - 1` to `bits`.

3. **Third Line:** `bits.append(smallest - 1)`
   - This line again appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. Again, since `smallest` is `b`, this appends `b - 1` to `bits` once more.

After these operations, the `bits` list will have one less element than before (since we popped an element) and two additional elements, both being `b - 1`.

Final Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), bits is a list containing all indices of the set bits of n in descending order from 60 to 0 with the last element replaced by b-1 and two occurrences of b-1 appended, where b was the last element of the original bits list**.
