The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. Given the initial state, `i` is 60, and `bits` is an empty list. After executing `bits.append(i)`, the value of `bits` will be a list containing the single element `60`.

The condition `(n >> i & 1)` being 1 means that the i-th bit of `n` is set (i.e., it is 1). However, this condition does not affect the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k ≤ n, `bits` is a list containing `[60]`, and `(n >> 60 & 1)` is 1.**
