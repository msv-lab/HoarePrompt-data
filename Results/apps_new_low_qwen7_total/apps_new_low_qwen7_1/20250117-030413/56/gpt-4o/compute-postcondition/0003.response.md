The code initializes an empty list named `bits`. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables `n` and `k`, but it does create the new list `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n; `bits` is an empty list**
