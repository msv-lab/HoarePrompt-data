Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices of the set bits of `n` in descending order from 60 to 0, and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`***
