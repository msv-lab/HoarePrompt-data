Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is currently 59.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
   - `bits` is a list.
   - If \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, then `bits` contains `[60]`. Otherwise, `bits` contains `[59]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 60 to -1 (inclusive) with a step of -1.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The current value of `i` is 59.
   - Since the loop is iterating from 60 down to 0, the next value of `i` will be 58.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect its new value after the next iteration.
   - `n`, `k`, and `bits` are not directly modified within the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
- `i` will be 58.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` remains a list containing `[60]` if \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, or `[59]` otherwise.

State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing `[60]` if \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, or `[59]` otherwise.**
