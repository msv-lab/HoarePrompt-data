Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k ≤ n, bits is a list with length exactly k + 3**

Explanation:
- The first line `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element of the `bits` list and assigns it to `smallest`. This reduces the length of `bits` by one.
- The second line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` adds `smallest - 1` to the end of the `bits` list, increasing its length by one.
- The third line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` again adds `smallest - 1` to the end of the `bits` list, further increasing its length by one.

After these operations, the length of `bits` is increased from `k + 1` to `k + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
