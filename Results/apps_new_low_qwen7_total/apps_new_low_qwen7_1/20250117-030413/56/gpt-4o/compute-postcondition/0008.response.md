Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 60
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is a list. If \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, then `bits` contains `[60]`. Otherwise, `bits` remains an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 60 and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `bits`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change within the loop itself based on the given information.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 60 and decreases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 59.
   - The conditions for `n`, `k`, and `bits` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 59, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list. If \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, then `bits` contains `[60]`. Otherwise, `bits` remains an empty list.**
