The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).

The function returns either:
- Case_1: 'No'
- Case_2: 'No'
- Case_3: 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of integers contained in the list `bits`, which is sorted in descending order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return either 'No', 'No', or 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of integers from the list `bits` sorted in descending order.
