`bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits`. Initially, `bits` contains `[60]` if \((n >> 60 & 1)\) is 1, or `[59]` otherwise. Since `bits` initially contains one element, the value of \((n >> 60 & 1)\) does not affect the current content of `bits`. After appending `i`, the list `bits` will contain both elements.

Output State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing `[60, 58]` if \((n >> 60 & 1)\) was 1, or `[59, 58]` otherwise.**
