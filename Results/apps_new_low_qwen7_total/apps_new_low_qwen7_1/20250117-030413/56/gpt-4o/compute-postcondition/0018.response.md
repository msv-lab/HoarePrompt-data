Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute for the first time.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` is a list containing all indices of the set bits of `n` in descending order from 60 to 0.
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.

The loop condition is:
```
while len(bits) < k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `len(bits) < k` must be true. This means that the length of `bits` must be less than `k`.

Right before the loop, we know:
- `bits` is a list containing indices of set bits of `n`.
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the length of `bits` must be strictly less than `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

Since `k` is a positive integer and `bits` contains indices of set bits of `n`, the maximum length of `bits` can be up to 61 (if `n` has all 61 bits set). However, given the constraints, the length of `bits` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `k` initially. To ensure the loop executes, `len(bits)` should be less than `k`.

Thus, the only state change required is to ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices of the set bits of `n` in descending order from 60 to 0, and the length of `bits` is less than `k`**.
