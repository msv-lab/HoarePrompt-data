Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is an empty list

### Loop Details
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 (inclusive) in steps of -1. This means `i` will take values from 60 down to 0.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range of the loop definition. Therefore, `i` should be 60 at the start of the first iteration.

2. **Variables `n`, `k`, and `bits`:**
   - These variables are not directly used in the loop itself. They are not modified within the loop, so their values before the loop start remain unchanged during the loop execution.
   - Since no assumptions about the loop body can be made, we only need to ensure that the loop can start based on the value of `i`.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute the first time, the value of `i` must be 60. The values of `n`, `k`, and `bits` do not need to change to allow the loop to start, but they must be as given in the initial state.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k ≤ n, `bits` is an empty list**
