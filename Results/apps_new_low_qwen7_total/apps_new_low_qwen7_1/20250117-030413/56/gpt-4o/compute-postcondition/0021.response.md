Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list with length exactly \(k - 1\)

Code Snippet:
```
smallest = bits.pop()
bits.append(smallest - 1)
bits.append(smallest - 1)
```

Analysis:
- The first line pops the smallest element from the `bits` list and stores it in the variable `smallest`.
- The second line appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list.
- The third line also appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list.

After the code execution, the length of the `bits` list increases by two because two elements (`smallest - 1`) are appended to it. The value of `smallest` is no longer stored in a variable but was used to modify the `bits` list.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), bits is a list with length exactly \(k + 2\) where the last two elements are `smallest - 1` and `smallest - 1`, and the rest of the elements are the remaining elements from the original `bits` list**.
