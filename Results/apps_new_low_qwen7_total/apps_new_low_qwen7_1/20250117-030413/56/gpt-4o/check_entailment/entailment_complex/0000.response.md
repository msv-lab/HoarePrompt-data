Reasoning:
The annotated program logic needs to be carefully analyzed against the problem requirements. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and passes it to `func_1`.

2. **Binary Representation Analysis**: 
   - The function checks if the number of set bits (`len(bits)`) is greater than `k`. If true, it returns 'No'.
   - If the number of set bits is less than or equal to `k`, it proceeds to ensure that the list `bits` has exactly `k` elements by appending decremented values to it until its length is `k`.
   - This part handles the case where `n` is not fully decomposed into `k` terms.

3. **Decrement Operation**: 
   - The decrement operation ensures that the largest number in the resulting sequence is minimized, and the sequence is lexicographically largest.
   - For example, if `n` is `23` and `k` is `5`, the initial bits are `[3, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and the function correctly modifies it to ensure the largest number is minimal while keeping the sequence lexicographically largest.

4. **Sorting and Output**: 
   - The list `bits` is sorted in reverse (descending) order, ensuring the lexicographically largest sequence is produced.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes' followed by the constructed sequence.

However, there are a couple of potential issues:
- The function should handle the case where `n` is a power of 2, which means `n` has only one set bit. If `k` is 1, it should return the correct answer, and if `k` is greater than 1, it should return 'No'.
- The current implementation might produce incorrect results if `k` is greater than the number of set bits in `n` and the decrement operation results in invalid indices (e.g., negative indices).

Given the edge cases and the overall logic, the provided program seems to address most of the requirements, including handling the decrement operation and producing the lexicographically largest sequence.
