### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The initial check `if (k > n) : return 'No'` ensures that the problem's constraints are met, as it is impossible to represent a number \( n \) with \( k \) or fewer terms if \( k > n \). This is correct.

2. **Bit Representation**: The program correctly extracts the binary representation of \( n \) by checking each bit position from 60 down to 0 (`for i in range(60, -1, -1)`). It appends the positions of the set bits to the `bits` list. This part is accurate.

3. **Length Check**: The check `if (len(bits) > k) : return 'No'` ensures that the number of bits required to represent \( n \) does not exceed \( k \). If it does, the function returns 'No'. This is correct.

4. **Extension of Bits**: The while loop `while len(bits) < k:` ensures that the `bits` list reaches the required length \( k \). It does this by decrementing the smallest bit found in the `bits` list and appending it twice. This logic is designed to minimize the largest bit while ensuring the list length is \( k \).

5. **Sorting and Output**: The final step sorts the `bits` list in reverse (descending) order to make the sequence lexicographically largest. Then it returns 'Yes' followed by the space-separated list of integers.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program appears to be sound. It correctly handles the constraints and generates the appropriate output based on the given problem statement. The algorithm ensures that the sequence is both minimal and lexicographically largest by incrementally adding smaller bits when necessary.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed steps and checks within the program, it accurately implements the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:

**True**
