Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

### Analysis of the Problem Description and Input/Output

The problem requires finding `k` integers such that their corresponding powers of 2 sum up to `n`, with the largest integer minimized and the sequence lexicographically maximized. The function `func_1` is designed to handle this problem.

### Detailed Function Analysis

#### Initial Check (`if k > n:`)
- This check ensures that `k` cannot be greater than `n` since the maximum sum of `k` powers of 2 cannot exceed `k * 2^0 = k`.

#### Bit Manipulation (`for i in range(60, -1, -1):`)
- This loop iterates through the bits of `n` in descending order (from 60 down to 0).
- If the bit at position `i` is set (i.e., `n >> i & 1`), it adds `i` to the `bits` list.

#### Length Check (`if len(bits) > k:`)
- This check ensures that the number of set bits does not exceed `k`. If it does, it returns `'No'`.

#### Handling Insufficient Bits (`while len(bits) < k:`)
- If the number of set bits is less than `k`, it repeatedly appends the decremented values of the smallest bit index until the length of `bits` is exactly `k`.

#### Sorting and Returning Result (`bits.sort(reverse=True)` and `'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))`)
- The `bits` list is sorted in descending order.
- The function returns 'Yes' followed by the space-separated string of the elements in `bits`.

### Testing and Validation

1. **Case `n = 23` and `k = 5`:**
   - Binary representation of `23` is `10111`.
   - Set bits are at positions `[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
   - The function returns `['4', '3', '2', '1', '0']`, which is correct.

2. **Case `n = 13` and `k = 2`:**
   - Binary representation of `13` is `1101`.
   - Set bits are at positions `[3, 2, 0]`.
   - Since we need exactly `2` elements, we append the smallest bit `0` twice.
   - The function returns `'No'`, which is incorrect as per the problem statement, but the logic is sound for the constraints given.

3. **Case `n = 1` and `k = 2`:**
   - Binary representation of `1` is `1`.
   - Set bit is at position `[0]`.
   - We need `2` elements, so we append `-1` twice.
   - The function returns `'Yes -1 -1'`, which is correct.

4. **Case `n = 8` and `k = 3`:**
   - Binary representation of `8` is `1000`.
   - Set bit is at position `[3]`.
   - We need `3` elements, so we append `-1` twice and `3`.
   - The function returns `'Yes 3 -1 -1'`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

- The function correctly handles the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is greater than the number of bits needed to represent `n`. For example, when `n = 8` and `k = 3`, the function returns `'Yes 3 -1 -1'`, which is correct.
- The function also correctly handles the case when `k` is greater than the number of set bits in `n` by appending `-1` until the length of `bits` is `k`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was accurate. The function indeed has an issue with handling the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is greater than the number of bits needed to represent `n`. However, the provided examples and edge cases confirm that the function works correctly in most scenarios.

Final: **False**
