Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is greater than the number of bits needed to represent `n`. Specifically, for inputs like `n = 8` and `k = 3`, the program should output `Yes` and `[3, 2, 1]`, but instead, it outputs `'No'`.

This can be seen from the logic in `func_1` where it checks if `len(bits) > k` and returns `'No'` immediately without considering if the bits can still form a valid sequence by adjusting the values. This logic is incomplete and leads to incorrect results in certain cases.
