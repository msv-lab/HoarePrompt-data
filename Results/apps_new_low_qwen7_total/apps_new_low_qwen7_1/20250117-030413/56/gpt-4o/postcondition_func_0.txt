The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It checks if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If the number of set bits is greater than `k`, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `bits` containing the indices of the set bits of `n` in descending order. Then, if the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it repeatedly appends the decremented values of the smallest bit index until the length of `bits` is exactly `k`. Finally, it sorts `bits` in descending order and returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of the elements in `bits`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 'No' because there are no set bits.
- If `k` is greater than the number of set bits in `n`, the function will still append decremented values to `bits` until its length reaches `k`, even though these values are not indices of set bits in `n`.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2. In such cases, the binary representation of `n` has only one set bit, and the function should correctly determine if this single bit is within the range specified by `k`. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this scenario.
