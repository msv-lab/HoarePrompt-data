You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters, with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is `n // 2`. The function returns `False` if any character at position `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`) is not equal to the corresponding character at position `n - 1 - i`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop checks each pair of characters symmetrically around the center of the string. It starts from the first and last characters and moves towards the center.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n // 2 - 1`.
    #   - `s` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
    #   - If any pair of characters `s[i]` and `s[n - 1 - i]` is not equal, the function immediately returns `False` and stops executing further iterations.
    #   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all pairs of characters symmetrically around the center are equal, so the function returns `True`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: 
    #   - The loop will execute `n // 2` times if `n` is even, or `(n // 2) + 1` times if `n` is odd.
    #   - The function returns `True` only if the string is a palindrome, meaning all characters are equal when read from both ends.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the string `s` is a palindrome, meaning all characters from the start to the end are equal when read from both ends; otherwise, it returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" by comparing characters from the start and the end towards the center of the string. This logic is correct for determining if a string is symmetric about its middle. The function `func_1` iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding mirrored character in the second half. If all characters match, the function returns `True`, indicating the string is an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Since the function correctly implements the logic for checking if a string is "s-palindrome," it should work correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every case.
