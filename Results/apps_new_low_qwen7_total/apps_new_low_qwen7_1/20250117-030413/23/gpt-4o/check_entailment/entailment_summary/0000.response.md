Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given string is an "s-palindrome". The function `func_1` accurately checks whether the string is symmetric around its center by comparing characters from both ends towards the center. Given that the problem definition matches the function's implementation, and the execution summary accurately describes the function's behavior, the program should work as intended for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
