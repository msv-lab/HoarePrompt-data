You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

- Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive. It checks whether the string is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from both ends. If any pair of symmetric characters is not equal, the function returns `False`. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns `True`. The function covers all edge cases where the string is a palindrome or not, including strings of odd and even lengths.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided Python program checks if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" as defined in the problem statement. Here's how the code works:

1. The program reads a string `s` from the input.
2. It calls a function `func_1(s)` to check if the string is an "s-palindrome".
3. The function `func_1(s)`:
   - Computes the length of the string `n`.
   - Iterates through the first half of the string (`range(n // 2)`).
   - Compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string (`s[i]` vs `s[n - 1 - i]`).
   - If any pair of characters do not match, it returns `False`.
   - If all pairs match, it returns `True`.

Given this logic, the program correctly determines whether the string is an "s-palindrome" based on the definition provided. Since the function `func_1` accurately checks for the symmetry required for an "s-palindrome", the main logic in the program will also produce the correct output ("TAK" for "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise).

Correctness: **True**
