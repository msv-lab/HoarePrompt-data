Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" by comparing characters from the start and the end towards the center of the string. This logic is correct for determining if a string is symmetric about its middle. The function `func_1` iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding mirrored character in the second half. If all characters match, the function returns `True`, indicating the string is an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Since the function correctly implements the logic for checking if a string is "s-palindrome," it should work correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every case.
