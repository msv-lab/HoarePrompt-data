Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

# Annotated Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters, with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is `n // 2`. The function returns `False` if any character at position `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`) is not equal to the corresponding character at position `n - 1 - i`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`.

    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop checks each pair of characters symmetrically around the center of the string. It starts from the first and last characters and moves towards the center.
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n // 2 - 1`.
    #   - `s` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
    #   - If any pair of characters `s[i]` and `s[n - 1 - i]` is not equal, the function immediately returns `False` and stops executing further iterations.
    #   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all pairs of characters symmetrically around the center are equal, so the function returns `True`.
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: 
    #   - The loop will execute `n // 2` times if `n` is even, or `(n // 2) + 1` times if `n` is odd.
    #   - The function returns `True` only if the string is a palindrome, meaning all characters are equal when read from both ends.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the string `s` is a palindrome, meaning all characters from the start to the end are equal when read from both ends; otherwise, it returns False
