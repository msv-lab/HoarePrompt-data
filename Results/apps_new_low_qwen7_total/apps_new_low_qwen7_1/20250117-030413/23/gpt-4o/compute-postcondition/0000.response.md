The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the value of `n` will be a positive integer within this range. The state of the string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`.**
