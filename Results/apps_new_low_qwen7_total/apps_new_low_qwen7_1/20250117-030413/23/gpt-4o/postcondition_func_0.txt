The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive. It checks whether the string is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from both ends. If any pair of symmetric characters is not equal, the function returns `False`. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns `True`. The function covers all edge cases where the string is a palindrome or not, including strings of odd and even lengths.
