Reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly and splits it into the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to calculate the minimum time needed to prepare at least `n` potions using the given spells.
3. The logic in `func_1` checks the following scenarios:
   - Using only a spell of the second type.
   - Using only a spell of the first type.
   - Using both a spell of the first type and a spell of the second type.
4. For each scenario, it calculates the time required to prepare the remaining potions after accounting for the potions instantly created by the second type spell or the reduction in preparation time from the first type spell.
5. The function updates the `min_time` variable with the minimum time found across all scenarios.
6. The logic in the loops seems to cover all the necessary conditions and constraints provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the solution correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
