Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`, and it ranges from `0` to `k-1`. The loop head does not specify any other variables directly, but we need to consider the implications of the loop on the other variables.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value that is less than `k`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `k`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration:
- `d[j]` is an integer,
- `remaining_manapoints` is an integer,
- `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer,
- `time_with_both_spells` is a non-negative integer,
- `min_time` is a non-negative integer,

And considering the condition for the next iteration:
- `j` must be incremented by 1,
- `j` must still be less than `k`.

Since `j` is the only variable explicitly controlled by the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`d[j]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is a non-negative integer, `min_time` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`**. 

So, the final state is:
State: **`d[j+1]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is a non-negative integer, `min_time` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `j+1` and `j` must be less than `k`**.
