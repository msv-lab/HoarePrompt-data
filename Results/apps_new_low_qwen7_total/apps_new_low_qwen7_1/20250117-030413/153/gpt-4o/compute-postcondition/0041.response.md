Postcondition: ***`i` is `m-1`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, and `d` are unchanged, and `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[m-1] - sum(d[j] for j in range(k) where d[j] <= remaining_manapoints)`, provided that `b[i] <= s`. If `b[i] > s`, `min_time` remains unchanged.***
