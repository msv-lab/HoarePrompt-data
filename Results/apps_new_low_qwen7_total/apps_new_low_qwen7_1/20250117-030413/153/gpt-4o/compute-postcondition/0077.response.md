Postcondition: ***`i` is `m + 1`, `b[m-1]` remains unchanged, `min_time` remains unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged, `j` is `k + 1`. If for any `j` in the range `[k+1, m]`, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]`. If no such `j` is found, `min_time` remains unchanged.***
