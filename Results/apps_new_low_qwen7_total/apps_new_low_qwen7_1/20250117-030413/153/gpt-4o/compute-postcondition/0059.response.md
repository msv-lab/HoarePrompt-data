Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` are unchanged. If `b[i] <= s`, the loop breaks at the last iteration index `j` which is less than `k`, and `j` is the largest index such that `d[j] <= remaining_manapoints`. If `b[i] > s`, `min_time` remains unchanged.***
