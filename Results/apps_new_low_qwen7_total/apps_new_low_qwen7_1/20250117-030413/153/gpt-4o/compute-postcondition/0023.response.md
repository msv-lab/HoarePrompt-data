Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial values of the variables are as follows:
   - `i` is `m-1`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `min_time` are unchanged from their initial values.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` using `range(m)`. This means `i` will take the values from `m-1` down to `0`.

3. **First Iteration**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to `m-1`.

4. **Checking the Condition Inside the Loop**: We need to check the condition inside the loop to determine if `min_time` should be updated.
   - The condition is `if b[i] <= s:`.
   - Since `i` is initially `m-1`, we need to evaluate `b[m-1]` against `s`.

5. **Update Condition**: If `b[m-1]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the original `min_time` and `n * a[m-1]`. Otherwise, `min_time` remains unchanged.

6. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**: For the loop to execute, `i` must start at `m-1` and decrease until it reaches `0`.

Given the above points, the key variables that control the loop execution are `i`, `m`, `b`, `s`, and `min_time`.

### Final State:
- `i` must be `m-1` for the loop to start.
- `b[m-1]` must be less than or equal to `s` for `min_time` to be updated.
- `min_time` must be such that it allows the update condition to be evaluated correctly (i.e., it must be a valid value).

Therefore, the state must be:

**State: **`i` is `m-1`, `b[m-1]` is less than or equal to `s`, `min_time` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are unchanged**
