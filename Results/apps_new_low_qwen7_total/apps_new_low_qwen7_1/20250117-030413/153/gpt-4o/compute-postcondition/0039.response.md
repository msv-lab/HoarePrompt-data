Postcondition: ***`d[j+1]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is a non-negative integer, `min_time` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `j+2`, and `j` must be less than `k`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])` and `time_with_both_spells` is set to `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.***
