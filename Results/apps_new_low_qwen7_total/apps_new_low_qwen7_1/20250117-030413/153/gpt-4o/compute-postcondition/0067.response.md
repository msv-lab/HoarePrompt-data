Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 1`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` are unchanged, and depending on the condition `d[j] <= remaining_manapoints`, either `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])` and `time_with_both_spells` is set to `remaining_potions * a[i]`, or the loop breaks out without further changes to these variables.**
