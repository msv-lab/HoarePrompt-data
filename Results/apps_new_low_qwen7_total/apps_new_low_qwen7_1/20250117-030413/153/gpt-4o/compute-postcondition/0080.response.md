The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
- `m`: an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `k`: an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5.
- `x`: an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9.
- `s`: an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9.
- `a`: a list of m integers where 1 ≤ a_i < x.
- `b`: a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 2·10^9.
- `c`: a list of k integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and c_i are non-decreasing.
- `d`: a list of k integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2·10^9 and d_i are non-decreasing.

After executing the function body, the function returns `min_time`, which is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the entire loop execution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept specified integer parameters and a list of integers, and return the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the execution of the function.
