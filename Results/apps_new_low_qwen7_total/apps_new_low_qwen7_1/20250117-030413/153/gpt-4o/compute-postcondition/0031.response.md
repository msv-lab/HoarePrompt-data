Postcondition: ***`d[j]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is a non-negative integer, and `min_time` is a non-negative integer. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `d[j]` is added to `remaining_potions`, and `time_with_both_spells` is updated accordingly. If `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, the innermost loop or structure is exited.***
