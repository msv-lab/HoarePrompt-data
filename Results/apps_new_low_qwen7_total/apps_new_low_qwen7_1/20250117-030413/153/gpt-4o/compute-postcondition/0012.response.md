To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and the conditions required for the loop to start.

Given the initial state:
- `min_time` is the minimum value of `remaining_potions * x` for all valid `i` (where `d[i] <= s`).
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain in their initial states.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[0, m-1]`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The variable `min_time` is already defined and holds a specific value based on the initial conditions (the minimum value of `remaining_potions * x` for all valid `i` where `d[i] <= s`).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is `0` and continue as long as `i < m`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) are assumed to remain in their initial states, and they do not affect the loop's starting condition directly.

Based on the above reasoning, for the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `i` must be `0`.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` must remain in their initial states.
- The value of `min_time` is irrelevant for the loop's first execution.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` must remain in their initial states**
