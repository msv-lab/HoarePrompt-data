Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- The loop variable `j` starts from `m + 1` and is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`.
- If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`.
- The loop breaks out of the iteration if `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`.

### Loop Head:
The loop variable in this case is `j`. The other variables (`b`, `min_time`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints`) remain unchanged unless explicitly mentioned to be modified within the loop.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `m + 1`
- `b[m-1]` remains unchanged
- `min_time` remains unchanged
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged
- `j` is incremented by 1

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Initially, `j = m + 1`.
   - After the first iteration, `j = m + 2`.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `m + 2` (if it hasn't broken out yet).

3. **Variables to Adjust:**
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to `m + 2` for the next iteration.
   - No other variables change unless they are modified within the loop body, but based on the problem description, they remain unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `i` is `m + 1` (unchanged)
- `b[m-1]` remains unchanged
- `min_time` remains unchanged
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged
- `j` is now `m + 2`

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `b[m-1]` remains unchanged, `min_time` remains unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged, `j` is `m + 2`**
