Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the updated minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` are unchanged, and `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])` and `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
