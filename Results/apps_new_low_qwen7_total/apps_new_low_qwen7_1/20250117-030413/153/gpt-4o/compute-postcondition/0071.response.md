Postcondition: ***`i` is `m + 1`, `b[m-1]` remains unchanged, `min_time` remains unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the loop breaks out of the iteration.***
