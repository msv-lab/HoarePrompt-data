The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `k` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
