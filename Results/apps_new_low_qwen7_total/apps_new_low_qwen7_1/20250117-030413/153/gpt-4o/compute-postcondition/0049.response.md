Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the updated minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d` and `remaining_manapoints` are unchanged, and `j` is 0. This is true whether `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints` or not.***

In this case, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the condition in the if statement because the else part has the same postcondition as the if part. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of either part, as they are identical.
