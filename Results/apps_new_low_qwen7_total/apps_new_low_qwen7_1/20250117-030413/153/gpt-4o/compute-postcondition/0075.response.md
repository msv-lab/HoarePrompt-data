Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 1`, `b[m-1]` remains unchanged, `min_time` remains unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `remaining_manapoints` remain unchanged, `j` is `m + 2`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])` and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between `min_time` and `(max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])`. Otherwise, `remaining_potions` remains unchanged.**
