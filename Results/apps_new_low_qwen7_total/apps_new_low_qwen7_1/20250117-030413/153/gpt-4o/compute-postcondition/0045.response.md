Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `b[m-1]` is unchanged, `min_time` is the minimum value of `time_with_both_spells` found during the loop, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `c`, `d` and `remaining_manapoints` are unchanged, and `j` is 0. The current value of `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`**
