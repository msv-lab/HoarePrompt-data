#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the total number of potions available.
- `m`: an integer representing the number of spells with a fixed time cost.
- `k`: an integer representing the number of spells with a variable time cost.
- `x`: an integer representing the maximum time cost of a single potion.
- `s`: an integer representing the initial mana points.
- `a`: a list of `m` integers representing the time costs of the fixed spells.
- `b`: a list of `m` integers representing the mana costs of the fixed spells.
- `c`: a list of `k` integers representing the time costs of the variable spells.
- `d`: a list of `k` integers representing the mana costs of the variable spells.

The function calculates the minimum time required to use one potion through a series of nested loops:
1. It first checks if using a variable spell (`d[i] <= s`) can reduce the time needed to get a potion, considering the remaining potions available.
2. Then, it checks if using a fixed spell (`b[i] <= s`) can reduce the time needed to get a potion.
3. Finally, it iterates over both fixed and variable spells to find the optimal combination where the remaining mana points are used to cast both types of spells to get a potion in the minimum time.

The function returns `min_time`, which is the minimum time found to get a potion through any combination of spells and variable mana usage.
