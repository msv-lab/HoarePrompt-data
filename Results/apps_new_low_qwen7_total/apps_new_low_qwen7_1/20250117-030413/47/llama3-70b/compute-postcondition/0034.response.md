`count` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The value of `m` and `y` (which is `m + 1`) remain unchanged from the initial state. The output state is that `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the total number of integers `y` in the range from 1 to `m` such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0` plus 1, `m` is a positive integer, and `y` is `m + 1`.**
