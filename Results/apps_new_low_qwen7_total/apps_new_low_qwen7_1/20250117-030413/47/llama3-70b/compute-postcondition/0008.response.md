Postcondition: ***`count` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `y` is 2. If `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, then the condition is met and the postcondition remains as specified. If `(x + y) % 5 != 0`, then the postcondition also remains as specified since there is no additional change in the variables when the else part is executed.***
