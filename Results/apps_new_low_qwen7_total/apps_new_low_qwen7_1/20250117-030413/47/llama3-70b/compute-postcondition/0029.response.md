Postcondition: ***`count` is the total number of integers `y` in the range from 1 to `m` such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, and if `(x + y) % 5 == 0` holds true, `count` is incremented by 1. Here, `x` is `k + 1`, `m` must be a positive integer, and `y` is 1. If `(x + y) % 5 != 0`, `count` remains unchanged.***
