The given code reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from input, splits them using `map(int, input().split())`, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. Then, it initializes a variable `count` to 0. However, the code does not perform any operations that would change the values of `n` or `m` or `count` beyond their initial assignment. 

Since no further operations are performed on these variables within the provided code snippet, the values of `n`, `m`, and `count` remain as they were initially assigned.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, count is 0**
