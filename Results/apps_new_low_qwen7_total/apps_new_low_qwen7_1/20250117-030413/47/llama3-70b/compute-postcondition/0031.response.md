`count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `x` and `m` remain unchanged. The initial state describes that `count` is the total number of integers `y` in the range from 1 to `m` such that `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, `x` is `k + 1`, and `m` is a positive integer. Since `y` is defined as `m + 1`, it means `y` is no longer within the range from 1 to `m`, thus `count` should not consider this case anymore.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `x` is `k + 1`, `m` is a positive integer**
