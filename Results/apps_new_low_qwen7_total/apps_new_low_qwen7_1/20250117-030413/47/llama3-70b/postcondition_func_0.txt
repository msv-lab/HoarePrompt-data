The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\). It then iterates over all pairs \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\), counting the number of pairs for which \((x + y) \% 5 == 0\). After completing the iteration, it prints the count of such pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. An edge case to consider is when either `n` or `m` is zero, in which case no valid pairs exist, and the count remains zero. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
