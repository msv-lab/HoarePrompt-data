You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

Output
31

Input
1 5

Output
1

Input
3 8

Output
5

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\). It then iterates over all pairs \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\), counting the number of pairs for which \((x + y) \% 5 == 0\). After completing the iteration, it prints the count of such pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. An edge case to consider is when either `n` or `m` is zero, in which case no valid pairs exist, and the count remains zero. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program iterates through all possible pairs of integers (x, y) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. If so, it increments a counter. Finally, it prints the total count of such pairs.

Given the constraints (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\)), this brute-force approach is computationally expensive but will work correctly for the given problem. The logic implemented in the program accurately follows the problem statement and requirements.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution for counting the number of pairs (x, y) such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Correctness: **True**
