Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through all possible pairs of integers (x, y) where 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ m, and counts the pairs where (x + y) % 5 == 0. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this brute-force approach will correctly count all such pairs. Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
