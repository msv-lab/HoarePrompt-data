Reasoning:

The provided program iterates through all possible pairs of integers (x, y) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. If so, it increments a counter. Finally, it prints the total count of such pairs.

Given the constraints (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\)), this brute-force approach is computationally expensive but will work correctly for the given problem. The logic implemented in the program accurately follows the problem statement and requirements.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution for counting the number of pairs (x, y) such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Correctness: **True**
