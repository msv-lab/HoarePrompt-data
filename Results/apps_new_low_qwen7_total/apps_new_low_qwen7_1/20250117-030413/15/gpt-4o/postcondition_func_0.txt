The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`, where `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, and `p` is a list of `k` distinct integers within the range `[1, n]`. The function first checks if any element in `p` is less than `max_seen`, a variable initialized to 0. If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `-1`. Otherwise, it proceeds to sort `p` in non-decreasing order using a stack and updates `max_seen` accordingly. Then, it calculates the remaining numbers not present in `p` and sorts them in descending order. It constructs a new list `result` by appending elements from `p` and `remaining_numbers` in a specific order, ensuring the final list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the final check using the stack also passes, the function returns the sorted list `result`; otherwise, it returns `-1`. The function aims to ensure that all elements in the final list are in non-decreasing order and that no element in the original `p` was less than `max_seen` throughout the process.
