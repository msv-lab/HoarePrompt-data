Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. **Main Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`. If it finds such a number, it immediately returns `-1`, which aligns with the problem statement.
   - The function then sorts `p` using a stack, updating `max_seen` appropriately. This ensures that `p` can be part of a stack-sortable permutation.
   - It then calculates the remaining numbers not present in `p` and sorts them in descending order.
   - The function constructs a new list `result` by appending elements from `p` and `remaining_numbers` in a specific order, ensuring the final list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - A final check using the stack ensures the entire list is stack-sortable.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the input `p` cannot form a stack-sortable permutation by returning `-1`.
   - It ensures the lexicographically maximal permutation is returned by sorting `remaining_numbers` in descending order before adding them to `result`.

Given the provided annotated program and the logic explained above, the function appears to follow the problem description accurately and handles all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
