### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness against the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into components, which is correct.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - It initializes the stack and `max_seen` and processes the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
   - This part of the code checks if any element in `p` is less than `max_seen`. If such an element is found, it returns `-1`, which is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Processing Initial Elements**:
   - The code maintains the stack and ensures the stack is always in a valid state where the top of the stack is always greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
   - This is achieved by popping elements from the stack if they are smaller than the current element being processed and updating `max_seen` accordingly.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - It calculates the remaining numbers needed to complete the permutation by finding the difference between the set of all numbers from `1` to `n` and the set of numbers in `p`.
   - These remaining numbers are sorted in descending order to ensure the lexicographically maximal permutation.
   - It constructs the full permutation `result` by appending the remaining numbers and ensuring the stack remains valid.

5. **Validation**:
   - After constructing the full permutation, it performs another check to ensure the constructed permutation is valid.
   - This check involves pushing elements into the stack and ensuring no element in the final permutation is less than `max_seen`.

6. **Output**:
   - If the permutation is valid, it prints the permutation; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Validation Using Function Summary:

- The function summary accurately describes the logic of the `func_1` function.
- It correctly identifies invalid permutations early by checking if any element in `p` is less than `max_seen`.
- It constructs the permutation by ensuring the stack is maintained properly and handles the remaining elements in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
- The final check ensures the constructed permutation is valid.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the detailed analysis and validation using the function summary, the program logic aligns with the problem description and the function summary. The program correctly identifies invalid permutations early and constructs valid permutations in the required lexicographical order.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
