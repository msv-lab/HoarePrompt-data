Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic and steps taken in the code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into components.
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes necessary variables like `stack`, `max_seen`, and processes the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
3. **Processing Initial Elements**:
   - It checks if the current number `num` is less than `max_seen`. If true, it returns `-1` indicating that the permutation is not stack-sortable.
   - Otherwise, it maintains the stack and ensures the stack is always in a valid state where the top of the stack is always greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
4. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - It calculates the remaining numbers needed to complete the permutation.
   - It sorts these remaining numbers in descending order to ensure the lexicographically maximal permutation.
   - It constructs the full permutation `result` by appending the remaining numbers and ensuring the stack remains valid.
5. **Validation**: After constructing the full permutation, it performs another check to ensure the constructed permutation is valid.
6. **Output**: If the permutation is valid, it prints the permutation; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the detailed steps, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program logic aligns with the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
