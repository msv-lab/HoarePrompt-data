Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly initializes `stack` and `max_seen`.
2. It first validates that no element in `p` is less than `max_seen`. This step ensures that the initial sequence of `p` respects the stack-sortable property.
3. It then populates `remaining_numbers` with the elements not present in `p`, sorting them in descending order to ensure the lexicographically maximal permutation.
4. The function constructs the result by merging `p` and `remaining_numbers` in a way that maintains the stack-sortable property.
5. Finally, it performs a second validation to ensure the entire constructed `result` is stack-sortable.

Given the detailed steps outlined in the execution summary, the function correctly follows the logic required to ensure the permutation is stack-sortable while adhering to the lexicographical maximization criteria.

Correctness: **True**
