### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`.
   - It checks if the permutation `p` can be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation of size `n`.
   - If `p` cannot be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the lexicographically maximal permutation.

2. **Initial Checks and Stack Management**:
   - The function initializes an empty stack and a variable `max_seen` to track the maximum value seen so far.
   - It iterates through the list `p` and ensures that each element is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
   - If an element in `p` is smaller than `max_seen`, it immediately returns `-1`.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing `p`, it identifies the remaining numbers that are not in `p` and sorts them in descending order.
   - It then extends the `stack` with these remaining numbers in descending order and ensures that the resulting permutation is still stack-sortable.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - The function re-verifies the stack-sortability of the constructed permutation by checking each element against `max_seen` and adjusting the stack accordingly.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - If the construction is successful, it returns the constructed permutation.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where `p` cannot be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation by returning `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic and the provided examples, the function appears to correctly identify whether the given prefix `p` can be extended to a stack-sortable permutation of size `n` and construct the lexicographically maximal such permutation if possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
