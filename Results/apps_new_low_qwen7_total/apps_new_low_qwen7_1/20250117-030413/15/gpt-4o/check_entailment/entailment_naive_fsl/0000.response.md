Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the given permutation prefix is already stack-sortable but the program tries to extend it with numbers that violate the stack-sortable property. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the remaining numbers are appended in a way that maintains the stack-sortable property.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 1
3
```
The initial permutation prefix is `[3]`. The program should generate the lexicographically maximal permutation `[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]` which is stack-sortable. However, the program incorrectly generates the same permutation `[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]` instead of `-1` since no additional numbers can be appended without violating the stack-sortable property.

Additionally, for the input:
```
5 2
3 4
```
The initial permutation prefix is `[3, 4]`. The program incorrectly returns `[-1]` because it cannot generate a valid stack-sortable permutation by appending any remaining numbers while maintaining the stack-sortable property. The correct output should be `-1`.

Thus, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly and fails to produce the correct output in certain scenarios.
