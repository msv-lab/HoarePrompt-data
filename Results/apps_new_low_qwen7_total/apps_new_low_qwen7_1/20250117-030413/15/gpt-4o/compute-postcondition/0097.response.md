The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the top element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. According to the initial state, `stack` contains the second element of `result`, which is `max_seen`. After popping, `max_seen` will now hold this value, but the `stack` will be empty since it only contained one element.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element and `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`, `stack` is empty, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the second element of `result`.**
