`result` appends the value popped from `stack`. Since the second last element of `stack` was less than `num`, and `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, the popped element (second last element) will be removed from `stack`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least one element (since the second last element was popped), `result` contains the value of the second last element of `stack` before popping.**
