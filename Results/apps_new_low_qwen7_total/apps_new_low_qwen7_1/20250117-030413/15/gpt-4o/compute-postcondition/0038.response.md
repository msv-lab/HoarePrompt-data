To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Initial Condition**: The `remaining_numbers` list must contain at least one element, and `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack`) and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the loop condition must be true:
- `stack` should not be empty.
- The last element of `stack` should be less than `num`.

Given that `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in `stack` that is less than `num` for the loop to proceed.

Let's summarize this:
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element (already given).
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- There must be at least one element in `stack` that is less than `num`.

So, the state right before the loop must ensure that `stack` contains at least one element that is less than `num`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and `stack` must contain at least one element that is less than `num`**
