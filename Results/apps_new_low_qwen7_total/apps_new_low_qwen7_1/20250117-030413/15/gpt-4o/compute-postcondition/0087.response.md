To determine the final output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `num` is the second element of `result`.
   - `stack` contains the second element of `result`.
   - `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`.
   - In each iteration, `max_seen` is set to `stack.pop()`, and `stack` loses its last element.
   - The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.

3. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `remaining_numbers`: Remains an empty list.
   - `num`: Remains the second element of `result`.
   - `stack`: Continuously loses its last element until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met.
   - `max_seen`: Updates to the value popped from `stack` in each iteration.
   - `result`: Remains unchanged.
   - `num` and `stack[-1]` relationship: `stack[-1]` will eventually be greater than or equal to `num`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < num`.
   - Once `stack[-1] >= num`, the loop stops executing.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `stack` will be empty or will have an element such that `stack[-1] >= num`.
   - `max_seen` will hold the last value that was popped from `stack` (i.e., it will be `stack[-1]` if `stack` is not empty, otherwise it will be the value that made the loop stop).
   - `num` remains the second element of `result`.
   - `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
   - `result` remains unchanged.
   - `stack` will either be empty or its last element will be greater than or equal to `num`.

### Final Output State

```plaintext
Output State: remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the second element of result, stack is an empty list or its last element is greater than or equal to num, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the last value popped from stack.
