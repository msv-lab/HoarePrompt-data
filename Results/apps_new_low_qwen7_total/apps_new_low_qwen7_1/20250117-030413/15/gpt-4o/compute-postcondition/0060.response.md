To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed.
- `result` contains the last element of `stack`.

Let's analyze the loop condition:

1. **`stack` must be non-empty**: The current state already mentions that `stack` is non-empty (with its last element removed), so this part is satisfied.
2. **`stack[-1] < num`**: This is the critical part of the loop condition. For the loop to continue, the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

Since `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, for the loop to continue, the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `stack[-1] < num`.

**Adjusted State:**
- `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed.
- `stack[-1] < num` (to satisfy the loop condition).

State: **`remaining_numbers` contains at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed, and `stack[-1] < num`**
