The code `result.append(stack.pop())` impacts the following variables:
- `stack`: The last element (which is `stack[-1]`) is popped from `stack`.
- `result`: The last element of `stack` is appended to `result`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` must contain at least one element.
- `stack[-1]` must be less than `num`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`.
- The value of `stack[-1]` before the pop operation is now removed from `stack`.

Since `stack[-1]` was less than `num`, after popping, `stack` will still have at least one element, but `stack[-1]` will no longer be present.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least one element, `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped, and the last element of `stack` is removed.**
