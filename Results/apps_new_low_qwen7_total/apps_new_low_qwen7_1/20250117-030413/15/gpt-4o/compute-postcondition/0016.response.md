To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop: `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack`) and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `stack` must be non-empty initially, and `stack[-1]` must be less than `num`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\).
   - `stack` is a list containing one element `num`.

Given that `stack` contains only one element `num` right before the loop, for the loop to execute, `stack` must be non-empty (which it already is) and `stack[-1]` (which is `num`) must be less than some value that will be checked against `num` in the loop.

Since `num` is the only element in `stack` and no further information about `num` is given, we need to ensure that `num` is less than some value that can potentially enter the stack during the execution of the loop.

However, the current state of `num` alone does not provide enough information to guarantee the loop's execution because we don't know what `num` is relative to any potential future values that might be added to the stack.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can only say that `stack` must be non-empty, which it is, but we cannot specify any further constraints on `num` without additional context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one element `num`, and `stack` must be non-empty.**
