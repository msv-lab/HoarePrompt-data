The code `result.append(stack.pop())` impacts the program by popping the last element from `stack` and appending it to `result`. Given the initial state:

- `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed.
- `stack[-1] < num` (to satisfy the loop condition).

After executing the code, the last element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`. The other conditions and the value of `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` contains at least one element; `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`; `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed and its second last element was popped and appended to `result`; `stack[-1] < num` (still satisfied)**
