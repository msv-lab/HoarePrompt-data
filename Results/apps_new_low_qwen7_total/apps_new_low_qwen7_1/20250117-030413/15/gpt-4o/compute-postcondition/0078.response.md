The only objects in the loop head are variables `num` and `result`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` and the state of `result`.

At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the first element of `result`, `stack` contains `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the second element of `result`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `result` to iterate over.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the second element of `result`, `stack` contains the second element of `result`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**.
