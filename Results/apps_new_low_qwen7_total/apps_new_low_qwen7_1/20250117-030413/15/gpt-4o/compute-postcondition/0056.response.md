To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions within the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack`) AND the last element of `stack` is less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack` contains all its original elements plus `num` at the end.
   - `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` was met.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Check if `stack` is not empty**: Since `num` is added to the end of `stack`, `stack` will always be non-empty when the loop starts, assuming `remaining_numbers` is not empty.

2. **Check if `stack[-1] < num`**: This is the critical condition that controls whether the loop will execute the first time. For the loop to execute the first time, the last element of `stack` (which is `num`) must be less than `num` itself. However, this cannot be true because `num` cannot be less than itself.

Given that `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers` and has been appended to `stack`, the only way for the loop to execute the first time is if the last element of `stack` (which is `num`) is not greater than or equal to `num`.

### Conclusion:

Since `num` cannot be less than itself, the loop will not execute the first time based on the given conditions. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can proceed. 

To make the loop execute the first time, the last element of `stack` (which is `num`) must be less than some other number that could be in `stack`. However, since `num` is the only element explicitly mentioned as being appended to `stack`, the only way to satisfy the loop condition is if there was an element in `stack` before appending `num` that was less than `num`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains all its original elements plus `num` at the end, and `stack` must contain an element that is less than `num` before the last element (`num`) is added.**

This ensures that the loop condition `stack[-1] < num` can be satisfied for the first iteration.
