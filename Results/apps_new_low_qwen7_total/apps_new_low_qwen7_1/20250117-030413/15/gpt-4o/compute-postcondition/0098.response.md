Output State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element and `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`, `stack` is empty, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the second element of `result`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - `remaining_numbers` is initially an empty list.
   - `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element.
   - `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by the current `num`.
   - `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - `max_seen` is the maximum value seen so far, and if `num < max_seen`, the function returns -1 (though this is not relevant to the final state since we assume the loop completes).

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `num` remains the same throughout the loop as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `max_seen` is updated to the top element of `stack` each time the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` is met.
   - `stack` is modified by popping its top element each time the condition is met.
   - `result` and `remaining_numbers` remain unchanged outside the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to execute as long as the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.
   - Each iteration of the loop pops the top element from `stack` and updates `max_seen` to that element.
   - Once `stack` becomes empty or the top element of `stack` is no longer less than `num`, the loop stops.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop, `stack` will be empty because all its elements have been popped out.
   - `max_seen` will be the last element that was popped from `stack`, which is the second element of `result` (since `num` was always strictly greater than the second element of `result`).

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is as described above.
