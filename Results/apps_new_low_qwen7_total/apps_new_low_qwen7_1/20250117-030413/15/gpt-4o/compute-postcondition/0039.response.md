`result.append(stack.pop())` adds the last element of `stack` to `result` and removes it from `stack`. Given the initial conditions, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and `stack` contains at least one element that is less than `num`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`.
- The last element of `stack` is no longer in `stack`.

Since the exact values of `remaining_numbers` and `stack` are not provided, we know that:
- `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.
- `stack` loses its last element, which was less than `num`.
- `result` gains the last element of `stack`.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least one element (now without its last element), and `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped.**
