Postcondition: ***`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element, `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by the current `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the maximum value seen so far, if `num < max_seen`, the function returns -1, otherwise no change to the state of the variables.***
