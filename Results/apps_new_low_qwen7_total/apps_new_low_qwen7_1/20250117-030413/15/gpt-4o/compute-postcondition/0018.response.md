To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`.

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions in the `and` statement must be true:
1. The `stack` must not be empty (`stack` is non-empty).
2. The last element of the `stack` must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
- `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\)
- `stack` is an empty list
- `max_seen` is equal to `num`

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Stack Condition**: The `stack` is empty (`[]`). For the loop to execute again, `stack` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stack` to ensure it contains at least one element.

2. **Last Element Condition**: Since the `stack` is empty, there is no last element to check against `num`. However, even if the `stack` were non-empty, the loop would still require the last element of the `stack` to be less than `num` for another iteration. Since the `stack` is empty, this condition is inherently false and cannot be satisfied without first adjusting the `stack`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `stack` to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`stack` is a non-empty list**
