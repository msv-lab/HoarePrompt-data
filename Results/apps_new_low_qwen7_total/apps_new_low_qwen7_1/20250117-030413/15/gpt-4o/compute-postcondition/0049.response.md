Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. This means the loop will continue as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack` contains at least one element (excluding the last element).
   - The last element of `stack` was less than `num`.
   - `result` contains the last element of `stack`.

3. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`, we need to ensure that both conditions (`stack` is not empty and `stack[-1] < num`) are met for the loop to execute again.
   - The `remaining_numbers` state does not affect the loop continuation since it is not part of the loop head condition.
   - The `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and since `remaining_numbers` must still contain at least one element, `num` should still be the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - The `stack` must still be non-empty and the last element of `stack` must still be less than `num` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is the last element of `stack` to ensure it remains less than `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains at least one element (excluding the last element), and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`; `result` contains the last element of `stack`**.
