Output State: `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met; if the loop does not execute, `stack` will still contain the first element of `remaining_numbers`.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as the stack is not empty and the last element of the stack is less than `num`.
   - `remaining_numbers` starts with at least one element, and `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack` initially contains all elements of `remaining_numbers` plus `num` at the end.
   - `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `remaining_numbers`: It remains unchanged because its first element is taken out in each iteration and put into `num`.
   - `num`: It changes to the next element in `remaining_numbers` after each iteration.
   - `stack`: Elements are popped from it when the last element is less than `num`.
   - `result`: It accumulates popped elements from `stack`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to pop elements from `stack` until the last element of `stack` is no longer less than `num`.
   - Once `stack[-1] >= num`, the loop stops executing.
   - If `remaining_numbers` runs out of elements before the loop stops, `num` will be the only element left in `stack`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - When the loop exits, `remaining_numbers` will still have at least one element (`num`).
   - `stack` will contain either the first element of `remaining_numbers` (if no more elements can be popped) or the first element of `remaining_numbers` followed by elements that were not popped because they were greater than or equal to `num`.
   - `result` will contain all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met.

Thus, the final state is as described above.
