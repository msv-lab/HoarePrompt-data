`max_seen` is assigned the value popped from `stack`. However, the initial value of `stack` is not specified, so we can only say that `max_seen` now holds the top value of `stack`, and `stack` has lost its top element. The state of `stack` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`; `stack` is one element shorter than before.**
