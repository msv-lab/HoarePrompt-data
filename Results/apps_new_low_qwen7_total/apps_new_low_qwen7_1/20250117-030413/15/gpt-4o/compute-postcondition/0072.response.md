Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. This means the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` (i.e., `stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `num` must be the first element of `result`.
   - `stack` has at least one element fewer than before, and the top element is now stored in `max_seen`.
   - `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

3. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` must still be true.
   - The key parts of this condition are:
     - `stack` should not be empty.
     - The top element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) should be less than `num`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `stack` already has at least one element fewer than before, it could potentially be empty if `stack` had only one element initially. To ensure the loop can execute, `stack` should not be empty.
   - The current `num` is `result[0]` and it is greater than or equal to `max_seen`. We need to ensure that there is at least one element in `stack` that is less than `num`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `stack` is not empty and that the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.

State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` must be the first element of `result`, `stack` must have at least one element and the top element must be less than `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**.
