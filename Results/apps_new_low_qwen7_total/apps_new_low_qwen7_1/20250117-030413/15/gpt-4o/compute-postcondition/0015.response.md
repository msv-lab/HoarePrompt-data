Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one element `num`, if `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of the variables.***
