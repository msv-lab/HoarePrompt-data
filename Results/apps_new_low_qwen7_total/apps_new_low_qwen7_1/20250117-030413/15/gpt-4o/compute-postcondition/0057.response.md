The code `result.append(stack.pop())` pops the last element from `stack` and appends it to `result`. Given the initial conditions:

- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` contains all its original elements plus `num` at the end.
- `stack` must contain an element that is less than `num` before the last element (`num`) is added.

After executing `stack.pop()`, the last element of `stack` (which is `num`) is removed. This means that the element that was less than `num` remains in `stack`. Also, this element is appended to `result`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `stack` now contains all its original elements except `num`.
- `result` now contains all its original elements plus the element that was less than `num`.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element; `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`; `stack` now contains all its original elements except `num`; `result` now contains all its original elements plus the element that was less than `num`.**
