The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the `stack`. Since the initial state does not specify what `num` is, we can denote `num` as an unspecified integer. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one additional element `num`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the original stack.**
