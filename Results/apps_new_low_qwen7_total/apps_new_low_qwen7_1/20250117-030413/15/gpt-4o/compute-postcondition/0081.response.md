Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves two variables: `stack` and `num`.

2. **Condition of the Loop**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `num` is the second element of `result`.
   - `stack` contains the second element of `result`.
   - `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. This condition does not affect the loop head directly but ensures that `num` is properly set.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes the First Time**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `stack` must not be empty.
   - The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

5. **Current State of `stack`**:
   - Since `stack` contains the second element of `result`, and `result` is non-decreasing, we need to ensure that the second element of `result` is less than `num`.

6. **Current State of `num`**:
   - `num` is the second element of `result`, so this part is already satisfied if `stack` has the second element of `result` as its last element.

Therefore, the key requirement is that `stack` should not be empty and its last element should be less than `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the second element of `result`, `stack` contains the second element of `result` and is not empty, `stack[-1]` is less than `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.**
