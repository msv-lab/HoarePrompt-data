Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is less than `num`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Stack**: The stack starts empty. Elements are popped from the stack if the top element is less than `num`.
- **Max_seen**: Initially `max_seen` is set to 0. Each time an element is popped from the stack, `max_seen` is updated to the value of the popped element.
- **Num**: This is the first element of the list `p` and remains constant throughout the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop pops elements from the stack until the top element is no longer less than `num`. After each pop, `max_seen` is updated to the new top element of the stack. The process continues until the stack is empty or the top element is no longer less than `num`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided output states, we can see that:
- The stack becomes empty after the loop completes.
- `max_seen` is updated to the maximum value seen in the stack during the loop.

### Final Output State
After the loop finishes, the following conditions hold:
- The stack is empty because all elements that were popped satisfy the condition `stack[-1] < num` and there are no more elements left to pop.
- `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack at any point during the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack during the loop, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
