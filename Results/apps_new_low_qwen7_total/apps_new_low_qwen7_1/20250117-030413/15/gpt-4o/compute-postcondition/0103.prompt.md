You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000 and 1 ≤ k < n, p is a list of k integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range [1, n].
def func_1(n, k, p):
    stack = []

max_seen = 0
    for num in p:
        if num < max_seen:
            return -1
        
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            max_seen = stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.
    #   - The condition `if num < max_seen` ensures the function returns `-1` immediately if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`. However, based on the provided outputs, we assume no such number exists.
    #   - If the current `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, the loop continues and `max_seen` is updated to the popped value if the top of the stack is less than `num`. This ensures `max_seen` always contains the maximum value seen so far in the stack.
    #   - Finally, `num` is appended to the `stack`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `max_seen` is updated during each iteration but remains the highest value in the stack after the loop.
    #   - `stack` accumulates all elements from `p` in a way that it maintains non-decreasing order.
    #   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the input state.
    #   - `p` remains unchanged but its elements are processed.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop processes each element of `p` exactly once.
    #   - `stack` will contain all elements of `p` in a sorted manner, with `max_seen` being the last element in `stack`.
    #   - No element in `p` is less than `max_seen` after the loop, ensuring the loop can fully process `p`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - After processing all elements in `p`, `stack` will have all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order.
    #   - `max_seen` will be the largest value in `stack`, which is the last element of `stack`.
    #
    #Thus, after the loop completes, the `stack` will be a sorted list of `p`, and `max_seen` will be the largest value in this sorted list.
    remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)

remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)

result = p[:]
    for num in remaining_numbers:
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            result.append(stack.pop())
        
        stack.append(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_numbers` is [], `num` is the last element in the initial `remaining_numbers` list, `stack` contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, followed by all elements from `remaining_numbers` in the order they were added, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.
    result.extend(reversed(stack))

stack = []

max_seen = 0
    for num in result:
        if num < max_seen:
            return -1
        
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            max_seen = stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the third element of result, stack contains the third element of result, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, and max_seen is the second element of result.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' which contains elements from 'p' in non-decreasing order
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `p`. If any condition results in returning -1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns a list `result` containing elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1

Case_3: The program returns -1

Case_4: The program returns -1

Case_5: The program returns -1

Case_6: The program returns -1

Case_7: The program returns the list 'result' which contains elements from 'p' in non-decreasing order


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
