`result` appends the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack[-1]` is less than `num`, `pop` removes the last element from `stack`. The initial state is that `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and `stack` must be non-empty with its last element being less than `num`. After executing the code, `result` will have the last element of `stack` appended to it, `stack` will have its last element removed, and `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` contains at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` is non-empty with its last element removed, and `result` contains the last element of `stack`**
