Postcondition: ***`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the second element of `result`, `stack` contains the second element of `result`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order. If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
