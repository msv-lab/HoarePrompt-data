The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. This operation changes the state of both `stack` and `max_seen`. 

- Initially, `max_seen` refers to the last element in `stack`.
- After popping, `max_seen` is now set to that value, and the `stack` loses its last element.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `max_seen` is the value of the last element in the original `stack`.
- The `stack` has one fewer element than before, and the last element is no longer there.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` contains at least one fewer element than before and the last element `stack[-1]` is not defined (as it was popped), `max_seen` is the value of the last element that was in the original `stack`.**
