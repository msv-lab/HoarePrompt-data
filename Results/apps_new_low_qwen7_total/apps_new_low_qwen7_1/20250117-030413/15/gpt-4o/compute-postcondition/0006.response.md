The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the top element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Initially, `stack` contains only the integer `1`. Therefore, `stack.pop()` will return `1`, and this value will be assigned to `max_seen`.

- The value of `stack` changes from `[1]` to `[]`.
- The value of `max_seen` changes to `1`.

The states of other variables (`n`, `k`, `p`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**
