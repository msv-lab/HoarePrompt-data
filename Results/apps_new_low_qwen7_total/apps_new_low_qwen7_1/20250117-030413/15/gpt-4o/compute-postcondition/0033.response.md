Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was originally in the stack.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop condition `while stack and stack[-1] < num:` checks if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) is less than the current `num`.
   - If the condition is met, the top element of the stack is popped and assigned to `max_seen`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `k` remain constant as they are not involved in any changes inside the loop.
   - `p` remains constant as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `stack` is modified; each time the loop executes, the top element of the stack is popped.
   - `max_seen` is updated with the value of the last popped element each time the loop executes.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to pop elements from the stack until either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack is no longer less than `num`.
   - After all iterations, `stack` will be empty because all elements are popped out, and `max_seen` will hold the value of the last element that was in the original stack.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Given that the loop continues to pop elements from the stack as long as the top element is less than `num`, once the stack is empty, the loop terminates.
   - `max_seen` retains the value of the last element that was in the stack before the loop started, ensuring that the final state matches the expected conditions.

Thus, after the loop has executed and completed all its iterations, `stack` will be empty, and `max_seen` will be the maximum value originally in the stack.
