Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `p`. The only variable being updated in each iteration is `num`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the last element of `p` that was processed. 

3. **Understand the loop execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next `num` needs to be taken from the list `p`. This means we need to remove the current `num` from `p` and consider the next element.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `n` remains unchanged because it's not involved in the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it's not involved in the loop head.
   - `p` is now one element shorter since the current `num` has been processed.
   - `stack` remains unchanged because it's not involved in the loop head.
   - `max_seen` remains unchanged because it's not involved in the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After processing the current `num`, the next `num` should be the next element in the list `p`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one additional element `num`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the original stack**.
