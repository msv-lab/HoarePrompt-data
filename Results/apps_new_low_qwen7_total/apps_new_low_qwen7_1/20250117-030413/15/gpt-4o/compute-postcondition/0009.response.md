The loop condition for the given `while` loop is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The stack must contain at least one element.
2. The top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `stack` contains at least one element less than `num`.
- `max_seen` is the top element of the `stack`.
- `num` is the first element of the list `p`.
- `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, the top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) must still be less than `num`. Since `num` is already greater than or equal to `max_seen`, and `max_seen` is the top element of the stack, `num` being greater than or equal to `max_seen` does not change the fact that `stack[-1]` was less than `num` in the previous iteration. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `num` or `max_seen`.

However, to ensure the loop can continue, we need to maintain the condition that `stack` contains at least one element. Since the loop body removes elements from the stack while the top element is less than `num`, we need to ensure that the stack still has at least one element after the loop body executes.

Thus, we need to ensure that the stack still contains at least one element. This means we need to keep the information that `stack` contains at least one element less than `num`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` must contain at least one element less than `num`, `max_seen` is the top element of the `stack`, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**
