Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), k is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), p is a list of k integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range [1, n], stack is a list containing all elements of p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the last element of the stack, remaining_numbers is a list of integers from 1 to n that are not in p, sorted in descending order, result is a copy of the list p
Code of the loop:
for num in remaining_numbers:
    while stack and stack[-1] < num:
        result.append(stack.pop())
    stack.append(num)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains the original elements plus `num` at the end, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains all its original elements plus `num` at the end, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met; if the loop does not execute, `stack` will still contain the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element; `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`; `stack` contains the value of `num`; `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met, and then `remaining_numbers` pops the first element and assigns it to `num`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
