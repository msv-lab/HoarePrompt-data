`max_seen` is assigned the value of the top element of `stack`, which is popped off the stack. Since `max_seen` was previously the top element of `stack` which is less than `num`, it remains unchanged in value but is now reassigned. The `stack` now has one less element, but it is not empty.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, `stack` has one less element than before and is not empty, `max_seen` is the previous top element of `stack`, and `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order**
