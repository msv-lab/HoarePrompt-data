The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. The value of `max_seen` is now the last element of the `stack`, and the `stack` loses its last element.

Output State: **`stack` is a non-empty list with one less element, `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack`**
