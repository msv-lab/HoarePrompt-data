The code `result.append(stack.pop())` impacts the following variables:
- `result` appends the last element of `stack` to itself.
- `stack` pops its last element.

Given the initial state:
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` must contain at least two elements (now without its last element).
- `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `stack` now has one less element than before.
- `result` now has one more element, which is the last element of `stack` before it was popped.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least one element, and `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped, plus the new element which is the last element of `stack` before the pop operation.**
