Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `remaining_numbers`.
   - Therefore, the key variables involved in the loop head are `num` (the current number being iterated over) and `remaining_numbers`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `remaining_numbers`:**
   - `remaining_numbers` is a list of integers from 1 to n that are not in `p`, sorted in descending order.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_numbers` must have at least one element. If `remaining_numbers` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `num`:**
   - Since the loop starts by taking the first element from `remaining_numbers`, `num` must be the first element of `remaining_numbers`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - Other variables like `n`, `k`, `p`, `stack`, `max_seen`, and `result` do not directly affect whether the loop starts. They are part of the context but not the control variables for the loop itself.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that for the loop to execute the first time:

- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` must be the first element of `remaining_numbers`.

So, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, and `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`**
