The code `stack.append(num)` appends the current value of `num` to the `stack`. This changes the state of the `stack` but does not affect the `remaining_numbers` or `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` is empty.
- `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met, and then `remaining_numbers` pops the first element and assigns it to `num`.

After executing `stack.append(num)`:
- The `stack` now contains the value of `num`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` contains at least one element; `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`; `stack` contains the value of `num`; `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order until the condition `stack[-1] >= num` is met, and then `remaining_numbers` pops the first element and assigns it to `num`.**
