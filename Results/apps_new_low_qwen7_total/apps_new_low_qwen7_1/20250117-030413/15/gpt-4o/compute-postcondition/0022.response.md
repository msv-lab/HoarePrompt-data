Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates as long as the `stack` is not empty and the top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`. If these conditions are met, the loop pops the top element from the stack and updates `max_seen` to the popped value.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: The initial state includes `n`, `k`, and `p`, which remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **Variables Changed by the Loop**:
  - `stack`: Elements are popped from the stack if the condition `stack[-1] < num` is satisfied.
  - `max_seen`: Updated to the last value popped from the stack if the condition is met.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the stack that are less than `num`. Each iteration of the loop removes one element from the stack and sets `max_seen` to that element. Therefore, the loop will continue until all elements in the stack are greater than or equal to `num`.

### Verify Relationships
Given the output states after the loop has executed 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer the general behavior:
- After 1 execution, the stack is empty, and `max_seen` is set to the last element of the original stack.
- After 2 executions, the stack has one less element, and `max_seen` is updated accordingly.
- After 3 executions, the stack has two less elements, and `max_seen` is the last remaining element after popping.

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue until the stack is empty or all elements in the stack are greater than or equal to `num`.

### Determine Final Output State
If the loop runs until the stack is empty, it means all elements in the stack were popped because each pop operation makes the stack smaller. The final value of `max_seen` will be the maximum value that was originally in the stack.

### Final Output State
Since the loop continues to run as long as the stack contains elements less than `num`, and eventually, the stack will be emptied, the final state will be:
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the original stack.**
