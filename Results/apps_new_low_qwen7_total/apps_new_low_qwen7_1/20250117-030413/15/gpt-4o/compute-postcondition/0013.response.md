Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
   - `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\)
   - `stack` is a list containing one element `num`
   - `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack during the loop (which is now `num`)
   - `num` is the first element of the list `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `p`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - We need to determine the state after one iteration of the loop.

4. **Current State**:
   - `num` is the first element of `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `p`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - After processing the current `num`, the next `num` will be the next element in the list `p`.
   - The `max_seen` will remain the same unless the new `num` is greater than `max_seen`.

6. **Adjusted States**:
   - `num` will be updated to the next element in `p`.
   - `max_seen` will remain the same if the next `num` is not greater than `max_seen`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `num` will be the second element of the list `p`.
- `max_seen` will remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one element `num`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack during the loop (which is now the first element of `p`), `num` is the second element of the list `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
