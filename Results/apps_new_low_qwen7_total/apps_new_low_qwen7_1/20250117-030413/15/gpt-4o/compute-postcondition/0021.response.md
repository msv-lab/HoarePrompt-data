`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of `stack`. Since `stack[-1]` is less than `num`, after popping, `max_seen` will have the value of `stack[-1]`. The state of `stack` changes by removing its last element.

Output State: **`stack` is a non-empty list with its last element removed, `max_seen` is equal to `stack[-1]` which was less than `num`.**
