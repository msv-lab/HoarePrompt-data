`max_seen` is assigned the value of the last element in the `stack` list, which is popped off the stack. The value of `max_seen` is now the value of the last element in the `stack` before the pop operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing at least one fewer element than before where the last element is `max_seen`, `max_seen` is the value of the last element that was in the original stack.**
