Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.
   - The condition `if num < max_seen` ensures the function returns `-1` immediately if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`. However, based on the provided outputs, we assume no such number exists.
   - If the current `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, the loop continues and `max_seen` is updated to the popped value if the top of the stack is less than `num`. This ensures `max_seen` always contains the maximum value seen so far in the stack.
   - Finally, `num` is appended to the `stack`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `max_seen` is updated during each iteration but remains the highest value in the stack after the loop.
   - `stack` accumulates all elements from `p` in a way that it maintains non-decreasing order.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the input state.
   - `p` remains unchanged but its elements are processed.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop processes each element of `p` exactly once.
   - `stack` will contain all elements of `p` in a sorted manner, with `max_seen` being the last element in `stack`.
   - No element in `p` is less than `max_seen` after the loop, ensuring the loop can fully process `p`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After processing all elements in `p`, `stack` will have all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - `max_seen` will be the largest value in `stack`, which is the last element of `stack`.

Thus, after the loop completes, the `stack` will be a sorted list of `p`, and `max_seen` will be the largest value in this sorted list.
