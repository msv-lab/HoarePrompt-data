To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
```
This means the loop continues as long as:
1. `stack` is not empty (`stack` is true).
2. The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

### Given States
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` must contain at least one element (now without its last element).
- `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - `stack` must be non-empty.
   - The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `stack` now has at least one element (but without its last element).
   - `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped, meaning `stack[-1]` was `result`.

Given these points, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `stack` must still be non-empty.
- The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must still be less than `num`.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `stack` is now without its last element, we need to ensure that `stack` is not empty after the next pop operation. This means `stack` must have at least two elements before the current last element is popped.
- Additionally, the last element of `stack` after the pop operation must be less than `num`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required are:
- Ensure `stack` has at least two elements.
- Ensure the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

### Final Answer
State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least two elements (now without its last element), and `result` contains the last element of `stack` before it was popped.**
