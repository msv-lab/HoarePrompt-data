In the initial state:
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `num` is the second element of `result`.
- `stack` contains the second element of `result`.
- `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `max_seen` holds the maximum value seen so far, which is updated when `num` is less than `max_seen`.

The code snippet is:
```python
stack.append(num)
```

This line of code appends the value of `num` to the `stack`. Since `num` is the second element of `result`, this means `stack` will now contain two elements: the first one being the second element of `result`, and the second one being `num`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
- `num` remains the second element of `result`.
- `stack` now contains the second element of `result` followed by `num`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `max_seen` remains unchanged because the value of `num` was not used to update `max_seen` in this operation.

### Final Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the second element of result, stack contains the second element of result followed by num, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the maximum value seen so far.
```
```
remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the second element of result, stack contains the second element of result followed by num, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the maximum value seen so far.
