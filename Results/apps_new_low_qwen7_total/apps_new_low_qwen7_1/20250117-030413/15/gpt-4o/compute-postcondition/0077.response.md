The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state:

- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `num` is the first element of `result`.
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

The variable `num` is appended to `stack`, making `stack` no longer empty and containing `num` as its only element. The other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the first element of `result`, `stack` contains `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
