The `max_seen` variable is assigned the value of the top element of the `stack` and then that element is popped from the `stack`. Since the `stack` contains at least one element less than `num`, and `num` is the first element of the list `p`, the `max_seen` variable now holds the value of the top element of the `stack`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` contains at least one element less than `num`, `max_seen` is the top element of the `stack`, `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**
