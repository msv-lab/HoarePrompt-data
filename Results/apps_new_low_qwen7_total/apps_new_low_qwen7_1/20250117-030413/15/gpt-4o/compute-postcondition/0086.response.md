`max_seen` is assigned the value popped from `stack`. The value of `max_seen` is now the value previously at the top of `stack`. Since the new top element of `stack` must be less than `num`, the precondition remains valid.

Output State: **`max_seen` is the value previously at the top of `stack`, `stack` does not contain the old `max_seen` value at its top, and the new top element of `stack` must be less than `num`.**
