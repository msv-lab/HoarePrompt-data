Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: remaining_numbers is [], num is undefined, stack is [], result contains all elements from p in non-decreasing order followed by all elements from remaining_numbers in reverse order
Code of the loop:
for num in result:
    if num < max_seen:
        return -1
    while stack and stack[-1] < num:
        max_seen = stack.pop()
    stack.append(num)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the first element of `result`, `stack` contains `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: In the initial state:
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `num` is the second element of `result`.
- `stack` contains the second element of `result`.
- `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `max_seen` holds the maximum value seen so far, which is updated when `num` is less than `max_seen`.

The code snippet is:
```python
stack.append(num)
```

This line of code appends the value of `num` to the `stack`. Since `num` is the second element of `result`, this means `stack` will now contain two elements: the first one being the second element of `result`, and the second one being `num`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
- `num` remains the second element of `result`.
- `stack` now contains the second element of `result` followed by `num`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `max_seen` remains unchanged because the value of `num` was not used to update `max_seen` in this operation.

### Final Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the second element of result, stack contains the second element of result followed by num, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the maximum value seen so far.
```
```
remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the second element of result, stack contains the second element of result followed by num, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the maximum value seen so far.
```
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element and `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`, `stack` contains `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the second element of `result`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
