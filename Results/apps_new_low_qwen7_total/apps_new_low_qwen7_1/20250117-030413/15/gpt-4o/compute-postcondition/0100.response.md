Output State: **remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the third element of result, stack contains the third element of result, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, and max_seen is the second element of result.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `num` is undefined initially.
   - `stack` is an empty list.
   - `result` contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order followed by all elements from `remaining_numbers` in reverse order.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
   - `num` is set to the next element in `result` each time the loop iterates.
   - `stack` is modified by appending the current `num` to it.
   - `result` remains unchanged.
   - `max_seen` is updated when `num` is less than `max_seen`, but in the first iteration, `num` is the first element of `result`, and it cannot be less than `max_seen` (which is also undefined initially). After the first iteration, `max_seen` becomes the second element of `result`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `result`.
   - For the first iteration, `num` is the first element of `result`, and since there is no `max_seen` yet, the loop continues.
   - For the second iteration, `num` is the second element of `result`. If the second element is less than `max_seen` (which is undefined initially), the function returns -1 immediately. Otherwise, it updates `max_seen` and appends the second element to the stack.
   - For the third iteration, `num` is the third element of `result`. The loop checks if `num` is less than `max_seen`. If `max_seen` is the second element of `result`, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, then the loop appends `num` to the stack. If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - `remaining_numbers` remains an empty list.
   - `num` is the third element of `result`.
   - `stack` contains the third element of `result`.
   - `result` remains unchanged.
   - `max_seen` is the second element of `result`.

Thus, after the loop executes three times, the final state is as described.
