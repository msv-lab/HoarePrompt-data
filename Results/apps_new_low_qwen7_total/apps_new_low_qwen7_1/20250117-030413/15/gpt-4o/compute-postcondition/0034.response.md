The code `stack.append(num)` appends the variable `num` to the list `stack`. However, the value of `num` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact updated value of `stack`. The only information we can gather is that `num` is appended to an initially empty list.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one element (`num`), `max_seen` is the maximum value that was originally in the stack.**
