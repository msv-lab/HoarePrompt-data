To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list (`[]`).
- `num` is undefined (meaning it hasn't been assigned a value yet).
- `stack` is an empty list (`[]`).
- `result` contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order followed by all elements from `remaining_numbers` in reverse order.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the `num` variable, which is derived from the `result` list.
2. **Result List Structure**: `result` is composed of two parts:
   - All elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - All elements from `remaining_numbers` in reverse order.
3. **Empty `remaining_numbers`**: Since `remaining_numbers` is an empty list (`[]`), there are no elements from `remaining_numbers` in the `result` list.
4. **Non-empty `result`**: Even though `remaining_numbers` is empty, `result` still contains elements from `p` (which might be non-empty).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `result` must contain at least one element.
- Since `remaining_numbers` is empty, `result` must only contain elements from `p`.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- The loop will execute the first time if `result` is not empty.
- Since `result` contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `result` will be non-empty if `p` contains at least one element.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `result` must be a non-empty list containing elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `num` must be the first element of `result`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_numbers` is [], `num` must be the first element of `result`, `stack` is [], `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order**
