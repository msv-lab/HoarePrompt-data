The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `and` operator must be true:

1. The stack must not be empty (`stack`).
2. The last element of the stack must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`.
- `stack` is one element shorter than before.

To ensure the loop executes again, we need to ensure that:
1. `stack` is not empty.
2. The last element of `stack` (which is now the second-to-last element of the updated `stack`) is less than `num`.

Given the current state, `stack` is one element shorter, but we don't know what the new top element of the stack is. However, we know that the last element of the stack before the pop operation was `max_seen`. Therefore, the new top element of the stack must be less than `num` for the loop to continue.

So, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `stack` is not empty.
- Ensure the new top element of `stack` (second-to-last element of the updated `stack`) is less than `num`.

State: **`max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`, `stack` must not be empty, and the new top element of `stack` must be less than `num`**
