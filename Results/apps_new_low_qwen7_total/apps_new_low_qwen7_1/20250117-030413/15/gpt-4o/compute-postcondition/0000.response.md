The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `stack` and `max_seen`, both set to 0 or an empty list respectively. However, no operations are performed on these variables within the given code block. Therefore, the values of `stack` and `max_seen` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq k < n\), and `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range [1, n], the code does not modify any of these variables.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, p is a list of k integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range [1, n], stack is an empty list, max_seen is 0**
