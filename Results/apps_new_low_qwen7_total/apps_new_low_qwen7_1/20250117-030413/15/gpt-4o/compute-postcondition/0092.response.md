Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given States:
- `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
- `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element.
- `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by the current `num`.
- `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `max_seen` is the maximum value seen so far.
- If `num < max_seen`, the function returns -1, otherwise no change to the state of the variables.

### Loop Condition:
```
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Initial State of `stack`**:
   - `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by the current `num`.

3. **Initial State of `num`**:
   - `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `stack` must not be empty and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

### Ensuring `stack` is Not Empty:
- Since `stack` contains at least two elements (the second element of `result` and the current `num`), `stack` will always be non-empty in the first iteration.

### Ensuring `stack[-1] < num`:
- The last element of `stack` is the current `num` itself because `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by `num`.
- Therefore, `stack[-1]` is the same as `num`, and for the condition `stack[-1] < num` to be true, `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element and `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`, `stack` contains the second element of `result` followed by the current `num`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the maximum value seen so far, if `num < max_seen`, the function returns -1, otherwise no change to the state of the variables.**
