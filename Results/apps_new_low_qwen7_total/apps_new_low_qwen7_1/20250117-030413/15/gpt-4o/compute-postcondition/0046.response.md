Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for num in remaining_numbers:`. This means the loop variable is `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
   - `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack` contains the original elements plus `num` at the end.
   - `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_numbers` must still contain at least one element. If it does, the next `num` will be the first element of the updated `remaining_numbers`.

4. **Update States**:
   - `remaining_numbers` will now be the rest of the elements in the list (excluding the first element).
   - `num` will be the new first element of the updated `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack` will remain the same since no new elements are added or removed in the loop header.
   - `result` will remain the same since no new elements are popped from `stack` in the loop header.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The loop will continue as long as `remaining_numbers` contains at least one element. Therefore, the updated state should reflect the next iteration's conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains the original elements plus `num` at the end, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.**

Note: Since `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, the exact value of `num` cannot be specified without knowing the actual contents of `remaining_numbers`. However, we know that `num` is the first element of the remaining elements.
