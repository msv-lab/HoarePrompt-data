`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. This means `max_seen` now holds the value of the last element in the `stack`, and the `stack` loses this last element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of \(k-1\) integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` contains at least \(k-1\) elements (the last element is `max_seen`), `max_seen` is the value of the last element that was in the original `stack`**
