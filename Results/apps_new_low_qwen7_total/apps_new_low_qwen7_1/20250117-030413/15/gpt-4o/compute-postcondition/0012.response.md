The code appends the value of `num` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state where `num` is the first element of the list `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, the `stack` list will now contain this `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing one element `num`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was in the stack during the loop (which is now `num`), `num` is the first element of the list `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
