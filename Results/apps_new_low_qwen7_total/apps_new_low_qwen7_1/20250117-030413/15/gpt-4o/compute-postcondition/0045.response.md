The code snippet `stack.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the end of the list `stack`. This operation directly modifies the `stack` list by appending `num` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the impact:

- `remaining_numbers` is not affected.
- `num` is not affected.
- `stack` now has its last element as `num`.
- `result` is not affected.

Given the initial state:
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` contains elements that are all greater than or equal to `num` (or is empty), and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.

After executing the code snippet `stack.append(num)`, the new state is:
- `remaining_numbers` remains the same.
- `num` remains the same.
- `stack` now includes the original elements plus `num` at the end.
- `result` remains the same.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` contains the original elements plus `num` at the end, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.**
