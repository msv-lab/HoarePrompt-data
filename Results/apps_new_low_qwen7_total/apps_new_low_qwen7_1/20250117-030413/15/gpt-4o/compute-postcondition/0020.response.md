Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. This means the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `stack` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop head includes the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure both parts of the condition are true in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `stack` is currently a non-empty list with one less element. For the loop to continue, `stack` must still be non-empty and contain an element such that `stack[-1] < num`. Since `stack` is currently non-empty, we just need to ensure that `stack[-1] < num`.
   - `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack`, but this doesn't directly affect the loop condition in the next iteration. We only need to focus on `stack` and `num`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `stack` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `stack[-1]` must be less than `num`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`stack` is a non-empty list, `stack[-1]` is less than `num`**
