To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the loop continues as long as:
1. `stack` is not empty (`stack` is truthy).
2. The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

From the given information, we know:
- `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.
- `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
- `stack` contains at least one element (excluding the last element), and the last element of `stack` was less than `num` before the operation.
- After the operation, the last element of `stack` is removed, and `result` contains the last element of `stack` before the pop operation and the popped element.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied. Specifically:
1. `stack` must not be empty.
2. The last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Given that the last element of `stack` has just been removed, the only way for `stack` to still satisfy the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` is if there was an additional element in `stack` that was less than `num` before the last element was removed. Therefore, we need to ensure that the new last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- Ensure that `stack` still contains at least one element.
- Ensure that the new last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

Since `num` is fixed as the first element of `remaining_numbers`, and the last element of `stack` was less than `num` before the pop operation, we need to maintain this condition for the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least two elements, and the second last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.**
