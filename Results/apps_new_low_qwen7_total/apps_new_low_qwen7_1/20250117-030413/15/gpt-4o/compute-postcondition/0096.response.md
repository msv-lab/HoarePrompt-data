To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop head: `stack` and `stack[-1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `stack` contains the second element of `result`.
- `max_seen` is `num`, which is strictly greater than the second element of `result`.

After executing the code inside the loop:
- `stack` will be empty because the top element (second element of `result`) has been popped.
- `max_seen` will be updated to the value of the second element of `result`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `stack` should not be empty.
2. `stack[-1]` should be less than `num`.

Since `stack` is now empty, the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` will not be satisfied as `stack[-1]` is not defined (or could be interpreted as `None`). Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time based on the current state.

However, since the problem requires us to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that `stack` is not empty and `stack[-1]` is less than `num`.

Given that `stack` is empty, we need to ensure that it is not empty for the next iteration. We can achieve this by adding the second element of `result` back into the stack.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `stack` is empty, so we need to add the second element of `result` back into `stack` to make sure it is not empty.
2. Ensure that `num` is such that it can satisfy the condition `stack[-1] < num` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` is the next element in `result` after the second element and `num` must be strictly greater than the second element of `result`, `stack` contains the second element of `result`, `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the second element of `result`.**
