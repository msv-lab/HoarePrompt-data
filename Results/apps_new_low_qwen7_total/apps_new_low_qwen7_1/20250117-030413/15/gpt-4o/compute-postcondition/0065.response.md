Output State: **remaining_numbers is [], num is undefined, stack is [], result contains all elements from p in non-decreasing order followed by all elements from remaining_numbers in reverse order**

Explanation:
1. The first line `result.extend(reversed(stack))` appends all elements of the reversed `stack` to `result`. Since `stack` initially contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order followed by all elements from `remaining_numbers` in the order they were added, `result` now contains these elements in reverse order.
2. The second line `stack = []` clears the `stack`, making it an empty list.

Since `remaining_numbers` and `num` were part of the initial state but no operations were performed on them within the provided code block, their values remain unchanged. The `max_seen` variable is also not used or modified within the given code, so it retains its implicit value (which could be anything, but since it's not referenced, we consider it undefined in this context).
