Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

2. **Analyze the Variables Involved**:
   - `stack`: The loop checks if `stack` is not empty (`stack`) and if the last element of `stack` is less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).
   - `num`: This variable is compared against the last element of `stack`.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `remaining_numbers` is an empty list.
   - `num` must be the first element of `result`.
   - `stack` is an empty list.
   - `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

4. **Determine Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `stack` must not be empty. However, right before the loop, `stack` is an empty list.
   - Therefore, `stack` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - To make the loop execute, we need to add an element to `stack` such that `stack[-1] < num`.

Given the current state, the only way to satisfy the loop condition is to ensure that `stack` is non-empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_numbers` is an empty list, `num` must be the first element of `result`, `stack` must contain at least one element (and that element must be less than `num`), `result` contains elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**.
