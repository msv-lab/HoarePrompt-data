Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's analyze the effects of each line of code on the variables and lists involved.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\).
- `stack` is a list containing all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order.
- `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)
remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)
result = p[:]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)`**
   - `set(range(1, n + 1))` creates a set of all integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `set(p)` creates a set of all elements in the list `p`.
   - The subtraction operation (`-`) removes all elements of `set(p)` from `set(range(1, n + 1))`, leaving only the elements in `range(1, n + 1)` that are not in `p`.
   - The result is a set of integers that are missing from `p`.

2. **Line 2: `remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)`**
   - `sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)` sorts the set of remaining numbers in descending order.
   - The result is a list of integers in descending order, which are not present in `p`.

3. **Line 3: `result = p[:]`**
   - `p[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `p`.
   - `result` is assigned this copy, so now `result` is a list of the same elements as `p`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- `p` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- `stack` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- `max_seen` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- `remaining_numbers` is a new list containing the integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `p`, sorted in descending order.
- `result` is a copy of the list `p`.

### Output State:
Output State: **n is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), k is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), p is a list of k integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range [1, n], stack is a list containing all elements of p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the last element of the stack, remaining_numbers is a list of integers from 1 to n that are not in p, sorted in descending order, result is a copy of the list p**.
