The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the only element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Since the `stack` initially contains only one element `num`, after popping, `max_seen` will be assigned the value of `num`, and the `stack` will be empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is equal to `num`.**
