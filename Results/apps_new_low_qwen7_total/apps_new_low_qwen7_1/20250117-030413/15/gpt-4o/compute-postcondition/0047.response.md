Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

2. **Understand the variables involved**: 
   - `remaining_numbers`: This list must contain at least one element.
   - `num`: This is the first element of `remaining_numbers`.
   - `stack`: This contains the original elements plus `num` at the end.
   - `result`: This contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, two conditions must be met simultaneously:
     1. `stack` must not be empty (`stack` is a non-empty list).
     2. The last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) must be less than `num`.

4. **Determine the necessary state modifications**:
   - Since `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, and `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, this part is already satisfied.
   - To ensure `stack` is non-empty and its last element is less than `num`, we need to make sure that `stack` has at least one element and that the last element of `stack` is indeed less than `num`.

5. **Formulate the answer**:
   - The state of `remaining_numbers` is already valid as it must contain at least one element.
   - `num` being the first element of `remaining_numbers` is already ensured.
   - `stack` must contain at least one element, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Thus, the final state right before the loop that ensures the loop can execute the first time is:

State: **`remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `remaining_numbers`, `stack` must contain at least one element, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`**.
