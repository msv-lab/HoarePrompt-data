    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `p` is a list of `k` integers which are pairwise distinct and within the range \([1, n]\), `stack` is a list containing all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.
    #   - The condition `if num < max_seen` ensures the function returns `-1` immediately if any number in `p` is less than `max_seen`. However, based on the provided outputs, we assume no such number exists.
    #   - If the current `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, the loop continues and `max_seen` is updated to the popped value if the top of the stack is less than `num`. This ensures `max_seen` always contains the maximum value seen so far in the stack.
    #   - Finally, `num` is appended to the `stack`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `max_seen` is updated during each iteration but remains the highest value in the stack after the loop.
    #   - `stack` accumulates all elements from `p` in a way that it maintains non-decreasing order.
    #   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the input state.
    #   - `p` remains unchanged but its elements are processed.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop processes each element of `p` exactly once.
    #   - `stack` will contain all elements of `p` in a sorted manner, with `max_seen` being the last element in `stack`.
    #   - No element in `p` is less than `max_seen` after the loop, ensuring the loop can fully process `p`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - After processing all elements in `p`, `stack` will have all elements of `p` in non-decreasing order.
    #   - `max_seen` will be the largest value in `stack`, which is the last element of `stack`.
    #
    #Thus, after the loop completes, the `stack` will be a sorted list of `p`, and `max_seen` will be the largest value in this sorted list.
    remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)

remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)

result = p[:]
    for num in remaining_numbers:
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            result.append(stack.pop())
        
        stack.append(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_numbers` is [], `num` is the last element in the initial `remaining_numbers` list, `stack` contains all elements from `p` in non-decreasing order, followed by all elements from `remaining_numbers` in the order they were added, and `result` contains all elements that were popped from `stack` in reverse order.
    result.extend(reversed(stack))

stack = []

max_seen = 0
    for num in result:
        if num < max_seen:
            return -1
        
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            max_seen = stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: remaining_numbers is an empty list, num is the third element of result, stack contains the third element of result, result contains elements from p in non-decreasing order, and max_seen is the second element of result.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' which contains elements from 'p' in non-decreasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`, where `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, and `p` is a list of `k` distinct integers within the range `[1, n]`. The function first checks if any element in `p` is less than `max_seen`, a variable initialized to 0. If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `-1`. Otherwise, it proceeds to sort `p` in non-decreasing order using a stack and updates `max_seen` accordingly. Then, it calculates the remaining numbers not present in `p` and sorts them in descending order. It constructs a new list `result` by appending elements from `p` and `remaining_numbers` in a specific order, ensuring the final list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the final check using the stack also passes, the function returns the sorted list `result`; otherwise, it returns `-1`. The function aims to ensure that all elements in the final list are in non-decreasing order and that no element in the original `p` was less than `max_seen` throughout the process.
