The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers representing indices. The function returns the value of `(x * y) // gcd(x, y)`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, compute the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and return the result of `(x * y) // gcd(x, y)`.
