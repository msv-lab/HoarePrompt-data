You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the indices a and b respectively, and p and q are integers representing the number of chocolates Joty gets for painting a tile red and blue respectively. The values satisfy 1 ≤ x, y, p, q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    #`The program returns (x * y) // gcd(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers representing indices, and `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `x` and `y`, computes their greatest common divisor (gcd), and returns the value of `(x * y) // gcd(x, y)`. The function ensures that both `x` and `y` are positive integers within the range of \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). It handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be equal to 1, as the gcd in such cases would still be 1, and the result would be `x * y`. The function also correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are the same, resulting in a gcd of `x` or `y`, and the returned value being `x * y`. There are no apparent edge cases missed by the code, and the provided return postcondition accurately reflects the function’s behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of tiles that are painted both Red and Blue. Specifically, the calculation of `both_tiles` using the function `func_1(a, b)` is incorrect. The function `func_1` returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but the correct approach should be to use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to find the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`.

The correct formula for calculating the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b` should be:

\[ \text{both\_tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \right\rfloor \]

The current implementation uses LCM instead of GCD, which leads to an incorrect count of tiles that are painted both Red and Blue. This results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

For example, consider the input `n=10`, `a=2`, `b=3`, `p=5`, `q=7`. The correct output should be 34, but the program will produce an incorrect result due to the incorrect calculation of `both_tiles`.
