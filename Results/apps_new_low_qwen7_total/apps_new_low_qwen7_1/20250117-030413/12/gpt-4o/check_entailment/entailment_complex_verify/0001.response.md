### Reasoning:

1. **Identification of Tiles to Paint**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of tiles that need to be painted Red (`red_tiles`), Blue (`blue_tiles`), and both Red and Blue (`both_tiles`). However, the calculation for `both_tiles` is incorrect. Specifically, `both_tiles` should be calculated using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, not by calling `func_1` directly. The correct calculation is:
     ```python
     both_tiles = n // (a * b // gcd(a, b))
     ```
   - The function `func_1` is defined correctly and computes the LCM of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **Calculation of Maximum Chocolates**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of chocolates is:
     ```python
     max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the tiles painted both Red and Blue are not double-counted. If a tile is painted both Red and Blue, it should only be counted once in the total number of chocolates. This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Handling of Large Values**:
   - The program correctly handles large values by using a 64-bit integer type to store the result, ensuring that the calculations can handle the upper limit of \(10^9\) for `n`, `p`, and `q`.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete because it does not mention the error in the `both_tiles` calculation.
- The program needs to use the correct formula to compute `both_tiles`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the mistake in calculating `both_tiles`. The correct formula should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
