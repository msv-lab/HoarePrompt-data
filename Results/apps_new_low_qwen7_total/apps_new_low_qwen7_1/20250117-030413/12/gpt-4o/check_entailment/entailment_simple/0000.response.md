Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of tiles that will be painted red, blue, and both. We then compute the total number of chocolates Joty can get by maximizing the number of chocolates for the appropriate colors. 

1. The number of tiles painted red is given by `n // a`.
2. The number of tiles painted blue is given by `n // b`.
3. The number of tiles painted both (i.e., divisible by both `a` and `b`) is given by `n // gcd(a, b)`. This is calculated using the function `func_1`, which computes `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

The formula to maximize the chocolates is:
\[ \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q)) \]

This formula accounts for the fact that tiles painted both times have been double-counted (once in red\_tiles and once in blue\_tiles), so we subtract the minimum number of chocolates per tile (either p or q) to avoid double-counting.

The provided `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b` by using the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Given the logic and calculations in the annotated program, it correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
