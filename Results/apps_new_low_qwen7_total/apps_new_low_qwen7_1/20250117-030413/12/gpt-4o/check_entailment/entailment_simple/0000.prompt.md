Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

# Annotated Program:
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the indices a and b respectively, and p and q are integers representing the number of chocolates Joty gets for painting a tile red and blue respectively. The values satisfy 1 ≤ x, y, p, q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    #`The program returns (x * y) // gcd(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers representing indices, and `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
