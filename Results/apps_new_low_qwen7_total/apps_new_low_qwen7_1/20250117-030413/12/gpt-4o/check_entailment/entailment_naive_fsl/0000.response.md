Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of tiles that are painted both Red and Blue. Specifically, the calculation of `both_tiles` using the function `func_1(a, b)` is incorrect. The function `func_1` returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but the correct approach should be to use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to find the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`.

The correct formula for calculating the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b` should be:

\[ \text{both\_tiles} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \right\rfloor \]

The current implementation uses LCM instead of GCD, which leads to an incorrect count of tiles that are painted both Red and Blue. This results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

For example, consider the input `n=10`, `a=2`, `b=3`, `p=5`, `q=7`. The correct output should be 34, but the program will produce an incorrect result due to the incorrect calculation of `both_tiles`.
