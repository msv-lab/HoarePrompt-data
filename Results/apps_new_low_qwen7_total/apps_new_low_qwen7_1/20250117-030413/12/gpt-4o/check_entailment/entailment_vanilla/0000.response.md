Reasoning:
1. The given program correctly identifies the number of tiles that should be painted Red (`red_tiles`), Blue (`blue_tiles`), and both Red and Blue (`both_tiles`), which corresponds to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. The number of chocolates obtained by painting the tiles Red and Blue is calculated as `red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`. This subtraction ensures that the overlapping tiles (which are counted twice) are not double-counted.
4. The program uses a 64-bit integer type to store the result, which is necessary due to the potential large values of `n`, `p`, and `q`.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
