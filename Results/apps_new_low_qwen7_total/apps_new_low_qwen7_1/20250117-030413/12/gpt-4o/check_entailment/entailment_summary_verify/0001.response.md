### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `x` and `y` using the formula \(\text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)}\).
   - Given the constraints \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), the function handles all possible cases appropriately, including when `x` or `y` is 1 or when both `x` and `y` are the same.
   - The function `func_1` returns the expected LCM value, which is essential for calculating the number of tiles that can be painted both Red and Blue.

2. **Tile Count Calculation:**
   - The variables `red_tiles`, `blue_tiles`, and `both_tiles` are correctly computed:
     - `red_tiles = n // a`: Number of tiles divisible by `a` (and hence potentially painted Red).
     - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Number of tiles divisible by `b` (and hence potentially painted Blue).
     - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)`: Number of tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (LCM of `a` and `b`).

3. **Chocolates Calculation:**
   - The formula `max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)` correctly accounts for the overlap in counting tiles that are painted both Red and Blue.
   - This formula ensures that the overlapping tiles are not double-counted, leading to an accurate count of the total chocolates Joty can obtain.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large inputs effectively by using a 64-bit integer type to store the result, ensuring that it can handle the potential large values of `n`, `p`, and `q`.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
