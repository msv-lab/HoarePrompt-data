You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program:
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `x` and `y`, computes their greatest common divisor (gcd), and returns the value of `(x * y) // gcd(x, y)`. The function ensures that both `x` and `y` are positive integers within the range of \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). It handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be equal to 1, as the gcd in such cases would still be 1, and the result would be `x * y`. The function also correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are the same, resulting in a gcd of `x` or `y`, and the returned value being `x * y`. There are no apparent edge cases missed by the code, and the provided return postcondition accurately reflects the function’s behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The given program correctly identifies the number of tiles that should be painted Red (`red_tiles`), Blue (`blue_tiles`), and both Red and Blue (`both_tiles`), which corresponds to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. The number of chocolates obtained by painting the tiles Red and Blue is calculated as `red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`. This subtraction ensures that the overlapping tiles (which are counted twice) are not double-counted.
4. The program uses a 64-bit integer type to store the result, which is necessary due to the potential large values of `n`, `p`, and `q`.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution based on the problem description.
