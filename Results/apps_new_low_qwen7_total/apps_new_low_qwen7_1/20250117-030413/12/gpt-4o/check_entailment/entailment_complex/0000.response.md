### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining how to maximize the number of chocolates Joty can obtain by painting tiles based on their indices being divisible by certain numbers (`a` and `b`). Tiles that meet both criteria (divisible by both `a` and `b`) can be painted either red or blue, but the goal is to maximize the total chocolates obtained.

2. **Key Variables and Calculations**:
   - `red_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by `a` but not by `b`.
   - `blue_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by `b` but not by `a`.
   - `both_tiles`: Number of tiles divisible by both `a` and `b`.

3. **Chocolates Calculation**:
   - The formula used: `max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`.
     - `red_tiles * p` calculates the chocolates from tiles painted red.
     - `blue_tiles * q` calculates the chocolates from tiles painted blue.
     - Subtracting `both_tiles * min(p, q)` ensures that we do not double-count chocolates from tiles that can be painted either color.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` computes `(x * y) // gcd(x, y)`, which is correct for calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `x` and `y`.
   - This LCM is used to calculate the number of tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (`n // both_tiles`).

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The annotated program correctly follows the logic outlined above.
   - It uses the correct approach to compute the maximum number of chocolates without overcounting the tiles that can be painted either red or blue.

6. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The solution handles all provided constraints and conditions correctly.
   - The use of 64-bit integers ensures that the result can handle very large values up to \(10^9\).
