Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get based on the given rules.
2. The program correctly calculates the number of tiles that need to be painted red (`red_tiles`), blue (`blue_tiles`), and those that can be either color (`both_tiles`).
3. The function `func_1` correctly implements the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `x * y // gcd(x, y)`. This is used to determine the number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue (`both_tiles`).
4. The calculation of `max_chocolates` considers the correct formula: `red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`. This accounts for double-counting the tiles that can be either color and subtracts the minimum chocolates that can be obtained from painting these tiles either red or blue.
5. The use of `long long` (in C++) or `long` (in Java) for storing the result ensures that the large values can be handled without overflow issues.

Based on the above reasoning, the program logic is correct and follows the requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
