### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Variable Assignment:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values and assigns them to the variables \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), \( p \), and \( q \).

2. **Calculation of Tiles:**
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: This calculates the number of tiles that are multiples of \( a \).
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: This calculates the number of tiles that are multiples of \( b \).
   - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)`: This calculates the number of tiles that are multiples of both \( a \) and \( b \). The function `func_1` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

3. **Chocolates Calculation:**
   - The expression `max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)` calculates the total number of chocolates Joty can get. It correctly accounts for the double-counting of tiles that are multiples of both \( a \) and \( b \) by subtracting the chocolates corresponding to these tiles once.

4. **Type Consideration:**
   - The program uses `long long` for storing the result, which is appropriate given the constraints \( 1 \leq n, a, b, p, q \leq 10^9 \).

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the LCM of two numbers using the relationship between LCM and GCD. The formula used is correct and ensures that the calculation is accurate.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:

- The annotations correctly reflect the state of the program at key points and the logic behind the calculations.
- The logic for calculating the number of tiles and the chocolates is sound and matches the problem description.
- The subtraction in the chocolates calculation ensures that overlapping tiles are not double-counted.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the solution accurately based on the problem description.
