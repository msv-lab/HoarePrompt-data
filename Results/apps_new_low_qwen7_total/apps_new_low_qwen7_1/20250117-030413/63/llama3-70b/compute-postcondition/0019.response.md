The code `print('BitAryo')` simply prints the string 'BitAryo' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'BitAryo' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is either 2 or 3, and the length of list `a` is 1, each element in list `a` is non-negative and less than 300, and the minimum value of `a` is 0, and `a` is an empty list or all elements in `a` are truthy (non-zero), and 'BitAryo' is printed to the console.**
