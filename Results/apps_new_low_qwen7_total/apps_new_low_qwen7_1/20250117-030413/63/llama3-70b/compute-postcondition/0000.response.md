The initial state is defined such that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 3, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers each in the range of 0 to 299. 

The code block reads as follows:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This code block does the following:
1. It takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`.
2. It takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`.

Since no specific values for `n` and `a` are given in the problem statement, we will consider the general case where `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `a` will be a list of `n` integers. After running this code, `n` will hold the integer input and `a` will hold the list of integers input.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 300**
