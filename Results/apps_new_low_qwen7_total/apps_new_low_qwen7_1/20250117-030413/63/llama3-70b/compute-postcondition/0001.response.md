Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(0 \leq a_i < 300\).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `len(a) > 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Analyzing `a`**:
   - Since `a` is a list of `n` integers and `1 \leq n \leq 3`, the possible lengths of `a` are 1, 2, or 3.
   - To satisfy the condition `len(a) > 1`, `a` must have a length of either 2 or 3.

5. **Ensuring `len(a)` is Greater Than 1**:
   - If `n` is 1, then `len(a)` would be 1, and the loop would not execute.
   - Therefore, `n` must be either 2 or 3 to ensure `len(a)` is 2 or 3, respectively.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that controls the loop execution is `len(a)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
   - This means `n` must be either 2 or 3.

Thus, the modified state right before the loop should ensure that `n` is either 2 or 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be either 2 or 3**
