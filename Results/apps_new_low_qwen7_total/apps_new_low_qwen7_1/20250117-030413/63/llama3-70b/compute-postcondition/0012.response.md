`a.remove(0)` removes the first occurrence of `0` from the list `a`. However, since the initial state does not specify that `0` is in the list `a`, and the length of list `a` must be greater than 1, we can conclude that the removal operation might not affect the list `a` if `0` is not present. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 2 or 3; the length of list `a` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is either 2 or 3; the length of list `a` must be greater than 1**
