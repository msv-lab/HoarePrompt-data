Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `len(a) > 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is either 2 or 3.
   - The length of list `a` is greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `len(a) > 1`.
   - If `min(a)` equals 0, the postcondition remains as the precondition.
   - Otherwise, each element in list `a` is decreased by the minimum value of the original list `a`.

4. **Analyze the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.
   - Given that the length of `a` was greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that could change is if an element in `a` was reduced to 0, causing the length to become 1 or 0. However, the problem specifies that if `min(a)` equals 0, the postcondition remains as the precondition. This means that if `min(a)` was originally 0, the length of `a` should still be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of `a` remains greater than 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`, ensuring it remains greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is either 2 or 3, and the length of list `a` must be greater than 1**.
