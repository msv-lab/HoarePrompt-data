Postcondition: ***`n` is either 2 or 3, and the length of list `a` is 1. Each element in list `a` is non-negative and less than 300, and the minimum value of `a` is 0. If `a` is not an empty list, the program does not change the state of `a` or print anything. If `a` is an empty list or all elements in `a` are truthy (non-zero), 'BitAryo' is printed to the console.***
