Postcondition: ***`n` is either 2 or 3. If the first occurrence of 0 in the list `a` is removed, the postcondition remains as is. If the minimum value of the list `a` is 0 and all elements in `a` have been adjusted such that their minimum value is now 0, the postcondition also remains consistent with this adjustment.***
