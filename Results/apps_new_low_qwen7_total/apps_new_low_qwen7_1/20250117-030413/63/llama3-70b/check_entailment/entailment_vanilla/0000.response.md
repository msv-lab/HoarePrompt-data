Reasoning:
To determine if the provided solution correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner, let's break down the solution and compare it with the game rules:

1. **Game Rules Understanding**:
   - Players take turns.
   - A player can either:
     - Choose an element `a_i` and subtract any value from it as long as it remains non-negative.
     - Subtract the same value from all elements.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `n` and reads the array `a`.
   - It enters a loop where it repeatedly reduces elements until only one non-zero element remains or all elements are zero.
   - If all elements become zero, `BitAryo` wins (since no more moves can be made).
   - Otherwise, the last remaining element is checked for its parity (even or odd), and the winner is determined based on that.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the game ends with no elements left, leading to a loss for the current player (`BitAryo`).
   - However, the solution does not fully capture the game logic as per the rules. Specifically:
     - It does not handle the second type of move (subtracting the same value from all elements).
     - The loop condition should ensure that the game continues until no further moves can be made, not just when there is only one element left.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `[1, 1]`, the output is `BitLGM`, which is correct as BitLGM would win on the first move.
   - For the input `[1, 2]`, the output is `BitAryo`, which is correct as BitAryo would force a win on the second move.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 1]`, the output is `BitLGM`, which seems correct but might need verification since it does not explicitly check the second type of move.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While the solution provides correct outputs for some cases, it lacks the full implementation of the game logic, particularly the second type of move. The solution might fail in scenarios where the second type of move is crucial.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is questionable due to the incomplete implementation of the game rules.

Correctness: **False**
