Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the sequence `a` as per the input format.
2. **Removing Zeros**: The program removes all zeros from the list, which is a necessary step because zeros do not affect the game's outcome directly since a player can always choose to reduce other numbers.
3. **Adjusting Remaining Elements**: The program repeatedly reduces all elements by the smallest non-zero element until no further reduction is possible. This step ensures that the list contains at most one element.
4. **Determining Winner**: The program checks if there is any element left after the loop. If there is, it determines the winner based on whether the remaining element is even or odd:
   - If the remaining element is even, BitLGM wins.
   - If the remaining element is odd, BitAryo wins.
5. **Empty List Case**: If the list becomes empty during the process, the program correctly outputs 'BitAryo'.

Given the nature of the game, where players take turns to reduce numbers in specific ways, and the fact that the optimal strategy often involves parity (even or odd values), the logic implemented in the program aligns with the rules and objectives of the game.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the winner based on the given conditions and the optimal play strategy.

Correctness: **True**
