The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the length of the list `n` is between 1 and 3 (inclusive), and each integer in the list satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 300\). It then removes all zeros from the list and adjusts the remaining elements by subtracting the minimum non-zero value, ensuring that the list contains at most one element. After processing, the function prints 'BitLGM' if the single remaining element (if any) is even, and 'BitAryo' otherwise. If the list becomes empty during the process, it prints 'BitAryo'.
