Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates (or x-coordinates for east-west lines). This step is essential for identifying potential intersections.

2. **Collecting Unique Points**: The program collects unique x-coordinates from north-south lines and y-coordinates from east-west lines. This step ensures that only distinct boundary points are considered, which is crucial for forming the polygon.

3. **Checking Intersections**: The function `func_1` checks if two lines intersect. The core logic for determining the intersection point using the line intersection formula is correct. However, there is an issue with how the function handles the conditions for the intersection to be within both segments. The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` are necessary but not sufficient. They should be checked more rigorously to ensure the intersection point lies strictly within both segments.

4. **Calculating Area**: After collecting all boundary points, the program calculates the area of the polygon formed by these points using the shoelace formula. This part of the code is generally correct, assuming the points form a closed polygon.

5. **Handling Infinite Area**: The program correctly checks if the calculated area is zero and prints 'INF' if the area is infinite. This part is correct.

However, the function `func_1` has a critical flaw. The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` should be strictly enforced to ensure the intersection point lies within both segments. If an intersection point lies exactly on the boundary, it might not form a valid polygon, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the intersection point is strictly inside both segments, meaning `0 < t < 1` and `0 < u < 1`. The current implementation does not enforce this strict condition, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic is not fully correct due to the potential issue in the `func_1` function.

Final: **False**
