Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the region the cow can reach. Specifically, the program does not handle the intersection of the north-south and east-west lines properly. The function `func_1` is supposed to check if two lines intersect, but it only checks for intersection within the bounds of the segments. However, the program does not correctly determine the valid region the cow can reach based on these intersections.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 6
1 2 0
0 1 1
0 2 2
-3 4 -1
-2 6 3
1 0 1
0 1 2
2 0 2
-1 -4 5
3 -2 4
1 2 4
```

The output of the program is `13`, which is incorrect. The correct area should be `INF` because the segments create a bounded region that does not include the entire plane.

The program fails to account for the fact that the cow is restricted by the intersections of the north-south and east-west lines, which could create a bounded region. The program only adds points and calculates the area based on these points without properly determining the bounded region.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to identify the bounding box formed by the intersections of the north-south and east-west lines and then calculate the area of this bounding box. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
