Reasoning:

1. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their \(y\)-coordinates (or \(x\)-coordinates respectively).
   - It initializes sets `x_points` and `y_points` to store unique \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of the line segments' endpoints.

2. **Intersection Detection**:
   - The function `func_1` checks for intersection between a north-south line and an east-west line.
   - The logic for determining if two lines intersect is correct. The function uses the formula to find the intersection point and checks if this point lies within both line segments.

3. **Adding Points**:
   - After detecting intersections, the function adds relevant points to `x_points` and `y_points`.

4. **Calculating Area**:
   - The area calculation part is correct. It computes the area of the convex hull formed by the points in `x_points` and `y_points`.
   - The area is calculated using the Shoelace formula (or Gauss's area formula for polygons).

Given the sample input and output, the program seems to correctly identify the reachable area for the cow and compute the area accurately. The sorting and intersection detection logic appear to handle all necessary cases, including handling potential infinite areas by checking if the area is zero.

Correctness: **True**
