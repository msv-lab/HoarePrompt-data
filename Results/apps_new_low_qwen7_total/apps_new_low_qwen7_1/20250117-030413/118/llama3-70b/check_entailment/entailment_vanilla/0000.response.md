Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates (or x-coordinates for east-west lines).

2. **Collecting Unique Points**: The program collects unique x-coordinates from north-south lines and y-coordinates from east-west lines. This step ensures that only distinct boundary points are considered.

3. **Checking Intersections**: The function `func_1` checks if two lines intersect. It calculates the intersection point using the line intersection formula. However, there's an issue with how the function handles the conditions for the intersection to be within both segments. The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` should correctly check if the intersection point lies within the segment defined by the endpoints.

4. **Calculating Area**: After collecting all boundary points, the program calculates the area of the polygon formed by these points using the shoelace formula. This part of the code is generally correct, assuming the points form a closed polygon.

5. **Handling Infinite Area**: The program correctly checks if the calculated area is zero and prints 'INF' if the area is infinite.

Upon closer inspection, the issue lies in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the conditions used to check if the intersection point lies within the segment are not sufficient. The correct conditions should ensure that the intersection point is strictly within the segment, not just on the boundaries. However, since the problem statement guarantees that the point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments, the current implementation should work correctly under the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic appears to be sound under the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
