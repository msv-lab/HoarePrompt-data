Reasoning:

1. **Sorting and Data Collection**:
   - The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates, respectively.
   - It then collects unique x and y points where the line segments intersect or start/end.

2. **Intersection Check**:
   - The `func_1` function is designed to check if two line segments intersect.
   - It calculates the determinant (`denom`) to check if the lines are parallel.
   - If the lines are not parallel, it calculates `t` and `u` to check if the intersection lies within the bounds of both segments.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - While the function logic for checking intersection is correct, it only checks for intersection between the first line segments in each list. This means it does not consider all possible intersections between different line segments.
   - The function does not handle cases where the line segments might overlap but do not intersect at a single point.
   - The function does not account for vertical or horizontal segments correctly, which could lead to false negatives or positives.

Given these points, although the core logic for checking intersections is correct, the implementation does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it needs to check intersections between all pairs of line segments, not just the first ones.

Correctness: **False**
