### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates (or x-coordinates for east-west lines).

2. **Collecting Unique Points**: The program collects unique x-coordinates from north-south lines and y-coordinates from east-west lines. This step ensures that only distinct boundary points are considered.

3. **Checking Intersections**: The function `func_1` checks if two lines intersect. It calculates the intersection point using the line intersection formula. The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` are used to determine if the intersection point lies within the segment defined by the endpoints. These conditions are correct because they ensure that the intersection point is strictly within the segment, not just on the boundaries.

4. **Calculating Area**: After collecting all boundary points, the program calculates the area of the polygon formed by these points using the shoelace formula. This part of the code is generally correct, assuming the points form a closed polygon.

5. **Handling Infinite Area**: The program correctly checks if the calculated area is zero and prints 'INF' if the area is infinite.

### Key Points:
- The sorting step ensures that the lines are processed in the correct order.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks for intersections, ensuring that the intersection point is within the segment.
- The area calculation using the shoelace formula is correct for the collected points.
- The handling of the infinite area condition is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is logically sound under the given constraints. The function `func_1` handles the intersection check appropriately, and the rest of the program follows a valid approach to solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
