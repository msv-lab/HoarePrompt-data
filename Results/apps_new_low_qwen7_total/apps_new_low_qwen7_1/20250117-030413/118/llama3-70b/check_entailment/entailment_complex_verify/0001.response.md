### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates (or x-coordinates for east-west lines). This is essential for correctly identifying the boundaries of the region the cow can reach.

2. **Collecting Unique Points**: The program collects unique x-coordinates from north-south lines and y-coordinates from east-west lines. This step ensures that only distinct boundary points are considered, which is crucial for calculating the area accurately.

3. **Checking Intersections**: The function `func_1` checks if two lines intersect. It calculates the intersection point using the line intersection formula. However, there is an issue with how the function handles the conditions for the intersection to be within both segments. The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` should correctly check if the intersection point lies strictly within the segment defined by the endpoints. Given that the problem statement guarantees the point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments, the current implementation might still work correctly under the provided constraints. Nevertheless, the conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` do not explicitly exclude the endpoints, which means the intersection point could be on the boundary, leading to potential inaccuracies.

4. **Calculating Area**: After collecting all boundary points, the program calculates the area of the polygon formed by these points using the shoelace formula. This part of the code is generally correct, assuming the points form a closed polygon.

5. **Handling Infinite Area**: The program correctly checks if the calculated area is zero and prints 'INF' if the area is infinite. This ensures that the program behaves as expected in the case where the cow can move indefinitely.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:

- **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
  - The function `func_1` aims to determine if two line segments intersect.
  - The function uses the line intersection formula and correctly calculates the parameters `t` and `u`.
  - The conditions `0 <= t <= 1` and `0 <= u <= 1` are intended to ensure that the intersection point lies strictly within both segments.
  - However, the conditions do not explicitly exclude the endpoints, which could lead to the intersection being on the boundary rather than strictly within the segments.

### Conclusion:

While the overall logic of the program seems sound and meets the requirements of the problem, there is a potential issue with the `func_1` function's conditions for checking if the intersection point lies within both segments. Since the conditions do not explicitly exclude the endpoints, the program might incorrectly identify some segments as intersecting when they are actually just touching at an endpoint.

Given this potential issue, the program's behavior may not be fully correct, even though it might produce the right output under the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

This conclusion is based on the fact that the conditions in `func_1` do not strictly enforce that the intersection point must lie within the segments, potentially leading to incorrect results.
