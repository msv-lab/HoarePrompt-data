You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is a grass field that stretches infinitely.
In this field, there is a negligibly small cow. Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\ \mathrm{cm} south and y\ \mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).
There are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
What is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9  (inclusive).
 - 1 \leq N, M \leq 1000
 - A_i < B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)
 - E_j < F_j\ (1 \leq j \leq M)
 - The point (0, 0) does not lie on any of the given segments.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_N B_N C_N
D_1 E_1 F_1
:
D_M E_M F_M

-----Output-----
If the area of the region the cow can reach is infinite, print INF; otherwise, print an integer representing the area in \mathrm{cm^2}.
(Under the constraints, it can be proved that the area of the region is always an integer if it is not infinite.)

-----Sample Input-----
5 6
1 2 0
0 1 1
0 2 2
-3 4 -1
-2 6 3
1 0 1
0 1 2
2 0 2
-1 -4 5
3 -2 4
1 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
13

The area of the region the cow can reach is 13\ \mathrm{cm^2}.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(line1, line2):
```
