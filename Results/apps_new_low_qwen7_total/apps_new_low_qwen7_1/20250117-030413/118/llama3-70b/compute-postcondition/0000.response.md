Initial State: `line1` is a list of tuples, each representing a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i), and `line2` is a list of tuples, each representing an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j).

Code Block:
```
x1, y1, x2 = line1
x3, y3, x4 = line2
denom = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4)
```

Analysis:
- The first line unpacks the first tuple in `line1` into `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`.
- The second line unpacks the first tuple in `line2` into `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`.
- The third line calculates the value of `denom` using the formula provided.

Since the initial values of `line1` and `line2` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `denom`. However, we can state that `denom` is calculated based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`.

Output State: **line1 is a list of tuples, each representing a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i), line2 is a list of tuples, each representing an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j), x1 is the first element of the first tuple in line1, y1 is the second element of the first tuple in line1, x2 is the third element of the first tuple in line1, x3 is the first element of the first tuple in line2, y3 is the second element of the first tuple in line2, x4 is the third element of the first tuple in line2, denom is the calculated value of (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4)**
