You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: line1 is a list of tuples, each representing a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i), and line2 is a list of tuples, each representing an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j).
def func_1(line1, line2):
    x1, y1, x2 = line1

x3, y3, x4 = line2

denom = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4)
    if (denom == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: line1 is a list of tuples, each representing a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i), line2 is a list of tuples, each representing an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j), x1 is the first element of the first tuple in line1, y1 is the second element of the first tuple in line1, x2 is the third element of the first tuple in line1, x3 is the first element of the first tuple in line2, y3 is the second element of the first tuple in line2, x4 is the third element of the first tuple in line2, denom is the calculated value of (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4), and denom is not equal to 0
    t = ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom

u = -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom
    if (0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= u <= 1) :
        return True
        #True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: line1 is a list of tuples, line2 is a list of tuples, x1 is the first element of the first tuple in line1, y1 is the second element of the first tuple in line1, x2 is the third element of the first tuple in line1, x3 is the first element of the first tuple in line2, y3 is the second element of the first tuple in line2, x4 is the third element of the first tuple in line2, t is ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom, u is -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom, and denom is the calculated value of (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4), with denom not equal to 0. Additionally, either \( t \) is less than 0, \( t \) is greater than 1, \( u \) is less than 0, or \( u \) is greater than 1.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. `line1` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i). `line2` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j).
#
#- **Case_1**: The program returns `False`.
#- **Case_2**: The program returns `True`.
#- **Case_3**: The program returns `False`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of line segments, one for north-south lines and one for east-west lines, and return either `True` or `False` based on certain conditions that are not detailed here.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: True

Case_3: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
