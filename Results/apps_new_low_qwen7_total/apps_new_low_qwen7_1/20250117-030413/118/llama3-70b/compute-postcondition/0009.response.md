The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. `line1` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment with three integers (A_i, B_i, C_i). `line2` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment with three integers (D_j, E_j, F_j).

- **Case_1**: The program returns `False`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of line segments, one for north-south lines and one for east-west lines, and return either `True` or `False` based on certain conditions that are not detailed here.
