The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and returns `False`. This is because for any integer `x` in the given range, the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` will never result in `0`. This is due to the fact that `x` and `x + 1` are consecutive integers, and their binary representations differ by exactly one bit, which is set to `1` in `x` and `0` in `x + 1`. Therefore, their bitwise AND will always have at least one bit set to `1`, making the result non-zero. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code since the logic correctly reflects the intended behavior.
