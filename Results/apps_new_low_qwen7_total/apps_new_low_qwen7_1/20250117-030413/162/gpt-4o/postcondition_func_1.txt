- The provided annotations and code do not mention any specific handling for the case when `x` becomes 2. In reality, if `x` becomes 2, the `operations` list should also be `[0]` because 2 has only one set bit at position 1, and the loop would have already processed this. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this scenario. Therefore, the `operations` list might incorrectly show `[0, 1, 0]` even if `x` is 2.
