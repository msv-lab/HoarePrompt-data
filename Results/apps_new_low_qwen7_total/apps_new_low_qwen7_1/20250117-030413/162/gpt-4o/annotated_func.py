#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False because there is no integer x in the range 1 to 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and returns `False`. This is because for any integer `x` in the given range, the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` will never result in `0`. This is due to the fact that `x` and `x + 1` are consecutive integers, and their binary representations differ by exactly one bit, which is set to `1` in `x` and `0` in `x + 1`. Therefore, their bitwise AND will always have at least one bit set to `1`, making the result non-zero. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code since the logic correctly reflects the intended behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6.
def func_2(x):
    operations = []

count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is either 1 or 2; `count` is 40; `operations` is [0, 1, 0] if `x` is 1, otherwise `operations` is [0]; `n` is 0.
    return count, operations
    #`count` is 40, `operations` is [0, 1, 0] if x is 1, otherwise [0]
#Overall this is what the function does:- The provided annotations and code do not mention any specific handling for the case when `x` becomes 2. In reality, if `x` becomes 2, the `operations` list should also be `[0]` because 2 has only one set bit at position 1, and the loop would have already processed this. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this scenario. Therefore, the `operations` list might incorrectly show `[0, 1, 0]` even if `x` is 2.
