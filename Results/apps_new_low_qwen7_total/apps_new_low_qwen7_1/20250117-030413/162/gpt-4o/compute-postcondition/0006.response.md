Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << n) - 1 <= x`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `count` is even (this state does not affect the loop condition).

3. **Determine the new value of `n` for the loop to execute again**:
   - The current value of `n` is 1.
   - To check if the loop can execute again, we need to evaluate the condition with `n = 2`.
   - Substituting `n = 2` into the condition, we get `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `3` must be less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Check the condition**:
   - Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `x` is at least 3 for the loop to continue.
   - The values of `n` and `count` do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `x` is at least 3, `n` is 1, and `count` is even**.
