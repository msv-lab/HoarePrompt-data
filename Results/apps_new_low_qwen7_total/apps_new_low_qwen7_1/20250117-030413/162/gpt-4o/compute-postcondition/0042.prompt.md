You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } n > 0 \text{ and } x \gg (n - 1) \& 1 == 1 \]

This means the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0 and the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1.

### Track Variable Changes
- **n**: This variable decreases by 1 each time the loop condition is satisfied.
- **x**: The value of `x` remains unchanged within the loop. The loop only modifies `n`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to decrement `n` until either `n` becomes 0 or the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` becomes 0. 

Given the outputs after specific numbers of iterations:
- After 1 iteration: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1 \) and the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1.
- After 2 iterations: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 2 \) (assuming the \((n-2)\)-th bit was also set).
- After 3 iterations: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 3 \) (assuming the \((n-3)\)-th bit was also set).

### Final Values
The loop will continue until \( n \leq 0 \). At this point, the loop terminates.

- If \( n \leq 0 \), the loop stops.
- If \( x \) had multiple bits set to 1 from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0, then \( n \) will reach 0 exactly when the leftmost set bit in `x` is reached.
- Otherwise, if no more bits are set, \( n \) will eventually become 0 due to the loop condition failing.

### Verify Relationships
The relationships and invariants we derived are consistent with the described iterations:
- The \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` being set to 1 ensures the loop runs.
- Once the leftmost set bit is reached, the loop stops.

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the loop exits when \( n \leq 0 \). This happens when:
- All bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0.
- Alternatively, the loop simply exits if \( n \) reaches 0 before all bits are checked.

Therefore, the final state is:
\[ \text{Output State: } n = 0 \text{ and all bits from } \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1 \text{ down to 0 in } x \text{ are 0.} \]
if condition:
```
if (n == 0):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
