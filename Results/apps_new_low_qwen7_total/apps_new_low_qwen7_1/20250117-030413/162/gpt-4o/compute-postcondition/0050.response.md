Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `not func_1(x)` and `count < 40`.

2. **Analyze the current state**: 
   - `count` is either odd or even.
   - `x` is either 1 or 0.
   - `operations` is either `[0]` or remains `[0]` (since the value of `operations` does not affect the loop condition).

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `func_1(x)` and `count`.
   - We need to ensure that `not func_1(x)` is still true and `count < 40` is still valid for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust `count`**:
   - Since `count` is either odd or even, and the loop will continue as long as `count < 40`, we need to increment `count` to be less than 40.
   - The simplest way to ensure this is to set `count` to 39 (the largest number less than 40).

5. **Adjust `x`**:
   - `x` can be either 1 or 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(x)` must return False.
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(x)` returns False for the next iteration.
   - Since we don't know the exact behavior of `func_1`, we assume that setting `x` to 1 will make `func_1(x)` return False (assuming `func_1(1)` is False based on typical programming logic).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to set `count` to 39 and `x` to 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`count` is 39, `x` is 1, `operations` is [0]**
