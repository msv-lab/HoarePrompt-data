You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } n > 0 \text{ and } x \gg (n - 1) \& 1 == 1 \]

This means the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0 and the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1.

### Track Variable Changes
- **n**: This variable decreases by 1 each time the loop condition is satisfied.
- **x**: The value of `x` remains unchanged within the loop. The loop only modifies `n`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to decrement `n` until either `n` becomes 0 or the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` becomes 0. 

Given the outputs after specific numbers of iterations:
- After 1 iteration: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1 \) and the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1.
- After 2 iterations: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 2 \) (assuming the \((n-2)\)-th bit was also set).
- After 3 iterations: \( n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 3 \) (assuming the \((n-3)\)-th bit was also set).

### Final Values
The loop will continue until \( n \leq 0 \). At this point, the loop terminates.

- If \( n \leq 0 \), the loop stops.
- If \( x \) had multiple bits set to 1 from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0, then \( n \) will reach 0 exactly when the leftmost set bit in `x` is reached.
- Otherwise, if no more bits are set, \( n \) will eventually become 0 due to the loop condition failing.

### Verify Relationships
The relationships and invariants we derived are consistent with the described iterations:
- The \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` being set to 1 ensures the loop runs.
- Once the leftmost set bit is reached, the loop stops.

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the loop exits when \( n \leq 0 \). This happens when:
- All bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0.
- Alternatively, the loop simply exits if \( n \) reaches 0 before all bits are checked.

Therefore, the final state is:
\[ \text{Output State: } n = 0 \text{ and all bits from } \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1 \text{ down to 0 in } x \text{ are 0.} \]
Program Fragment:
```
if n == 0:

```
if part: `n` is 0, all bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
else part: None

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
