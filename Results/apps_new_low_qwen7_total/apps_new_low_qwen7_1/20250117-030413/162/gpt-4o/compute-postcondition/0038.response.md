`n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 0 initially, after decrementing by 1, `n` will be greater than -1 (but not zero because the initial state specifies it must be greater than 0). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1**
