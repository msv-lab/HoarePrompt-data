Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `func_1(x)` and `count`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `not func_1(x)` (which means `func_1(x)` returns `False`) and `count < 40`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `count` must be less than 40.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - `operations` is an empty list (this doesn't affect the loop condition).
   - `count` is initially 0.

4. **Determine the Conditions for the First Iteration**:
   - Since `count` starts at 0, the condition `count < 40` is always true when the loop starts.
   - Therefore, the critical part is ensuring that `not func_1(x)` is true, meaning `func_1(x)` should return `False`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `func_1(x)` must return `False` when `x` is evaluated.
   - The value of `x` itself does not matter as long as it is within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).

Thus, the state right before the loop must ensure that `func_1(x)` returns `False`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` must return `False`**, `operations` is an empty list, `count` is 0.
