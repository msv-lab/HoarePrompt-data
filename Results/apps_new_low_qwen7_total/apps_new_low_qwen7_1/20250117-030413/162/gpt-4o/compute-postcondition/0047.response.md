`count` is an integer, and `count` is odd. The code increments `x` by 1. Since the value of `x` was not specified initially, we can only say that `x` is increased by 1. The value of `count` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`count` is an integer, and `count` is odd; `x` is increased by 1**
