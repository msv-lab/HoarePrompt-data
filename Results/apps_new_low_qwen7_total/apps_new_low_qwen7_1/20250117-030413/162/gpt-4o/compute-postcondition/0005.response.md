The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The condition that `func_1(x)` returns `False` is still valid. The value of `count` remains even as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `n` is 1, and `count` is even**
