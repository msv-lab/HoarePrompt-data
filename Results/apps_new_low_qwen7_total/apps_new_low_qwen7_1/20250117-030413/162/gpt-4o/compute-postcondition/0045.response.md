The initial state is defined such that `n` is 0 and all bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0. Given that `n` is 0, let's analyze the provided code snippet:

```python
operations.append(n)
x ^= (1 << n) - 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Line: `operations.append(n)`**
   - `operations` is a list (which is not defined in the initial state, so it must be a new list).
   - `n` is 0.
   - Appending `n` (which is 0) to `operations` means `operations` now contains `[0]`.

2. **Second Line: `x ^= (1 << n) - 1`**
   - `n` is 0, so `(1 << n) - 1` evaluates to \( (1 << 0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \).
   - Therefore, `x ^= 0` does not change the value of `x`.
   - Since all bits in `x` were initially 0, this operation does not alter `x`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains 0.
- `x` remains 0.
- `operations` is now `[0]`.

Output State: **n is 0, x is 0, operations is [0]**
