Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). It performs a series of operations based on the value of `x` and maintains a list of operations performed. The function runs a loop up to 40 iterations, where it alternates between two operations: 

1. If the iteration count is even, it calculates the highest set bit position in `x` using bitwise operations, appends this position to the `operations` list, and updates `x` by toggling all bits up to this position.
2. If the iteration count is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1.

After the loop, the function returns a tuple consisting of `count`, which is always 40, and `operations`, which is `[0, 1, 0]` if `x` is 1 after the loop, otherwise `[0]`.

This function effectively manipulates the value of `x` through bitwise operations and records these operations in the `operations` list. The final state of `x` determines the exact content of the `operations` list returned.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is initially 1, the function will run 40 iterations and the `operations` list will contain `[0, 1, 0]` because the highest set bit is 0 (indicating no higher set bits), then the next operation increments `x` by 1, and the process repeats.
- If `x` is not 1 initially, the function will still run 40 iterations, but since `x` is incremented by 1 in each odd iteration, the `operations` list will eventually become `[0]` because no further set bits will be found.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided annotations and code do not mention any specific handling for the case when `x` becomes 2. In reality, if `x` becomes 2, the `operations` list should also be `[0]` because 2 has only one set bit at position 1, and the loop would have already processed this. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this scenario. Therefore, the `operations` list might incorrectly show `[0, 1, 0]` even if `x` is 2.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code, including all potential edge cases and identified missing functionality.
