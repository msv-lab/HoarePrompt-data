Let's analyze the given Python loop and track the changes in the variable `n` based on the provided information.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } (1 << n) - 1 \leq x \]

### Track Variable Changes
1. **Variable `n`**: This is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
2. **Variable `x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged inside the loop. It only influences the loop's termination condition.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop starts with `n = 0`.
- In each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1 as long as the condition \((1 << n) - 1 \leq x\) holds true.
- The expression \(1 << n\) is equivalent to \(2^n\), so the condition can be rewritten as \(2^n - 1 \leq x\).

### Verify Relationships
- After 1 iteration, `n` becomes 1, and \(x \geq 0\).
- After 2 iterations, `n` becomes 3, and \(x \geq 0\).
- After 3 iterations, `n` becomes 4, and \(x \geq 7\).

From this pattern, we can generalize:
- After `k` iterations, \(n = k + 1\), and \(x \geq 2^k - 1\).

### Determine the Final Values
To find the final state after the loop completes all its iterations, consider the point where the condition no longer holds:
\[ 2^n - 1 > x \]

Since `n` is incremented until the condition fails, the final value of `n` will be the smallest integer such that:
\[ 2^n - 1 > x \]
This means:
\[ 2^n > x + 1 \]
Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:
\[ n > \log_2(x + 1) \]

Therefore, the final value of `n` will be:
\[ n = \lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil \]

### Final Output State
- The variable `x` remains unchanged and is only constrained by the inequality \(x \geq 0\).
- The final value of `n` is \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil\).

Output State: **`n` is \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil\) and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
