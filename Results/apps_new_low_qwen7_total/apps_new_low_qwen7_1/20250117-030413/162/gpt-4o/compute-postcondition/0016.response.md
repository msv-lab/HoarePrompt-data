`n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 17 to 16. The 20th and 16th bits of `x` being 1 does not change, and the value of `x` itself remains unchanged within the given range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and the 20th bit of `x` is 1, `n` is 16, and the 16th bit of `x` must be 1**
