The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that a loop or a series of conditional statements has been exited. Given the initial state where `n` is 0 and all bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, all bits from \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\) down to 0 in `x` are 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
