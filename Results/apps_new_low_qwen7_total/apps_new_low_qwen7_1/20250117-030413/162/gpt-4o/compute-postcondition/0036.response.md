`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is equal to the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of \(x + 1\), and the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1. After decrementing `n` by 1, the new value of `n` is one less than its original value. The \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` being set to 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is \(\lceil \log_2(x + 1) \rceil - 1\); the \((n-1)\)-th bit of `x` is set to 1**
