The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is part of the list `operations`, which was [0]. After incrementing `n` by 1, the new value of `n` is 1 + 0 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is 39, `x` is 1, `operations` is [0, 1], `n` is 1**
