The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. The function returns two values: `count`, which is an integer with a fixed value of 40, and `operations`, which is a list with a fixed value of [0, 1, 0] if `x` is 1, otherwise [0]. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` within the specified range and return a tuple containing the integer 40 and either the list [0, 1, 0] or [0] depending on whether `x` is 1 or not.
