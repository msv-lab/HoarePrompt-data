The code initializes `n` to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `x`. The function `func_1(x)` returns `False`, which means the value of `x` is still within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and does not affect the count being even.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `n` is 0, and `count` is even.**
