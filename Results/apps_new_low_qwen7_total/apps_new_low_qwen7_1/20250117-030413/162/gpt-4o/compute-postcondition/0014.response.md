`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 18, so after decrementing, `n` becomes 17. The values of `x` and its bits remain unchanged because the code only affects `n`. Therefore, the 20th bit of `x` is still 1, and the 19th bit of `x` is still 1.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), the 20th bit of `x` is 1, `n` is 17, and the 19th bit of `x` is 1**
