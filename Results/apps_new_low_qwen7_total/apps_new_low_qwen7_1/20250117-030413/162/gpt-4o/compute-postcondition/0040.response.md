`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1. After decrementing, `n` is now one less than its original value and still greater than 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and it must still have the nth bit (where n is the new value of `n`) set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2; `x` must have the nth bit set to 1 where n is `n` - 1**
