`x` is incremented by 1. The initial state says that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, and `count` is not even. After incrementing `x` by 1, the new value of `x` will still satisfy \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). Also, since `func_1(x)` returns `False` and there is no operation on `count` in the given code snippet, `count` remains unchanged and is still not even.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `count` is not even**
