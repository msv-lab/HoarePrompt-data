The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Given that the initial value of `n` is 1, after executing this line of code, `n` will be 2.

The other variables (`x` and `count`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is at least 3, `n` is 2, and `count` is even**.
