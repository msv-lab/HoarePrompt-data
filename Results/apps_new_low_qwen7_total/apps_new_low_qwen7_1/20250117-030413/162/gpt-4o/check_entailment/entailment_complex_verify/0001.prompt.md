You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.

-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    operations = []
    count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        count += 1
    return (count, operations)



- Annotated Code: 
x = int(input())
(t, ops) = func_2(x)
print(t)
for i in range(0, len(ops), 2):
    print(ops[i], end=' ')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False because there is no integer x in the range 1 to 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and returns `False`. This is because for any integer `x` in the given range, the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` will never result in `0`. This is due to the fact that `x` and `x + 1` are consecutive integers, and their binary representations differ by exactly one bit, which is set to `1` in `x` and `0` in `x + 1`. Therefore, their bitwise AND will always have at least one bit set to `1`, making the result non-zero. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code since the logic correctly reflects the intended behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6.
def func_2(x):
    operations = []

count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is either 1 or 2; `count` is 40; `operations` is [0, 1, 0] if `x` is 1, otherwise `operations` is [0]; `n` is 0.
    return count, operations
    #`count` is 40, `operations` is [0, 1, 0] if x is 1, otherwise [0]
#Overall this is what the function does:- The provided annotations and code do not mention any specific handling for the case when `x` becomes 2. In reality, if `x` becomes 2, the `operations` list should also be `[0]` because 2 has only one set bit at position 1, and the loop would have already processed this. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this scenario. Therefore, the `operations` list might incorrectly show `[0, 1, 0]` even if `x` is 2.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic and behavior of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function checks if `x & x + 1 == 0`.
   - This condition holds true if and only if all bits in `x` are set to 0 after the last 1-bit. In other words, `x` must be a power of 2 minus 1 (i.e., `2^k - 1` for some non-negative integer `k`). This is because `x & (x + 1)` effectively clears the lowest set bit of `x` and sets the next lower bit to 1, which will be zero if `x` is `2^k - 1`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function aims to transform the input `x` into a perfect longcat (`2^m - 1`) using at most 40 operations.
   - The operations alternate between two types:
     - Operation A: Replace `x` with `x ^ (2^n - 1)`, where `n` is chosen such that `(2^n - 1) <= x`.
     - Operation B: Replace `x` with `x + 1`.
   - The function uses a loop to perform these operations up to 40 times, ensuring that the conditions of alternating operations are met.

Here is the step-by-step validation of the logic:

- **Initial Check:** `func_1(x)` is used to check if `x` is already a perfect longcat. If it is, the function returns immediately with 0 operations.
- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop continues until either `x` becomes a perfect longcat or the maximum number of operations (40) is reached.
  - Inside the loop, an odd-indexed operation uses `func_1` to find the highest bit position `n` such that `(2^n - 1) <= x`. This ensures that `x` is reduced to a form where the next operation (adding 1) can potentially make it a perfect longcat.
  - An even-indexed operation increments `x` by 1.
  - The loop continues to alternate between these operations.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided solution correctly implements the Cat Furrier Transform as described in the problem statement. The function `func_2` ensures that the operations are performed in the correct sequence and within the allowed limit of 40 operations.
