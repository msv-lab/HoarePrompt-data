You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
39

Output
4
5 3 
Input
1

Output
0

Input
7

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    operations = []
    count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        count += 1
    return (count, operations)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : - The provided annotations and code do not mention any specific handling for the case when `x` becomes 2. In reality, if `x` becomes 2, the `operations` list should also be `[0]` because 2 has only one set bit at position 1, and the loop would have already processed this. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this scenario. Therefore, the `operations` list might incorrectly show `[0, 1, 0]` even if `x` is 2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to attempt to transform the input number \( x \) into a perfect longcat using the specified operations. However, the logic within `func_1` and the main loop in `func_2` do not correctly implement the required transformations. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(x):
       return x & x + 1 == 0
   ```
   This function checks if \( x \) is a power of 2 minus 1, which is not the same as checking if \( x \) is a perfect longcat (i.e., \( 2^m - 1 \)). Instead, it checks if \( x \) is a power of 2, which is incorrect.

2. **Main Loop in `func_2`:**
   ```python
   while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
       if count % 2 == 0:
           n = 0
           while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
               n += 1
           while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
               n -= 1
           if n == 0:
               break
           operations.append(n)
           x ^= (1 << n) - 1
       else:
           x += 1
       count += 1
   ```
   - The loop incorrectly calculates \( n \) by finding the highest bit set in \( x \). This is not necessary for transforming \( x \) into a perfect longcat.
   - The XOR operation \( x ^= (1 << n) - 1 \) is not correctly applied to transform \( x \) into a perfect longcat.
   - The logic for incrementing \( x \) by 1 (when \( count \% 2 == 1 \)) is also flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly transform the input number \( x \) into a perfect longcat for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
