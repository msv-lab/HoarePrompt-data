Reasoning: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify if it aligns with the problem statement and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves calculating the expected number of dresses after one year, considering the wardrobe doubles the number of dresses each month and then possibly eats one dress with 50% probability.
   - The result must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function efficiently computes \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - It is correct and necessary for the subsequent calculations involving powers.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function checks if \(x == 0\). If true, it returns 0, which is correct.
   - For \(x > 0\), it computes \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the expected number of dresses as \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Verification of `func_2`**:
   - The formula \(2^{k+1}\) correctly models the doubling effect over \(k+1\) months.
   - The term \((2^{k+1} - 1)\) accounts for the expected reduction due to the 50% probability of eating one dress each month.
   - Multiplying by \(x\) and applying the modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

Given that the function summaries match the provided implementation and the logic is sound, the program should correctly calculate the expected number of dresses.

However, let's consider the edge case and general logic further:

- For \(x = 0\), the function returns 0, which is correct.
- For \(x > 0\), the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) correctly models the expected value considering the doubling and potential loss of one dress.

Upon re-evaluation, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement and the function summaries.

Final: **True**
