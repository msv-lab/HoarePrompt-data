Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected number of dresses after one year (k+1 months) considering the wardrobe's doubling and potential halving of dresses each month, except the last one.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function implements modular exponentiation, which efficiently calculates \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\).
   - It correctly handles edge cases like when the base is 1 or the exponent is 0.
   - The function returns the correct value of \((base^{exponent}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the expected number of dresses after k+1 months.
   - It checks if the initial number of dresses (`x`) is 0, returning 0 in that case.
   - For non-zero `x`, it uses the `func_1` function to calculate \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which represents the number of dresses after doubling each month.
   - It then calculates \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), representing the expected number of dresses after accounting for the wardrobe potentially eating one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last month).

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Both functions are logically sound and handle the given constraints correctly.
   - The `func_1` function correctly performs modular exponentiation.
   - The `func_2` function correctly applies the logic for calculating the expected number of dresses.

Based on the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
