Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for the wardrobe eating one of the dresses with 50% probability at the end of each month except the last one. 

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

- For the input `(x=2, k=0)`, the output should be `4`. This is correct as no doubling and no wardrobe eating occur.
- For the input `(x=2, k=1)`, the output should be `7`. Here is the detailed breakdown:
  - After the first month, the number of dresses becomes \(2 \times 2 = 4\). With 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 3 dresses; with 50% probability, it leaves 4 dresses.
  - At the end of the year, we double the number of dresses again:
    - With 50% probability, we start with 3 dresses, doubling to 6, and then with 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 5 dresses.
    - With 50% probability, we start with 4 dresses, doubling to 8, and then with 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 7 dresses.
  - Therefore, the expected number of dresses is \((5 + 7) / 2 = 6\). However, the program incorrectly calculates the expected value without considering the wardrobe eating probability.

The program needs to incorporate the wardrobe eating probability at the end of each month (except the last one) to compute the expected number of dresses correctly.
