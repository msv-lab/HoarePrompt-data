### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Doubling and Reduction**: At the end of each month, the number of dresses doubles, and then with a 50% probability, one dress is eaten.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The final result must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **Initial Values**: \(x\) is the initial number of dresses, and \(k+1\) is the number of months in a year.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **func_1(base, exponent, mod)**:
   - This function computes \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\).
   - It uses the efficient method of exponentiation by squaring, which is correct and efficient for large exponents.

2. **func_2(x, k)**:
   - This function calculates the expected number of dresses after one year.
   - It starts by checking if \(x == 0\). If true, it returns 0, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the number of dresses at the end of the year using the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Analysis of func_2:
- The formula \(2^{k+1}\) represents the doubling effect over \(k+1\) months.
- The term \((2^{k+1} - 1)\) accounts for the expected value of dresses after doubling and potentially losing one dress each month.
- Multiplying by \(x\) gives the expected number of dresses initially, then taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within the required range.

### Verification:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case when \(x == 0\).
2. **Formula Accuracy**: The formula used in `func_2` correctly models the expected value after accounting for the doubling and the random loss of one dress with 50% probability.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and ensures the result is an integer.

Given that all parts of the code accurately reflect the problem statement and the provided functions are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description.
