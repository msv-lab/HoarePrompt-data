Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the exponentiation by squaring algorithm to calculate \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\).
   - It handles edge cases appropriately, ensuring the result is always within the modulo range.
   - The logic and implementation of this function seem accurate.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function checks if `x` is 0. If true, it returns 0, which is correct as the expected number of dresses would be 0.
   - If `x` is not 0, it calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the expected number of dresses as \(x \cdot (power - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - The logic follows the problem statement accurately:
     - Doubling the dresses \(k+1\) times gives \(2^{k+1}\) dresses before the wardrobe eats one with 50% probability each month.
     - The expected number of dresses after \(k\) months is \(\frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{2}\).

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the input values \(x\) and \(k\) and calls `func_2(x, k)` to compute the expected number of dresses.
   - The output is printed, and the result is calculated correctly based on the provided logic.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions implement the required logic accurately and handle all necessary edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
