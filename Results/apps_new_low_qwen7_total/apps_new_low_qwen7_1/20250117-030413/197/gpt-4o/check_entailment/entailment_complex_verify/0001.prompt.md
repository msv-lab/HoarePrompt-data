You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)
    result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
(x, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(x, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod
        
        exponent //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: base is 1, exponent is 0, result is \(base^{initial\ exponent} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
    return result
    #The program returns 1, since base is 1 and exponent is 0, \(1^0 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates `(base^exponent) % mod` using an efficient algorithm known as "exponentiation by squaring." This method reduces the number of multiplications required compared to the naive approach. The function iteratively squares the base and multiplies it to the result when the current exponent bit is 1. The modulus operation `% mod` is applied at each step to prevent overflow. The function returns the final result, which is the value of `(base^exponent) % mod`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If `base` is 1 and `exponent` is any non-negative integer, the result is always 1 because \(1^n = 1\) for any \(n\).
- If `exponent` is 0, the result is 1 regardless of the `base` value, as \(b^0 = 1\) for any \(b\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- The variable `result` holds the value of \((base^{exponent}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The variables `base` and `exponent` are no longer used after the function returns.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7. x is not equal to 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integers `x` and `k` with the constraints \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). It returns 0 if `x` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates `power` as \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), then computes and returns \(x \cdot (power - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The function covers all cases where `x` can be 0 or any positive integer within the given range, and correctly applies the modulo operation throughout its calculations to ensure the result fits within the specified bounds.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Doubling and Reduction**: At the end of each month, the number of dresses doubles, and then with a 50% probability, one dress is eaten.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The final result must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **Initial Values**: \(x\) is the initial number of dresses, and \(k+1\) is the number of months in a year.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **func_1(base, exponent, mod)**:
   - This function computes \((base^{exponent}) \mod mod\).
   - It uses the efficient method of exponentiation by squaring, which is correct and efficient for large exponents.

2. **func_2(x, k)**:
   - This function calculates the expected number of dresses after one year.
   - It starts by checking if \(x == 0\). If true, it returns 0, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it computes the number of dresses at the end of the year using the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Analysis of func_2:
- The formula \(2^{k+1}\) represents the doubling effect over \(k+1\) months.
- The term \((2^{k+1} - 1)\) accounts for the expected value of dresses after doubling and potentially losing one dress each month.
- Multiplying by \(x\) gives the expected number of dresses initially, then taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within the required range.

### Verification:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case when \(x == 0\).
2. **Formula Accuracy**: The formula used in `func_2` correctly models the expected value after accounting for the doubling and the random loss of one dress with 50% probability.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and ensures the result is an integer.

Given that all parts of the code accurately reflect the problem statement and the provided functions are implemented correctly, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description.
