You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)
    result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
(x, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(x, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod
        
        exponent //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: base is 1, exponent is 0, result is \(base^{initial\ exponent} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
    return result
    #The program returns 1, since base is 1 and exponent is 0, \(1^0 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1\)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7. x is not equal to 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for the wardrobe eating one of the dresses with 50% probability at the end of each month except the last one. 

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

- For the input `(x=2, k=0)`, the output should be `4`. This is correct as no doubling and no wardrobe eating occur.
- For the input `(x=2, k=1)`, the output should be `7`. Here is the detailed breakdown:
  - After the first month, the number of dresses becomes \(2 \times 2 = 4\). With 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 3 dresses; with 50% probability, it leaves 4 dresses.
  - At the end of the year, we double the number of dresses again:
    - With 50% probability, we start with 3 dresses, doubling to 6, and then with 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 5 dresses.
    - With 50% probability, we start with 4 dresses, doubling to 8, and then with 50% probability, the wardrobe eats one dress, leaving 7 dresses.
  - Therefore, the expected number of dresses is \((5 + 7) / 2 = 6\). However, the program incorrectly calculates the expected value without considering the wardrobe eating probability.

The program needs to incorporate the wardrobe eating probability at the end of each month (except the last one) to compute the expected number of dresses correctly.
