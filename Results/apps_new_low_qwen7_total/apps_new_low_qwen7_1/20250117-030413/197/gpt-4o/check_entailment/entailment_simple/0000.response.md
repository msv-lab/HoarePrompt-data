Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates \( \text{base}^{\text{exponent}} \mod \text{mod} \) using a fast exponentiation method (also known as exponentiation by squaring). The logic is correct, and it returns the expected value correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `x` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. This handles the trivial case correctly.
   - **Recursive Doubling and Modulo**: The function uses `func_1` to calculate \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\). This represents the number of dresses after \(k+1\) months without considering the wardrobe eating the dress. 
   - **Adjusting for Wardrobe Eating**: The formula used is \( x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7) \). Here's why this works:
     - \(2^{k+1}\) gives the total number of dresses after \(k+1\) months if no dress is eaten.
     - Since the wardrobe eats one dress with 50% probability each month (except the last one), we need to account for the expected reduction. The term \((2^{k+1} - 1)\) accounts for the fact that the wardrobe could potentially eat a dress each month (on average).

The logic here is sound. However, there's a potential issue with the final modulo operation:
- The expression `x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD` is redundant because the modulo operation `% MOD` is already applied within the function `func_1`. Therefore, the second `% MOD` is unnecessary and could be removed for clarity.

Given these points, the overall logic of the program is correct. The calculations and the use of modulo operations are appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
