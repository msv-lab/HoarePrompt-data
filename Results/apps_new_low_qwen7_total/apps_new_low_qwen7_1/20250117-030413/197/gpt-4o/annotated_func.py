#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a non-negative integer, exponent is a non-negative integer, and mod is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        
        base = base * base % mod
        
        exponent //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: base is 1, exponent is 0, result is \(base^{initial\ exponent} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
    return result
    #The program returns 1, since base is 1 and exponent is 0, \(1^0 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates `(base^exponent) % mod` using an efficient algorithm known as "exponentiation by squaring." This method reduces the number of multiplications required compared to the naive approach. The function iteratively squares the base and multiplies it to the result when the current exponent bit is 1. The modulus operation `% mod` is applied at each step to prevent overflow. The function returns the final result, which is the value of `(base^exponent) % mod`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If `base` is 1 and `exponent` is any non-negative integer, the result is always 1 because \(1^n = 1\) for any \(n\).
- If `exponent` is 0, the result is 1 regardless of the `base` value, as \(b^0 = 1\) for any \(b\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- The variable `result` holds the value of \((base^{exponent}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The variables `base` and `exponent` are no longer used after the function returns.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(x, k):
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, and MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7. x is not equal to 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)

result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integers `x` and `k` with the constraints \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). It returns 0 if `x` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates `power` as \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), then computes and returns \(x \cdot (power - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The function covers all cases where `x` can be 0 or any positive integer within the given range, and correctly applies the modulo operation throughout its calculations to ensure the result fits within the specified bounds.
