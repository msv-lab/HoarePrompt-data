The given code block performs the following operations:

1. It calculates the power of 2 raised to \(k + 1\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and assigns the result to the variable `power`.
2. It computes the result as `x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD`.

Let's break down these operations:

### Step 1: Calculate Power
The function call `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)` computes \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\). Let's denote this computed value as `power`.

### Step 2: Compute Result
The expression `x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD` simplifies to `x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` because taking the modulus twice with the same number does not change the result. Here, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), and `power` is the previously calculated value of \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Since `power` is the result of \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), we can represent it as `power = 2^(k+1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

Thus, the result is `x * (2^(k+1) % (10^9 + 7) - 1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Final Output State
- The variable `x` retains its original value.
- The variable `k` retains its original value.
- The variable `MOD` retains its original value.
- The variable `power` is updated to the value of \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The variable `result` is set to `x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

Output State: **x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^18, MOD is 10^9 + 7, power is 2^(k+1) % (10^9 + 7), result is x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)**
