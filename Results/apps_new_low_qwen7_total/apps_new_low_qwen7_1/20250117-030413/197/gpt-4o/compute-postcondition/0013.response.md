Given the initial state and the code block, let's analyze the effects of the code on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `base` is \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\)
- `exponent` is greater than 0
- `result` is updated based on the condition `if exponent % 2 == 1`, then `result` is \((result * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\). Otherwise, `result` remains unchanged.

### Code Block:
```python
base = base * base % mod
exponent //= 2
```

#### Line 1: `base = base * base % mod`
- This line updates the value of `base` to be \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\).
- This is consistent with the initial state where `base` is already defined as \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Line 2: `exponent //= 2`
- This line updates the value of `exponent` by performing integer division by 2.
- It reduces the value of `exponent` by half.

### Final State Analysis:
- The value of `base` remains as \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\), which is already set initially.
- The value of `exponent` is reduced by half.

Since no changes are made to `result` in the given code block, it retains its initial value based on the condition specified.

### Output State:
- `base` remains \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\)
- `exponent` is now \( \text{original exponent} // 2 \)
- `result` remains unchanged based on the initial condition

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **base is \((base * base) \% (10^9 + 7)\), exponent is original exponent // 2, result is updated as per initial condition**
