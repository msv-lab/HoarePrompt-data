Postcondition: **`base` is a non-negative integer squared modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `exponent` is greater than \(0\), and `result` is updated to `(result * base) % (10^9 + 7)` if `exponent % 2 == 1`. If `exponent % 2 != 1`, `result` remains unchanged as `base % (10^9 + 7)` if the current exponent is odd, otherwise `result` remains at `10^9 + 7`.**
