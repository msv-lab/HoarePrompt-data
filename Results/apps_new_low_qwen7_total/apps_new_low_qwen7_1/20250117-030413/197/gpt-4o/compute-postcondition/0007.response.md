The code `result = result * base % mod` multiplies the current value of `result` by `base` and then takes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Since `base` is a non-negative integer squared modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and `result` equals `base % mod` if the current exponent is odd, otherwise `result` remains \(10^9 + 7\), we need to consider these conditions.

- If the current exponent is odd, `result` is initially `base % mod`.
- If the current exponent is even, `result` is initially \(10^9 + 7\).

In both cases, `result` is updated by multiplying it with `base` and taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This means the new value of `result` will be `(result * base) % mod`.

Output State: **`base` is a non-negative integer squared modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `exponent` is greater than \(0\), `result` is `(result * base) % mod`**
