The loop head consists of the variable `exponent`. The loop condition is `exponent > 0`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `exponent` is positive. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `exponent` is reduced by half (`exponent = exponent // 2`), for the loop to execute one more time, `exponent` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `exponent` is greater than 0.

State: **`base` is (base * base) % (10^9 + 7), `exponent` must be greater than 0, `result` is base % (10^9 + 7) if exponent was odd before the operation, otherwise result is (result * base) % (10^9 + 7) if exponent became odd after the operation, otherwise result is 10^9 + 7**
