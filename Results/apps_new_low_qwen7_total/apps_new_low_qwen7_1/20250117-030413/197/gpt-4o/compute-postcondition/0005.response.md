The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `k`. Both `x` and `k` are integers. The constraints are that `0 <= x <= 10^18` and `0 <= k <= 10^18`. The function returns 0 in Case_1 and returns `x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `x` and `k`, and return 0 or `x * (power - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` based on the value of `k`.
