The code snippet updates the `result` variable by multiplying it with `base` and taking modulo `(10^9 + 7)`. Given the initial state:

- `base` is `(base * base) % (10^9 + 7)`
- `exponent` must be greater than 0
- `result` is `base % (10^9 + 7)` if `exponent` was odd before the operation, otherwise it is `(result * base) % (10^9 + 7)` if `exponent` became odd after the operation, otherwise it is `10^9 + 7`

The `result` variable is updated to `result * base % (10^9 + 7)`. Since no specific values are given for `base` and `result`, the changes are expressed in terms of their relationships.

Output State: **`base` is `(base * base) % (10^9 + 7)`, `exponent` is greater than 0, `result` is `(result * base) % (10^9 + 7)`**
