Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two integers `x` and `k` with the constraints \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). It returns 0 if `x` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates `power` as \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), then computes and returns \(x \cdot (power - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The function covers all cases where `x` can be 0 or any positive integer within the given range, and correctly applies the modulo operation throughout its calculations to ensure the result fits within the specified bounds.**
