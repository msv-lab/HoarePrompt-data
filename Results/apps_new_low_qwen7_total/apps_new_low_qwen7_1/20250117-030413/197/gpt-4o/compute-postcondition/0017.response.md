Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. It calculates `(base^exponent) % mod` using an efficient algorithm known as "exponentiation by squaring." This method reduces the number of multiplications required compared to the naive approach. The function iteratively squares the base and multiplies it to the result when the current exponent bit is 1. The modulus operation `% mod` is applied at each step to prevent overflow. The function returns the final result, which is the value of `(base^exponent) % mod`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If `base` is 1 and `exponent` is any non-negative integer, the result is always 1 because \(1^n = 1\) for any \(n\).
- If `exponent` is 0, the result is 1 regardless of the `base` value, as \(b^0 = 1\) for any \(b\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- The variable `result` holds the value of \((base^{exponent}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- The variables `base` and `exponent` are no longer used after the function returns.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the handling of edge cases and the final state of the program after the function execution.
