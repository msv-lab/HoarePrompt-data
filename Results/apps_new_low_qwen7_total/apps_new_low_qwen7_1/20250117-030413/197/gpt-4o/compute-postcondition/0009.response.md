Output State: **base is (base * base) % (10^9 + 7), exponent is exponent // 2, result is base % (10^9 + 7) if exponent was odd before the operation, otherwise result is (result * base) % (10^9 + 7) if exponent became odd after the operation, otherwise result is 10^9 + 7**

Explanation:
1. The first line updates `base` to `(base * base) % (10^9 + 7)`. This squares the current value of `base` and takes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. The second line performs an integer division of `exponent` by 2, updating it to `exponent // 2`.

The final state includes the new value of `base` after squaring and taking the modulo, the new value of `exponent` after halving, and the updated `result` based on the conditions provided.
