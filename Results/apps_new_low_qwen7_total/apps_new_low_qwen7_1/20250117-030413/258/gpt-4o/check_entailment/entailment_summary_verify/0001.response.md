### Reasoning:

The original assessment is generally accurate in its analysis, but there are a few points that need further clarification and validation:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` aims to check the feasibility of a given threshold `T` for a pair of meats. The logic inside `func_1` is indeed complex, and it involves geometric calculations to determine if a hypothetical heat source placed at a specific point can make a certain number of pieces of meat ready. However, the current implementation might not cover all edge cases, particularly when considering the global optimum. For example, the calculation of the potential heat source position might not always yield the correct global minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.

2. **Binary Search in `func_2`**: The binary search implemented in `func_2` is standard and should work correctly to find the minimum time required. The function correctly sets the initial bounds and iteratively refines the search until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-7`.

3. **Reading Input in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it into the required format, and uses `func_2` to find the answer.

Given these points, let's validate the original assessment step-by-step:

- **Feasibility Check in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to check the feasibility of a given time threshold `T` for a pair of meats. It calculates the distance and hardness ratio to determine if the given time `T` is sufficient for the pieces of meat to be ready. While the logic seems correct, the global optimization aspect might not be fully covered by this function alone.

- **Binary Search in `func_2`**: The binary search implementation in `func_2` is robust and should converge to the correct minimum time. However, the initial bounds (`0` and `10^9`) are quite wide, which might affect the convergence speed. Given the constraints, this should be fine, but it is worth noting that the search space could be optimized further.

- **Reading Input in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` reads the input correctly and passes it to `func_2` for processing. This part is straightforward and correct.

To validate the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that the `func_1` function correctly handles all edge cases and provides a valid global optimum. Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, the current implementation should work well, but there is a small risk of edge cases being missed.

### Conclusion:

While the overall structure of the code is logically sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements, there is a minor risk that the `func_1` function might not cover all edge cases optimally. However, given the standard approach and the problem constraints, the current implementation should produce the expected results for the majority of cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is structured correctly and should produce the expected results for the given constraints and problem description, despite the potential edge cases not being fully covered by the `func_1` function.
