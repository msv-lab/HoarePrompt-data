### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step using the given function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if a given temperature `T` makes at least `K` pieces of meat ready.
- It iterates over all pairs of meats, calculates the midpoint between them, and determines if the midpoint is a valid heat source for the given temperature `T`.
- The logic is flawed because it only considers pairs of meats and does not ensure that the chosen position is globally optimal. This means it might miss the true optimal position by focusing solely on pairs.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
- It calls `func_1` with progressively refined temperatures until the difference between `low` and `high` is less than `1e-07`.
- While `func_2` seems to use a binary search approach, the correctness of the result depends heavily on the accuracy of `func_1`.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads input values for `N` and `K` and constructs a list of tuples `meats`.
- It then calls `func_2` with the constructed list and prints the result.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and Construction (`func_3`)**:
   - The function correctly reads input values and constructs the list of meats.
   - This part is correct and adheres to the problem statement.

2. **Binary Search (`func_2`)**:
   - The binary search approach is sound in principle; it aims to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
   - However, the success of this approach hinges on the correctness of `func_1`.

3. **Pairwise Optimization (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks pairs of meats and uses the midpoint as a potential heat source.
   - This method might not find the global optimum because it only considers pairwise distances and does not explore all possible positions.
   - The problem requires finding the globally optimal heat source position, not just the best among pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. While the binary search approach in `func_2` is correct in structure, the `func_1` function's heuristic of checking pairs only might not find the global minimum. Therefore, the program cannot guarantee the correct solution for every potential case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
