You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function reads input values for `N` and `K` from standard input, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat and `K` is an integer constraint. It then constructs a list of tuples `meats`, each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of each piece of meat. The function calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input types or out-of-bound values for `N` and `K`. If the input types are incorrect (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or `K`), the program may fail to execute correctly. The function assumes valid input within the specified constraints (1 <= K <= N <= 60).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of three functions:

1. `func_1`: This function checks if a given threshold `T` allows a set of `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready using a hypothetical heat source placed at the calculated center of mass of any pair of meats that meet certain conditions. However, this function is not the primary solver for the problem. It appears to be a helper function for binary search or a feasibility check.

2. `func_2`: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. It repeatedly calls `func_1` with a midpoint value to determine whether it's feasible to have `K` or more pieces ready in that time. 

3. `func_3`: This function reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to find and print the result.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` is complex but seems to be checking the feasibility of a certain time threshold `T` for a pair of meats. The logic inside this function involves some geometric calculations and comparisons. However, it is not clear if `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases, especially for determining the optimal heat source position.
  
- The binary search implementation in `func_2` is standard and correctly sets up the initial bounds (`0` and `10^9`) and iteratively refines the search until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-7`. This ensures that the solution is accurate to within the required precision.

- `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it, and uses the binary search to find the answer.

### Conclusion:

While the overall structure of the code is logically sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements, there are a few points to consider:

1. The `func_1` function may not handle all edge cases optimally. Specifically, the logic for calculating the potential heat source position might not always yield the correct global optimum.
2. Given the complexity of the problem, a more robust approach might be needed to ensure correctness, such as verifying the logic in `func_1` thoroughly or using a different method to calculate the optimal heat source position.

However, based on the provided information and the standard approach used, the current implementation should work correctly for the given constraints and problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is structured correctly and should produce the expected results for the given constraints and problem description.
