Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
- `func_1` is designed to check if a given time threshold `T` allows `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready when the heat source is optimally placed between any two pieces of meat. This function uses a pairwise comparison strategy to find a feasible solution.
- `func_2` employs a binary search approach to iteratively narrow down the optimal time threshold `T` that satisfies the condition of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. It repeatedly calls `func_1` to make this determination.
- `func_3` reads input from standard input, processes it into a format that can be used by `func_2`, and then outputs the result.

Each function appears to handle its part of the problem correctly:
- `func_1` correctly evaluates if there exists a midpoint position that satisfies the condition for a given `T`.
- `func_2` correctly applies binary search to find the minimum `T` that meets the condition using `func_1`.
- `func_3` correctly reads the input and formats it to pass to `func_2`, then outputs the result with the required precision.

Given the structure and purpose of each function, and the fact that they collectively solve the problem as described, the overall program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
