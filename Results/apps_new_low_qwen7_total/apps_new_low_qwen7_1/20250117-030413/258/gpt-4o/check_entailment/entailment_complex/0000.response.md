Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function aims to check if there exists a point such that at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled within a certain time threshold `T`. The function correctly iterates through all pairs of pieces of meat and calculates the midpoint and distance considering their hardness. However, the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when the list of meats is empty or when `K` exceeds the number of pieces of meat. These cases need to be handled to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time threshold such that at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled. The function correctly applies the binary search and uses `func_1` to determine if a given threshold is feasible. The logic of updating `low` and `high` based on the return value of `func_1` is correct. However, the function assumes that `func_1` will eventually return `True` for some threshold, which might not be true if the input data does not allow any solution. The function also assumes that the solution is within the range `[0, 1000000000.0]`, which is a reasonable assumption given the constraints.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function reads input from the standard input, constructs the list of meats, and calls `func_2` to find the minimum time threshold. The input handling and construction of the `meats` list are correct. The printing of the result formatted to six decimal places is also correct.

Given that:
- Function 1 (`func_1`) does not handle all edge cases but still works for the provided problem statement.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly implements the binary search and uses `func_1` appropriately.
- Function 3 (`func_3`) correctly reads and processes the input and calls the other functions.

The overall implementation meets the problem requirements and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
