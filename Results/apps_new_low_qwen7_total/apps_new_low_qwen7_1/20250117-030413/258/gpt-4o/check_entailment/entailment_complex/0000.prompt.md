Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat. K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a non-negative float representing the time threshold.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]

            my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)
            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `N`, `j` is `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d` is 0, `cx` is 0, `cy` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0, `mx` is 0, `count` is 0.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`. It iterates through all pairs of pieces of meat in the `meats` list and calculates the distance and angle between them based on their hardness and time threshold `T`. For each pair, it checks if the number of pieces of meat within a certain distance from the calculated midpoint is greater than or equal to `K`. If such a pair is found, the function returns `True`. If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the list of meats is empty, the function should return `False`.
- When `K` is greater than the number of pieces of meat, the function should return `False` because it's impossible to find `K` or more pieces of meat within the given conditions.

Missing functionality:
- The current implementation assumes that the list `meats` is not empty and that `K` is less than or equal to the length of `meats`. However, the function should handle these edge cases explicitly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 60; meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) and hardness c_i of a piece of meat, and -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, and all (x_i, y_i) are unique.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low`, `high`, and `mid` are floating-point numbers. `low` and `high` converge to the same value within a precision of 1e-07. `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`. The exact values of `low` and `high` depend on the evaluations of `func_1(meats, K, mid)` over the iterations.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which converges to the same value as low within a precision of 1e-07
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and hardness \(c_i\) of a piece of meat, with the conditions \(-1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq 100\), and all \((x_i, y_i)\) are unique.

The function uses a binary search approach to find a specific value within a range. Initially, the range is set from 0 to 1000000000.0. The function iterates until the difference between `low` and `high` is less than \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). In each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.

The function then calls another function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` to evaluate whether a certain condition related to the `meats` list and the current midpoint value `mid` is met. If the condition is met, it means that `mid` is potentially too high, so `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `mid` is considered too low, and `low` is updated to `mid`.

After the loop terminates, `high` is returned, which converges to the same value as `low` within a precision of \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). This final value represents a threshold or boundary condition related to the `meats` list and the parameters `N` and `K`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the list `meats` is empty, the function will return `high` as 0 since no valid `mid` can satisfy the condition in `func_1`.
- If `func_1` always returns `False`, `low` will eventually converge to 0, and `high` will also be 0.
- If `func_1` always returns `True`, `high` will converge to the initial upper bound of 1000000000.0.

The function ensures that the returned value is precise up to \(1 \times 10^{-7}\), making it suitable for scenarios where a high degree of accuracy is required.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60. meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x, y, c) representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness c of the i-th piece of meat.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])

K = int(data[1])

meats = []

index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is 2, K is 2, index is 9, meats is \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300), (data[4], data[5], data[6]), (data[7], data[8], data[9])]\).
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)

print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `N` and `K` from standard input, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat and `K` is an integer constraint. It then constructs a list of tuples `meats`, each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of each piece of meat. The function calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input types or out-of-bound values for `N` and `K`. If the input types are incorrect (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or `K`), the program may fail to execute correctly. The function assumes valid input within the specified constraints (1 <= K <= N <= 60).
