### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the annotated version to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function is supposed to check if a given temperature `T` would make a certain number of pieces of meat ready. It iterates over all pairs of meats and calculates the positions `mx` and `my` for each pair. Then it checks if placing the heat source at `(mx, my)` would make `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Sorting and Swapping**: The function sorts and swaps the hardness values and coordinates of the meats to ensure `c1 * T >= c2 * T`. This is correct but the subsequent calculations are incorrect.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The calculation of `d` and the subsequent distance conditions are incorrect. The condition `d * d2 > d2` is always true since `d` is calculated as `c1 * T - c2 * T` and `d2` is always positive. This leads to unnecessary calculations and incorrect results.
3. **Heat Source Position Calculation**: The positions `mx` and `my` are calculated using a complex formula that does not necessarily lead to the optimal heat source position. The formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` and `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` is derived under incorrect assumptions and does not guarantee finding the optimal position.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function performs a binary search on the temperature `T` to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the binary search is dependent on the correctness of `func_1`, which, as we've established, is incorrect. The binary search algorithm itself is correct, but the input to `func_1` is incorrect.

#### Function `func_3`:
This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to get the result. The input reading logic seems correct, but the reliance on `func_1` and `func_2` means that the overall program is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described because it uses an incorrect heuristic approach to determine the heat source position. The binary search in `func_2` is dependent on the incorrect logic in `func_1`, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

**Final: False**
