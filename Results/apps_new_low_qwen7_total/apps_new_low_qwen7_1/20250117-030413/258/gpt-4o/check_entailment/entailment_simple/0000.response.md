Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum time required to grill at least \(K\) pieces of meat out of \(N\) pieces, by placing a heat source optimally. The time to grill a piece of meat is determined by the distance between the heat source and the piece of meat, scaled by the hardness of the meat.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the input and parses it into a list of tuples `(x, y, c)`.
   - It uses binary search (`func_2`) to find the minimum time `T` required to grill at least `K` pieces of meat.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, it calls `func_1` to check if it's possible to grill at least `K` pieces of meat within time `mid`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if there exists a point `(X, Y)` such that at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled within time `T = mid`.
   - It iterates over all pairs of meats and calculates the midpoint and the distance to check if the condition holds.
   - The logic inside the nested loops seems to be checking if a point can be found where at least `K` pieces of meat meet the time requirement. However, the implementation does not seem to correctly handle the case where the heat source should be placed optimally.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the possible times to find the minimum time `T` where at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled.
   - It correctly narrows down the time range using the results from `func_1`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic is sound in terms of using binary search to find the optimal time and then checking the feasibility with `func_1`.
   - However, `func_1` has some issues in its implementation. Specifically, it assumes a linear relationship and does not correctly handle the quadratic nature of the distance calculation.

Given these points, although the program structure is correct, the implementation of `func_1` might not yield the correct solution due to potential inaccuracies in the midpoint calculations and handling of distances.

Correctness: **False**
