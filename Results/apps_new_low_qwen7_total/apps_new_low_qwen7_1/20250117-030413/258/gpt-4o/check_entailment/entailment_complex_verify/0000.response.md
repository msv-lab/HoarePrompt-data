Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version against the problem statement and the sample input.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Function Purpose**: `func_1` checks if there exists a heat source position such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready to eat within a given time `T`.
2. **Pairwise Comparison**: It iterates over all pairs of meats, calculates the midpoint between them, and checks if any piece of meat can be ready within `T`.
3. **Optimization Limitation**: While `func_1` considers pairs of meats, it doesn't necessarily find the global minimum. It only checks pairwise combinations, which might miss the optimal position that could make more than just a pair of meats ready simultaneously.

### Analysis of `func_2`:

1. **Binary Search Approach**: `func_2` uses a binary search to find the smallest `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
2. **Use of `func_1`**: It repeatedly calls `func_1` to check if a given `T` is valid. If valid, it narrows the upper bound; otherwise, it narrows the lower bound.
3. **Precision**: The binary search ensures that the result is precise up to \(10^{-7}\), which is sufficient for the problem requirements.

### Analysis of `func_3`:

1. **Input Parsing**: `func_3` reads the input, constructs the list of meats, and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
2. **Correctness**: It handles the input parsing and passes the correct parameters to the optimization functions.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:

1. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the annotations, such as when the list of meats is empty or when `K` exceeds the number of pieces of meat.
2. **Optimization Process**: The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the program converges to the optimal solution within the specified precision. The use of `func_1` to check validity of `T` values ensures that the search space is appropriately narrowed.
3. **Sample Input**: For the given sample input, the program should find that the optimal time is approximately 2.4 seconds, which matches the expected output.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The binary search ensures that the solution is accurate to within the required precision, and the pairwise checks in `func_1` are a reasonable heuristic to narrow down the search space.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
