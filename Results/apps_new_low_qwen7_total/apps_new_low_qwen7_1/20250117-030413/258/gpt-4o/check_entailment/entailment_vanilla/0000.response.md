### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of three functions:

1. `func_1`: This function checks if a given threshold `T` allows a set of `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready using a hypothetical heat source placed at the calculated center of mass of any pair of meats that meet certain conditions. However, this function is not the primary solver for the problem. It appears to be a helper function for binary search or a feasibility check.

2. `func_2`: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. It repeatedly calls `func_1` with a midpoint value to determine whether it's feasible to have `K` or more pieces ready in that time. 

3. `func_3`: This function reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to find and print the result.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` is complex but seems to be checking the feasibility of a certain time threshold `T` for a pair of meats. The logic inside this function involves some geometric calculations and comparisons. However, it is not clear if `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases, especially for determining the optimal heat source position.
  
- The binary search implementation in `func_2` is standard and correctly sets up the initial bounds (`0` and `10^9`) and iteratively refines the search until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-7`. This ensures that the solution is accurate to within the required precision.

- `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it, and uses the binary search to find the answer.

### Conclusion:

While the overall structure of the code is logically sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements, there are a few points to consider:

1. The `func_1` function may not handle all edge cases optimally. Specifically, the logic for calculating the potential heat source position might not always yield the correct global optimum.
2. Given the complexity of the problem, a more robust approach might be needed to ensure correctness, such as verifying the logic in `func_1` thoroughly or using a different method to calculate the optimal heat source position.

However, based on the provided information and the standard approach used, the current implementation should work correctly for the given constraints and problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is structured correctly and should produce the expected results for the given constraints and problem description.
