Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the way the heat source is being optimized. The program attempts to find a valid heat source position for each pair of meats and uses binary search to refine the position, but it does not ensure that the found position minimizes the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. 

The `func_1` function checks if a given temperature `T` would make a certain number of pieces of meat ready, but it does not guarantee that the chosen position is the optimal one. It only checks pairs of meats and does not consider the global minimum. Additionally, the `func_2` function performs binary search on `T`, but it relies on `func_1` to determine if a given `T` is valid, which might not always give the correct optimal solution due to the limitations in the approach used.

For example, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```
The correct output should be approximately 2.4 seconds, as explained in the sample output. However, the provided code might not find this optimal solution due to the limitations in the heuristic approach used to determine the heat source position. Therefore, the program does not guarantee the correct solution for every potential case, making it incorrect.
