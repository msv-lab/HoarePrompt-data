The function reads input values for `N` and `K` from standard input, where `N` represents the number of pieces of meat and `K` is an integer constraint. It then constructs a list of tuples `meats`, each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of each piece of meat. The function calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input types or out-of-bound values for `N` and `K`. If the input types are incorrect (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or `K`), the program may fail to execute correctly. The function assumes valid input within the specified constraints (1 <= K <= N <= 60).
