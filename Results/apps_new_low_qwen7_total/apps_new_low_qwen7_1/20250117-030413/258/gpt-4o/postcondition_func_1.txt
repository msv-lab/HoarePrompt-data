The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and hardness \(c_i\) of a piece of meat, with the conditions \(-1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq 100\), and all \((x_i, y_i)\) are unique.

The function uses a binary search approach to find a specific value within a range. Initially, the range is set from 0 to 1000000000.0. The function iterates until the difference between `low` and `high` is less than \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). In each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.

The function then calls another function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` to evaluate whether a certain condition related to the `meats` list and the current midpoint value `mid` is met. If the condition is met, it means that `mid` is potentially too high, so `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `mid` is considered too low, and `low` is updated to `mid`.

After the loop terminates, `high` is returned, which converges to the same value as `low` within a precision of \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). This final value represents a threshold or boundary condition related to the `meats` list and the parameters `N` and `K`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the list `meats` is empty, the function will return `high` as 0 since no valid `mid` can satisfy the condition in `func_1`.
- If `func_1` always returns `False`, `low` will eventually converge to 0, and `high` will also be 0.
- If `func_1` always returns `True`, `high` will converge to the initial upper bound of 1000000000.0.

The function ensures that the returned value is precise up to \(1 \times 10^{-7}\), making it suitable for scenarios where a high degree of accuracy is required.
