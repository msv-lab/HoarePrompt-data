Output State: **N is 2, K is 2, index is 10, meats is [(data[4], data[5], data[6]), (x, y, c)]**

Explanation:
- The initial state is `N` is 2, `K` is 2, `index` is 7, `meats` is [(x, y, c), (data[4], data[5], data[6])].
- The first line `x = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[7]` to `x`.
- The second line `y = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[8]` to `y`.
- The third line `c = int(data[index + 2])` assigns the integer value of `data[9]` to `c`.
- The fourth line `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`.
- The fifth line `index += 3` increments `index` by 3, making `index` equal to 10.

Since the exact values of `data[7]`, `data[8]`, and `data[9]` are not provided, they are represented as `x`, `y`, and `c` respectively in the final state. The updated list `meats` includes both original tuples and the newly appended tuple.
