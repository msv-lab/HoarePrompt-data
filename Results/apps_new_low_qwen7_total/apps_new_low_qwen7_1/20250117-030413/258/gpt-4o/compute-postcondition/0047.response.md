To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop variable `j` is initialized in the for loop as `j = i + 1`.
- The loop iterates from `j = i + 1` to `j < N`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `N`.
   - `j` is `N`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `j in range(i + 1, N)`, which means `j` should be in the range from `i + 1` to `N - 1`.

3. **First Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must satisfy the condition `j >= i + 1` and `j < N`.

4. **Initial Values for `j`:**
   - Since `i` is `N`, the initial value of `j` is `N`.
   - For `j` to enter the loop, `j` must be incremented or set to a value such that `j >= i + 1` and `j < N`.

5. **Loop Initialization:**
   - In Python, the loop starts with `j = i + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be at least `N + 1` to satisfy the condition `j >= i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be incremented to at least `N + 1`.

### State Adjustment:
- The state must ensure that `j` is set to a value that satisfies the loop condition.
- `i` remains `N`.

Thus, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`i` is `N`, `j` must be at least `N + 1`**.
