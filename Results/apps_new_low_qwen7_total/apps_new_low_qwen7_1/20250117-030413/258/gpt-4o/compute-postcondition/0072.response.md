The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or changed by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is at least N + 2, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\)**
