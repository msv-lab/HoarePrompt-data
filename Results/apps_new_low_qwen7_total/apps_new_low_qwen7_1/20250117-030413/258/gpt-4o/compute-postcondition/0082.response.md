The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the variables' values remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables outside of a loop context.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `x1` is now `x2`, `y1` is now `y2`, `c1` is now `c2`, `x2` is now `x1`, `y2` is now `y1`, `c2` is now `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` (a negative value), `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` retain their original values.**
