Output State: **i is N, j is at least N + 1, x1 is the first element of meats[j], y1 is the second element of meats[j], c1 is the third element of meats[j], x2 is the first element of meats[i], y2 is the second element of meats[i], c2 is the third element of meats[i], d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is (dx * dx + dy * dy)**

Explanation:
- The first line divides `d` by the product of `c1` and `c2`. This updates the value of `d`.
- The second line calculates the midpoint `cx` between `x1` and `x2`.
- The third line calculates the midpoint `cy` between `y1` and `y2`.
- The fourth line calculates the difference `dx` between `x1` and `x2`.
- The fifth line calculates the difference `dy` between `y1` and `y2`.
- The sixth line calculates the squared distance `d2` between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the formula \(dx^2 + dy^2\).

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
