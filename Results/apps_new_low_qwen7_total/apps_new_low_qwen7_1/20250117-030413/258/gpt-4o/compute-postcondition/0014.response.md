The code assigns the value of `(low + high) / 2` to the variable `mid`. The variables `low` and `high` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `mid` in terms of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) / 2`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is unchanged**
