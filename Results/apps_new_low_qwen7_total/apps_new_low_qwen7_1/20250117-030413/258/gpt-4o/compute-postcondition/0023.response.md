The code updates the value of `d` to `c1 * T - c2 * T`. According to the initial state, `c1` is `c2_val` and `c2` is `c1_val`. So, `d` becomes `(c2_val - c1_val) * T`. 

The rest of the variables (`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2_val`, `y1` is `y2_val`, `c1` is `c2_val`, `x2` is `x1_val`, `y2` is `y1_val`, `c2` is `c1_val`, `d` is \((c2_val - c1_val) \times T\), `cx` is \(\frac{y1_val + x1_val}{2}\), `cy` is `y1_val`, `dx` is \(\frac{y1_val - x1_val}{2}\), `dy` is `0`, `d2` is `y1_val - x1_val`.**
