Postcondition: ***`i` is N, `j` is at least N + 1, `x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, the elements remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` stay as they are before the if condition check.***
