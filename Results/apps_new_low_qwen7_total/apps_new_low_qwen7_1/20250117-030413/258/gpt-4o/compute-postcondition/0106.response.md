Postcondition: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `d` is d / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is dx * dx + dy * dy, `mx` is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `my` is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `count` is the sum of c * math.sqrt((mx - x) for each element in the `meats` list, and the current value of count is greater than or equal to K**
