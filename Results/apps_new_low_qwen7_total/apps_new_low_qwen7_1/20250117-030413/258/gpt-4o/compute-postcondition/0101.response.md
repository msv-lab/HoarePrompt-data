Output State: **i is N - 1, x1 is the first element of the tuple at index j in the meats list, y1 is the second element of the tuple at index j in the meats list, c1 is the third element of the tuple at index j in the meats list, x2 is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, y2 is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, c2 is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, d is d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy**

Explanation:
1. `d /= c1 * c2`: This line updates `d` to be `d / (c1 * c2)`.
2. `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2`: This line calculates the average of `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `cx`.
3. `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`: This line calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`.
4. `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`: This line calculates half the difference between `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `dx`.
5. `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`: This line calculates half the difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `dy`.
6. `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy`: This line calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` and assigns it to `d2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
