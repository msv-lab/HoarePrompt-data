Postcondition: **i is N, j is at least N + 2, x1 is the first element of meats[i], y1 is the second element of meats[i], c1 is the third element of meats[i], x2 is the first element of meats[j], y2 is the second element of meats[j], c2 is the third element of meats[j], d is ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)), cx is ((x1 + x2) / 2), cy is ((y1 + y2) / 2), dx is ((x1 - x2) / 2), dy is ((y1 - y2) / 2), d2 is ((dx * dx + dy * dy)), mx is (cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2), my is (cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2), count is the number of elements (x, y, c) in meats such that c * sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2) is less than d. If c1 * T < c2 * T, then the count is updated accordingly.**
