Postcondition: ***`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the original `x2`, `y1` is the original `y2`, `c1` is the original `c2`, `x2` is the original `x1`, `y2` is the original `y1`, `c2` is the original `c1`, `d` is `c1 * c2 / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is (`x1` + `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1` - `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1` - `y2`) / 2, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`. If `d * d2 > d2`, then no changes occur. Since there is no else part, the variables retain their initial states specified in the precondition.***
