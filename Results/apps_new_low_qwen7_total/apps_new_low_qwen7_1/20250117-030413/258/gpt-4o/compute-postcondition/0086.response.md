Postcondition: ***i retains its original value, j is now j + 1, x1 is now x2, y1 is now y2, c1 is now c2, x2 is now x1, y2 is now y1, c2 is now c1, d is now d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, and count retains its original value. If d * d2 > d2 holds true, d is updated to d / (c1 * c2).***
