The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats).
- `T` is a non-negative float representing the time threshold.

The function returns True in cases 1 through 10, and returns False in case 10. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `meats`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`, and return True unless a specific condition results in a return value of False.
