Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, `x1` and `x2` are swapped, `y1` and `y2` are swapped, `c1` and `c2` are swapped, `d` remains unchanged, `cx` is the average of `x1` and `x2`, `cy` is the average of `y1` and `y2`, `dx` is half the difference between `x1` and `x2`, `dy` is half the difference between `y1` and `y2`, `d2` is the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`, and `count` is updated based on the condition involving `mx`, `my`, and the distances from meats. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
