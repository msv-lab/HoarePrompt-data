Postcondition: ***count is the updated sum, mx is the calculated value, my is the calculated value, K retains its initial value, cx retains its initial value, cy retains its initial value, dx retains its initial value, dy retains its initial value, d2 retains its initial value, mx retains its updated value, j is i + 2, x1 retains its initial value, y1 retains its initial value, c1 retains its initial value, x2 retains its initial value, y2 retains its initial value, c2 retains its initial value, and d retains its initial value. If count is greater than or equal to K, the function returns True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
