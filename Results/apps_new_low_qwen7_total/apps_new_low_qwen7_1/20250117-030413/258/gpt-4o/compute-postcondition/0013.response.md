Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high - low > 1e-07`.
2. **Current States After Previous Iteration**:
   - `low`, `high`, and `mid` are floating-point numbers.
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True:
     - `low` is either 0 or 250000000.0.
     - `high` is either 250000000.0 or 500000000.0.
     - `mid` is 250000000.0.
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns False:
     - `low` is either 500000000.0 or 750000000.0.
     - `high` is either 750000000.0 or 1000000000.0.
     - `mid` is 750000000.0.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `high - low > 1e-07` must be true.
   - This means that the difference between `high` and `low` must still be greater than `1e-07`.

4. **Analyze Each Case**:
   - **Case 1: `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True**
     - `low` is either 0 or 250000000.0.
     - `high` is either 250000000.0 or 500000000.0.
     - `mid` is 250000000.0.
     - If `low` is 0 and `high` is 250000000.0, then `high - low = 250000000.0 > 1e-07`.
     - If `low` is 250000000.0 and `high` is 500000000.0, then `high - low = 250000000.0 > 1e-07`.
     - In both cases, the loop can continue.

   - **Case 2: `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns False**
     - `low` is either 500000000.0 or 750000000.0.
     - `high` is either 750000000.0 or 1000000000.0.
     - `mid` is 750000000.0.
     - If `low` is 500000000.0 and `high` is 750000000.0, then `high - low = 250000000.0 > 1e-07`.
     - If `low` is 750000000.0 and `high` is 1000000000.0, then `high - low = 250000000.0 > 1e-07`.
     - In both cases, the loop can continue.

Since the loop can continue in all given cases without further adjustment of `low`, `high`, or `mid`, the current states already satisfy the loop condition.

**Final State:**
State: **`low`, `high`, and `mid` are floating-point numbers. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True, `low` is either 0 or 250000000.0, `high` is either 250000000.0 or 500000000.0, and `mid` is 250000000.0. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns False, `low` is either 500000000.0 or 750000000.0, `high` is either 750000000.0 or 1000000000.0, and `mid` is 750000000.0.**
