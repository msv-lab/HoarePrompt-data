The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2_val`, `y1` is `y2_val`, `c1` is `c2_val`, `x2` is `x1_val`, `y2` is `y1_val`, `c2` is `c1_val`, `d` is `((c2_val - c1_val) * T) / (c1_val * c2_val)`, `cx` is `(x1_val + x1_val) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1_val + y1_val) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1_val - x1_val) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1_val - y1_val) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1_val - x1_val)^2 + (y1_val - y1_val)^2**
