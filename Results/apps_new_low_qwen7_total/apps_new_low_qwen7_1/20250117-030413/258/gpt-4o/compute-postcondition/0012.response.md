Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, and `mid` are floating-point numbers. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True, `low` is either 0 or 250000000.0, `high` is either 250000000.0 or 500000000.0, and `mid` is 250000000.0. If `func_1(me_1ts, K, mid)` returns False, `low` is either 500000000.0 or 750000000.0, `high` is either 750000000.0 or 1000000000.0, and `mid` is 750000000.0.***
