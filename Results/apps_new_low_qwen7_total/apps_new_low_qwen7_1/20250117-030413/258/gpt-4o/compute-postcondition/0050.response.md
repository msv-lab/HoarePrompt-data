The code swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Given the initial conditions:

- `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`
- `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`
- `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`
- `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`
- `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`

After executing the code:

- `x1` will be set to the value of `x2`
- `y1` will be set to the value of `y2`
- `c1` will be set to the value of `c2`
- `x2` will be set to the value of `x1` (which was originally `x2`)
- `y2` will be set to the value of `y1` (which was originally `y2`)
- `c2` will be set to the value of `c1` (which was originally `c2`)

Given the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, after the swap, the condition will become `c2 * T < c1 * T`, which is now false.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is at least N + 1, `x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`**
