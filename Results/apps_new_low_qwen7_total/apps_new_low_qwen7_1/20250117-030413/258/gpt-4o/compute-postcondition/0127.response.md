The code `continue` is used inside a loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is mentioned in the given code snippet, and the code itself does not change any variable values, the variables remain in their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`i` is `N - 1`, `x1` is `x2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `x1`, `y1` is `y2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `y1`, `c1` is `c2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `c1`, `x2` is `x2`, `y2` is `y2`, `c2` is `c2`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(original x1 + original x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(original y1 + original y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(original x1 - original x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(original y1 - original y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(original dx * original dx + original dy * original dy)`, `count` is the number of elements in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`.**
