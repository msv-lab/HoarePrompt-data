Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the execution:

Initial State: `N` is 2, `K` is 2, `index` is 9, `meats` is \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300), (data[4], data[5], data[6]), (data[7], data[8], data[9])]\).

Code Snippet:
```python
result = func_2(N, K, meats)
print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

From the code snippet, we can infer the following:
1. The function `func_2` is called with parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`.
2. The result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`.
3. The `print` statement outputs the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places.

However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2`, it is impossible to determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `result`.

Since the code modifies no other variables apart from possibly initializing `result` and using it in the print statement, and since no new variables are created, the only changes are to `result`.

Final State: **N is 2, K is 2, index is 9, result is a floating-point number, meats is \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300), (data[4], data[5], data[6]), (data[7], data[8], data[9])]\)**

Note: The value of `result` is unknown due to the lack of definition for `func_2`.
