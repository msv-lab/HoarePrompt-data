The code swaps the values of `x1, y1, c1` with `x2, y2, c2`. This means that the values of `x1, y1, c1` will now be the original values of `x2, y2, c2`, and the values of `x2, y2, c2` will now be the original values of `x1, y1, c1`.

Output State: **count retains its initial value, K retains its initial value, cx retains its initial value, cy retains its initial value, dx retains its initial value, dy retains its initial value, d2 retains its initial value, mx retains its initial value, j is i + 2, x1 is originally x2, y1 is originally y2, c1 is originally c2, x2 is originally x1, y2 is originally y1, c2 is originally c1**
