Postcondition: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` and `d` remains unchanged if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
