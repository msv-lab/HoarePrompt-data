The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the original `x2`, `y1` is the original `y2`, `c1` is the original `c2`, `x2` is the original `x1`, `y2` is the original `y1`, `c2` is the original `c1`, `d` is `c1 * c2 / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is (`x1` + `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1` - `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1` - `y2`) / 2, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`**
