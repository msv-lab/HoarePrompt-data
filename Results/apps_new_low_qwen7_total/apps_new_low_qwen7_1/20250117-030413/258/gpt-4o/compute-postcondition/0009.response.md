The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `meats`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains three integers `(x, y, c)` representing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of the i-th piece of meat. The function does not have any return cases specified directly in the given information, but it implies that the function will process the list `meats` based on the constraints provided for `N` and `K`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a parameter `meats`, which is a list of tuples containing the coordinates and hardness of pieces of meat.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `meats`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `(x, y, c)` representing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of the i-th piece of meat.**
