The code `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` retain their previous values from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is at least N + 2, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `((x1 + x2) / 2)`, `cy` is `((y1 + y2) / 2)`, `dx` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, `dy` is `((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `d2` is `((dx * dx + dy * dy))`, `mx` is `(cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `my` is `(cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `count` is the number of elements (x, y, c) in `meats` such that `c * sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than `d`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
