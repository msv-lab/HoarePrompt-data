Postcondition: ***`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, `i` remains N - 1 and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain unchanged.***
