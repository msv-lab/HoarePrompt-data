Postcondition: ***`count` retains its initial value, `K` retains its initial value, `cx` is (`x1` + `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1` - `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1` - `y2`) / 2, `d2` is `dx` * `dx` + `dy` * `dy`, `mx` retains its initial value, `j` is `i` + 2, `x1` is either originally `x2` or `x2` (after swapping), `y1` is either originally `y2` or `y1` (after swapping), `c1` is either originally `c2` or `c1` (after swapping), `x2` is either originally `x1` or `x1` (after swapping), `y2` is either originally `y1` or `y1` (after swapping), `c2` is either originally `c1` or `c2` (after swapping), and `d` is (`c1` * `T` - `c2` * `T`) / (`c1` * `c2`). If `d * d2 > d2`, then the condition remains as is; otherwise, the postcondition does not change since there is no else part.***
