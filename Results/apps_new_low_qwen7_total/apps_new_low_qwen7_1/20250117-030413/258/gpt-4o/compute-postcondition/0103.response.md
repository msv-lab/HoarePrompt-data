The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are reassigned or changed within the context of this `continue` statement, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were before.

Output State: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `d` is d / (c1 * c2), `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is dx * dx + dy * dy, the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true.**
