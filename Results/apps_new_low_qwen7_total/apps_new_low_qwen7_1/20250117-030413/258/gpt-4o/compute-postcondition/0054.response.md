The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop and no code to execute after the `continue`, the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement are still valid.

Output State: **`i` is N, `j` is at least N + 1, `x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is c1 * T - c2 * T, and d is less than 0.**
