Output State: **i is N - 1, x1 is the value of x2_val if c1 * T < c2 * T else x1, y1 is the value of y2_val if c1 * T < c2 * T else y1, c1 is the value of c2_val if c1 * T < c2 * T else c1, x2 is x2, y2 is y2, c2 is c2, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is (x1 - x2), mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is the number of elements in meats satisfying the condition (x - mx)^2 + (y - my)^2 <= T^2**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `mx` and `my` using the given formulas involving `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2`.
2. The second line computes `count` by summing up `c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`. This involves calculating the distance from each point in `meats` to the point `(mx, my)` and checking if it is less than or equal to `T`.

Since the code does not modify any of the existing variables and introduces new variables `mx` and `my` and the `count` variable, the initial state of the variables is preserved, except for the introduction of these new variables.
