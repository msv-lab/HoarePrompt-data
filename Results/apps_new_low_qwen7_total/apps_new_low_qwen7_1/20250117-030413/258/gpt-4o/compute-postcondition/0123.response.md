Output State: **i is N - 1, x1 is the original x1, y1 is the original y1, c1 is the original c1, x2 is the original x2, y2 is the original y2, c2 is the original c2, d is 1, cx is (original x1 + original x2) / 2, cy is (original y1 + original y2) / 2, dx is (original x1 - original x2) / 2, dy is (original y1 - original y2) / 2, d2 is (original dx * original dx + original dy * dy), count is the number of elements in meats where the distance from (mx, my) to (x, y) is less than or equal to T, if count is greater than or equal to K, the function returns True, otherwise no change is made to the variables**

Explanation:
- The first two lines unpack the tuple elements from `meats[i]` and `meats[j]` into the variables `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively.
- These operations do not modify the existing variables' values but rather assign new references to the unpacked values.
- Therefore, the values of `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
