Postcondition: ***`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the original `x2`, `y1` is the original `y1`, `c1` is the original `c2`, `x2` is the original `x1`, `y2` is the original `y1`, `c2` is the original `c1`, `d` is 1, `cx` is (original `x1` + original `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (original `y1` + original `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (original `x1` - original `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (original `y1` - original `y2`) / 2, `d2` is (original `dx` * original `dx` + original `dy` * `dy`), `count` is the number of elements in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
