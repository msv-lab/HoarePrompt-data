Output State: **N is 3, K is 2, index is 3, meats is [(x, y, c)] where x, y, and c are integers based on data at index, index + 1, and index + 2 respectively**

Explanation:
- The first line `x = int(data[index])` converts the value at `data[index]` to an integer and assigns it to `x`.
- The second line `y = int(data[index + 1])` converts the value at `data[index + 1]` to an integer and assigns it to `y`.
- The third line `c = int(data[index + 2])` converts the value at `data[index + 2]` to an integer and assigns it to `c`.
- The fourth line `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`.
- The fifth line `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3.

Since the actual values of `data` are not provided, we can only express `x`, `y`, and `c` as integers based on their respective positions in `data`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
