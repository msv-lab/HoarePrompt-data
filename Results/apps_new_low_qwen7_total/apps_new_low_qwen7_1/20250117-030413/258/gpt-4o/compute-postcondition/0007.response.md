Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State
- \( N \) is 3
- \( K \) is 2
- `meats` is \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300)]\)
- `index` is initially not specified but will be used in the loop

### Code Analysis
The loop iterates `N` times. In each iteration:
- `x`, `y`, and `c` are assigned values from `data[index]`, `data[index + 1]`, and `data[index + 2]` respectively.
- These values are appended to the `meats` list.
- `index` is incremented by 3.

### Tracking Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `N` remains 3 throughout the loop because it is set as the range limit.
  - `K` remains 2 throughout the loop as it is not modified.
- **Variable Changes**:
  - `meats`: Initially contains three tuples, and new tuples are added in each iteration.
  - `index`: Increases by 3 with each iteration.

### Summarizing the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute exactly 3 times because \( N = 3 \).
- Each iteration appends one new tuple to `meats`.
- After 3 iterations, `index` will be \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

### Verifying Relationships
- After 1 iteration, `meats` becomes \([(x, y, c)]\).
- After 2 iterations, `meats` becomes \([(x, y, c), (data[4], data[5], data[6])]\).
- After 3 iterations, `meats` becomes \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300), (data[4], data[5], data[6]), (data[7], data[8], data[9])]\).
- `index` becomes 9 after 3 iterations.

### Final Output State
Given the analysis above, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is:

Output State: **N is 2, K is 2, index is 9, meats is \([(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 200), (5, 6, 300), (data[4], data[5], data[6]), (data[7], data[8], data[9])]\).**
