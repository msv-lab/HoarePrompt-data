Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `i` (since `j` starts from `i + 1`).

2. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < N`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `count`, `K`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` retain their initial values.
   - The loop condition depends on `j` and `N`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and the loop continues until `j < N`, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged since it is not being modified within the loop.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - All other variables (`count`, `K`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`) retain their initial values.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `N`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`count`, `K`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx` retain their initial values, `j` is incremented by 1, and the function returns True if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`. Otherwise, the function returns no change to the variables.**

However, specifically stating the values:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If `j` was previously `i + 1`, then `j` becomes `i + 2`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`count`, `K`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx` retain their initial values, `j` is `i + 2`, and the function returns True if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`. Otherwise, the function returns no change to the variables.**
