Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`. It iterates through all pairs of pieces of meat in the `meats` list and calculates the distance and angle between them based on their hardness and time threshold `T`. For each pair, it checks if the number of pieces of meat within a certain distance from the calculated midpoint is greater than or equal to `K`. If such a pair is found, the function returns `True`. If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the list of meats is empty, the function should return `False`.
- When `K` is greater than the number of pieces of meat, the function should return `False` because it's impossible to find `K` or more pieces of meat within the given conditions.

Missing functionality:
- The current implementation assumes that the list `meats` is not empty and that `K` is less than or equal to the length of `meats`. However, the function should handle these edge cases explicitly.**

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be that the function returns either `True` if at least one pair of meat satisfies the condition, or `False` if no such pair is found.
