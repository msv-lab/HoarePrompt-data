Let's break down the given code and determine its effects on the variables step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x1` is `x2_val`
- `y1` is `y2_val`
- `c1` is `c2_val`
- `x2` is `x1_val`
- `y2` is `y1_val`
- `c2` is `c1_val`
- `d` is `((c2_val - c1_val) * T) / (c1_val * c2_val)`
- `cx` is `(x1_val + x1_val) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1_val + y1_val) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1_val - x1_val) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1_val - y1_val) / 2`
- `d2` is `(x1_val - x1_val)^2 + (y1_val - y1_val)^2`

### Code Execution:
1. **Line 1**: `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
   - `cx` is \(\frac{x1\_val + x1\_val}{2} = x1\_val\)
   - `dy` is \(0\)
   - `d2` is \(0\)
   - `d` is \(\frac{(c2\_val - c1\_val) \cdot T}{c1\_val \cdot c2\_val}\)
   - `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` is \(\sqrt{0 - 0} = 0\)
   - `mx` becomes \(x1\_val + 0 \cdot 0 / 0 = x1\_val\). However, division by zero is undefined, so this line causes an error and no further computation can proceed.

Since the first line causes a division by zero error, the subsequent lines cannot be executed. Therefore, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` remain unchanged from their initial states. 

### Final Output State:
Output State: **x1 is x1_val, y1 is y2_val, c1 is c2_val, x2 is x1_val, y2 is y1_val, c2 is c1_val, d is ((c2_val - c1_val) * T) / (c1_val * c2_val), cx is x1_val, cy is y1_val, dx is 0, dy is 0, d2 is 0, mx is x1_val**
