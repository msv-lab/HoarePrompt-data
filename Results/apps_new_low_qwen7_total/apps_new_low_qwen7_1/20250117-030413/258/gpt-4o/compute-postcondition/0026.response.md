Output State: **x1 is x2_val, y1 is y2_val, c1 is c2_val, x2 is x1_val, y2 is y1_val, c2 is c1_val, d is ((c2_val - c1_val) * T) / (c1_val * c2_val), cx is (x1_val + x1_val) / 2, cy is (y1_val + y1_val) / 2, dx is (x1_val - x1_val) / 2, dy is (y1_val - y1_val) / 2, d2 is (x1_val - x1_val)^2 + (y1_val - y1_val)^2**

Explanation:
1. The first line divides `d` by `c1 * c2`. Given `c1` is `c2_val` and `c2` is `c1_val`, this becomes `d = ((c2_val - c1_val) * T) / (c1_val * c2_val)`.
2. The second line updates `cx` to be the average of `x1` and `x2`. Since `x1` is `x2_val` and `x2` is `x1_val`, `cx` becomes `(x1_val + x1_val) / 2`.
3. The third line updates `cy` to be the average of `y1` and `y2`. Since `y1` is `y2_val` and `y2` is `y1_val`, `cy` becomes `(y1_val + y1_val) / 2`.
4. The fourth line updates `dx` to be half the difference between `x1` and `x2`. Since `x1` is `x2_val` and `x2` is `x1_val`, `dx` becomes `(x1_val - x1_val) / 2`, which is `0`.
5. The fifth line updates `dy` to be half the difference between `y1` and `y2`. Since `y1` is `y2_val` and `y2` is `y1_val`, `dy` becomes `(y1_val - y1_val) / 2`, which is `0`.
6. The sixth line calculates `d2` as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Since both `dx` and `dy` are `0`, `d2` becomes `0^2 + 0^2`, which is `0`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
