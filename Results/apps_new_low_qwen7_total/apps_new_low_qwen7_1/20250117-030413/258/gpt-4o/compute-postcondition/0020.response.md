The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 60\). `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and hardness \(c_i\) of a piece of meat, and the conditions \(-1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq 100\) hold true, with all \((x_i, y_i)\) being unique.

The function returns a value `high`, which converges to the same value as `low` within a precision of \(1 \times 10^{-7}\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, and return a value `high` that is equal to `low` within a precision of \(1 \times 10^{-7}\).
