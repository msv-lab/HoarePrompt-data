Postcondition: ***i retains its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `x1` is now `x2`, `y1` is now `y2`, `c1` is now `c2`, `x2` is now `x1`, `y2` is now `y1`, `c2` is now `c1`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` retain their original values, provided that `c1 * T < c2 * T`. Otherwise, the same variables retain their values as per the precondition.***
