The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `N - 1`, `x1` is the original `x2`, `y1` is the original `y2`, `c1` is the original `c2`, `x2` is the original `x1`, `y2` is the original `y1`, `c2` is the original `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` for all tuples in the `meats` list, and `count` is less than `K`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, otherwise no changes are made.**
