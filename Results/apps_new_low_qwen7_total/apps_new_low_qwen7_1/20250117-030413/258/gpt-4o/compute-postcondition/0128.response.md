Postcondition: ***`i` is `N - 1`, `x1` is `x2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `x1`, `y1` is `y2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `y1`, `c1` is `c2_val` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `c1`, `x2` is `x2`, `y2` is `y2`, `c2` is `c2`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(original x1 + original x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(original y1 + original y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(original x1 - original x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(original y1 - original y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(original dx * original dx + original dy * original dy)`, `count` is the number of elements in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`. If `d < 0`, `d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`.***
