The variable `mid` is initially defined as `(low + high) / 2`. The variables `low` and `high` remain unchanged. The code `low = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `low`. After this assignment, the value of `low` becomes `(low + high) / 2`.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) / 2`, `low` is `(low + high) / 2`, `high` is unchanged**
