The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the code does not change any variables or move into another part of the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index j in the `meats` list, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the `meats` list, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.**
