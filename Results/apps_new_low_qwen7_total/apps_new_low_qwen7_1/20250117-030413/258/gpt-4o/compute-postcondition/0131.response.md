Postcondition: ***`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the value of `x2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `x1`, `y1` is the value of `y2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `y1`, `c1` is the value of `c2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `c1`, `x2` is `x2`, `y2` is `y2`, `c2` is `c2`, `d` is (`c1` * `T` - `c2` * `T`) / (`c1` * `c2`), `cx` is (`x1` + `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1` - `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1` - `y2`) / 2, `d2` is (`x1` - `x2`), if `d` * `d2` > `d2`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
