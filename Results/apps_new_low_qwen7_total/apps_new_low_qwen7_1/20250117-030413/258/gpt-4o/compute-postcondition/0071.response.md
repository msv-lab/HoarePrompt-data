Output State: **i is N, j is at least N + 2, x1 is the first element of meats[i], y1 is the second element of meats[i], c1 is the third element of meats[i], x2 is the first element of meats[j], y2 is the second element of meats[j], c2 is the third element of meats[j], d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)**

Explanation:
1. `d /= c1 * c2`: The value of `d` is updated to be `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
2. `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2`: The value of `cx` is updated to be the average of `x1` and `x2`.
3. `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`: The value of `cy` is updated to be the average of `y1` and `y2`.
4. `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`: The value of `dx` is updated to be half the difference between `x1` and `x2`.
5. `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`: The value of `dy` is updated to be half the difference between `y1` and `y2`.
6. `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy`: The value of `d2` is updated to be the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
