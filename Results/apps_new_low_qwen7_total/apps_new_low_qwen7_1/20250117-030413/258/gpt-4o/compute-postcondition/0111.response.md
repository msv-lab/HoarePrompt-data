The code swaps the values of `x1, y1, c1` with `x2, y2, c2`. Therefore, `x1, y1, c1` will now hold the values that `x2, y2, c2` held previously. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **i is N - 1, x1 is the original x2, y1 is the original y2, c1 is the original c2, x2 is the original x1, y2 is the original y1, c2 is the original c1, d is d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is the sum of c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2) for all tuples in the meats list, and count is less than K**
