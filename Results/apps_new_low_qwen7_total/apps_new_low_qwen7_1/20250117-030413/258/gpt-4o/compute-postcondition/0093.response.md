Initial State: `i` is \(N - 1\).

Code Block:
```
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
```

Analysis:
- The first line unpacks the tuple at index `i` of the `meats` list into variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.
- The second line unpacks the tuple at index `j` of the `meats` list into variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`.

Since the initial state only mentions the value of `i` being \(N - 1\) and no other variables are specified, we can conclude the following:
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index \(N - 1\) in the `meats` list.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index \(N - 1\) in the `meats` list.
- `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index \(N - 1\) in the `meats` list.
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list.
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list.
- `c2` is the third element of the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list.

No other variables are affected by this code block.

Output State: **i is N - 1, x1 is the first element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, y1 is the second element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, c1 is the third element of the tuple at index N - 1 in the meats list, x2 is the first element of the tuple at index j in the meats list, y2 is the second element of the tuple at index j in the meats list, c2 is the third element of the tuple at index j in the meats list**
