The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or states. All variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **count retains its initial value, K retains its initial value, cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, mx retains its initial value, j is i + 2, x1 is either originally x2 or x2 (after swapping), y1 is either originally y2 or y1 (after swapping), c1 is either originally c2 or c1 (after swapping), x2 is either originally x1 or x1 (after swapping), y2 is either originally y1 or y1 (after swapping), c2 is either originally c1 or c2 (after swapping), and d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)**
