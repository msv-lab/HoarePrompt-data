Postcondition: ***count retains its initial value, K retains its initial value, cx retains its initial value, cy retains its initial value, dx retains its initial value, dy retains its initial value, d2 retains its initial value, mx retains its initial value, j is i + 2, x1 is either originally x2 or x2 (after swapping), y1 is either originally y2 or y2 (after swapping), c1 is either originally c2 or c2 (after swapping), x2 is either originally x1 or x1 (after swapping), y2 is either originally y1 or y1 (after swapping), c2 is either originally c1 or c1 (after swapping). If c1 * T < c2 * T, then x1 is originally x2, y1 is originally y2, c1 is originally c2, x2 is originally x1, y2 is originally y1, c2 is originally c1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
