The variable `mid` is initially defined as `(low + high) / 2`. The variables `low` and `high` remain unchanged. The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`, which itself is `(low + high) / 2`.

Therefore, after the code execution, `low` remains unchanged, `high` is updated to be `(low + high) / 2`, and `mid` is still defined as `(low + high) / 2`.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) / 2`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`**
