The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is N - 1, `x1` is the value of `x2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `x1`, `y1` is the value of `y2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `y1`, `c1` is the value of `c2_val` if `c1` * `T` < `c2` * `T` else `c1`, `x2` is `x2`, `y2` is `y2`, `c2` is `c2`, `d` is (`c1` * `T` - `c2` * `T`) / (`c1` * `c2`), `cx` is (`x1` + `x2`) / 2, `cy` is (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `dx` is (`x1` - `x2`) / 2, `dy` is (`y1` - `y2`) / 2, `d2` is (`x1` - `x2`)**
