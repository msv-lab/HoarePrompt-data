Output State: **`low`, `high`, and `mid` are floating-point numbers. `low` and `high` converge to the same value within a precision of 1e-07. `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`. The exact values of `low` and `high` depend on the evaluations of `func_1(meats, K, mid)` over the iterations.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `high - low > 1e-07`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high` in each iteration.
   - Depending on the evaluation of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`, either `high` or `low` is updated.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `mid` is updated in every iteration but remains constant once the loop condition no longer holds.
   - `low` and `high` are updated based on the result of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
   - `meats`, `N`, and `K` remain constant throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop narrows down the range between `low` and `high` until their difference is less than `1e-07`.
   - When the loop exits, both `low` and `high` will be very close to each other, differing by less than `1e-07`.
   - `mid` will also be very close to this value since it is the average of `low` and `high`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions for updating `low` and `high` ensure that `low <= mid < high` always holds.
   - Once the loop terminates, the relationship `high - low <= 1e-07` ensures that `low` and `high` are essentially equal within the required precision.

Thus, after the loop completes, `low` and `high` will be very close to each other, and `mid` will also be very close to these values.
