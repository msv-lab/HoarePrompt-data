The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or the overall state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2_val`, `y1` is `y2_val`, `c1` is `c2_val`, `x2` is `x1_val`, `y2` is `y1_val`, `c2` is `c1_val`, `d` is \((c2_val - c1_val) \times T\), `cx` is \(\frac{y1_val + x1_val}{2}\), `cy` is `y1_val`, `dx` is \(\frac{y1_val - x1_val}{2}\), `dy` is `0`, `d2` is `y1_val - x1_val`.**
