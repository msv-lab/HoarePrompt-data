Initial State: N is 3, K is 2, index is 4, meats is [(x, y, c)] where x, y, and c are integers based on data at index, index + 1, and index + 2 respectively

Code:
```
x = int(data[index])
y = int(data[index + 1])
c = int(data[index + 2])
meats.append((x, y, c))
index += 3
```

Analysis:
1. `x = int(data[index])`: The value of `x` is set to the integer value of `data[4]`.
2. `y = int(data[index + 1])`: The value of `y` is set to the integer value of `data[5]`.
3. `c = int(data[index + 2])`: The value of `c` is set to the integer value of `data[6]`.
4. `meats.append((x, y, c))`: A new tuple `(x, y, c)` is appended to the list `meats`.
5. `index += 3`: The value of `index` is incremented by 3.

Given that the initial state of `index` is 4, after executing `index += 3`, the new value of `index` will be 7. The exact values of `x`, `y`, and `c` depend on the values at `data[4]`, `data[5]`, and `data[6]`, respectively, which are not specified. However, we know that these values will be added to the `meats` list as a new tuple.

Output State: **N is 3, K is 2, index is 7, meats is [(x, y, c), (data[4], data[5], data[6])]**
