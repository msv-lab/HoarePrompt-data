The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` and `k`, where `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones is equal to `m`. If such an `n` is found, the function returns `n`; otherwise, it does not return anything. There are three specific cases defined by the return postconditions:
