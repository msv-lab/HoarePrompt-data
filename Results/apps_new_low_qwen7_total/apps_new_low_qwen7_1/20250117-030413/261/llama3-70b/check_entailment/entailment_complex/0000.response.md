Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find a positive integer \( n \) such that among the numbers \( n+1, n+2, \ldots, 2n \), there are exactly \( m \) numbers whose binary representation contains exactly \( k \) digits one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given number \( n \).
   - It uses bitwise operations to iterate through each bit of \( n \) and count the number of 1s.
   - The function works correctly for any non-negative integer \( n \).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` iteratively searches for the smallest \( n \) such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) with exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation is equal to \( m \).
   - It starts with \( n = 1 \) and increments \( n \) until it finds the correct \( n \).
   - For each \( n \), it calculates the count of numbers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) that have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using `func_1`.
   - If the count matches \( m \), it returns \( n \); otherwise, it continues to the next \( n \).

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to find the required \( n \).
   - The loop ensures that the correct \( n \) is found because it iterates over all possible values of \( n \) starting from 1.
   - Given the constraints \( 0 \leq m \leq 10^{18} \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 64 \), the function will eventually find an \( n \) that satisfies the condition.
   - The function handles the case where no such \( n \) exists within the constraints by continuing to search until it finds a valid \( n \).

Given the analysis, the provided solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
