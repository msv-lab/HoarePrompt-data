Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a given number `n`.
   - It iterates through the bits of `n` using bitwise operations and accumulates the count of '1's.
   - After processing all bits, it returns the count, which is accurate.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find the smallest `n` such that there are exactly `m` integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones.
   - It uses a while loop to increment `n` until the count of such integers matches `m`.
   - For each `n`, it calculates the count of integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` with exactly `k` ones by using `func_1` and summing up the results for each integer in the range.
   - The loop continues to increment `n` until it finds a value where the count matches `m`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Given the constraints \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), the algorithm is designed to find such an `n` that satisfies the problem's requirements.
   - The loop ensures that `n` is incremented until the condition is met, and the function returns the correct `n` when the condition is satisfied.
   - Since the problem guarantees that there is an answer within the given constraints, the function will eventually find and return the correct `n`.

Based on the analysis, the program logic and the functions implemented are correct according to the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
