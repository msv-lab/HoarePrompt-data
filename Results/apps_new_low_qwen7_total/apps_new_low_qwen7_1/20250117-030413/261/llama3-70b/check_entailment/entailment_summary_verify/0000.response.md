### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.
   - It is correctly implemented as it iterates through each bit of the number, counting '1's.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that there are exactly `m` numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones.
   - It uses a while loop to increment `n` until it finds the desired `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the count of numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` that meet the criteria using `func_1`.

Now, let's consider the logic and behavior of the program:

- **Initialization and Loop**: 
  - `func_2` starts with `n = 1` and increments `n` until it finds the correct value.
  - For each `n`, it calculates the count of numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` whose binary representation has exactly `k` ones.
  - If the count matches `m`, it returns `n`.

- **Binary Representation Check**:
  - `func_1` correctly counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.
  - This is used to check the condition for each number in the range `[n+1, 2*n]`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function uses a straightforward approach by incrementing `n` and checking the count for each range.
  - Given the constraints (`m <= 10^18` and `k <= 64`), this approach is feasible and will eventually find the correct `n` because the range is bounded and the number of possible `n` values is manageable.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the required `n`. It uses a simple and effective method to iterate through possible values of `n` and check the count of numbers in the specified range. 

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate.
