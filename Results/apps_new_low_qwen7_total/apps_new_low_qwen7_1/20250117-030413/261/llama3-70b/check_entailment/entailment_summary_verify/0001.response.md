### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task requires finding a positive integer \( n \) such that among the numbers from \( n+1 \) to \( 2 \cdot n \), exactly \( m \) numbers have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(n)` counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \).
   - This function works correctly by iterating through each bit of \( n \) using bitwise operations.
   - The function correctly counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \).

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(m, k)` aims to find the smallest \( n \) such that the condition is met.
   - It uses a brute-force approach by incrementing \( n \) until the correct \( n \) is found.
   - For each \( n \), it calculates the number of integers between \( n+1 \) and \( 2 \cdot n \) that have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using `func_1(i)`.
   - If the count matches \( m \), it returns \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The input constraints ensure that \( n \leq 10^{18} \), and the function is designed to handle this range.
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one solution within the specified range, which simplifies the brute-force search.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The use of `func_1` inside `func_2` is appropriate and works as expected.
   - The brute-force approach will eventually find a solution given the problem constraints.
   - However, the provided implementation does not handle large numbers efficiently. Specifically, the loop `while True:` might take an excessively long time for large values of \( m \) and \( k \), even though the problem statement guarantees a solution exists within the given range.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - While the program theoretically works, the brute-force approach can be inefficient for very large inputs, which could lead to performance issues.
   - The original assessment did not mention potential performance concerns, but these are important in practical applications.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of logic and guarantees a solution within the specified range. However, the brute-force approach might be inefficient for very large inputs, which is a potential issue in practical applications.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

This conclusion is based on the efficiency of the brute-force approach rather than the correctness of the logic itself.
