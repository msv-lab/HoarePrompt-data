Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the required number `n` such that among the numbers `n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2Â·n` there are exactly `m` numbers whose binary representation contains exactly `k` digits one.

The issue lies in the following points:
1. **Binary Representation Check**: The `func_1` function checks the binary representation of a single number, but the program needs to check this condition for a range of numbers from `n + 1` to `2 * n`.
2. **Counting Logic**: The `func_2` function increments `n` until it finds a value where the count of numbers meeting the criteria equals `m`. However, this approach may not efficiently find the correct `n`, especially considering the constraints and potential large values of `m`.

To illustrate, consider the input `m = 3` and `k = 2`. The correct `n` should be `5` because the numbers `6, 7, 8, 9, 10` in binary are `110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010`, and exactly three of these (`6, 7, 10`) have exactly two ones in their binary representation.

However, the provided program may not efficiently or correctly handle all cases. For instance, if `m` is very large, the loop in `func_2` might run for a long time without finding the correct `n`, or it might miss the correct `n` entirely due to the nature of the incrementing process.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee correctness for every potential case, hence the verdict is **False**.
