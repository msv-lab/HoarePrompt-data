Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down and analyze the provided functions and their behaviors.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given non-negative integer `n`.
   - It works by iterating through each bit of `n` and incrementing a counter when a 1 is encountered.
   - This function is used to count the number of 1s in each number from `n + 1` to `2 * n`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the count of numbers between `n + 1` and `2 * n` (inclusive) that have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation is equal to `m`.
   - It starts with `n = 1` and increments `n` in each iteration of the `while` loop.
   - For each value of `n`, it calculates the count of numbers within the range `[n + 1, 2 * n]` that have exactly `k` ones using `func_1`.
   - If this count matches `m`, it returns `n`.
   - If the count is greater than `m`, it continues to the next value of `n`.

Given the constraints:
- \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)
- \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)

The logic in `func_2` ensures that it will eventually find a suitable `n` because:
- The range `[n + 1, 2 * n]` contains at least \(n\) numbers, and as `n` increases, the number of possible integers in the range also increases.
- Since there is always a solution as per the problem statement, the loop will terminate once the correct `n` is found.

The provided examples also validate the functionality:
- For input `(1, 1)`, the output is `1`, which is correct because the range `[1+1, 2*1]` (i.e., `[2, 2]`) has exactly 1 number (2) with 1 one in its binary representation.
- For input `(3, 2)`, the output is `5`, which is correct because the range `[5+1, 2*5]` (i.e., `[6, 10]`) contains exactly 3 numbers (6, 7, 10) with 2 ones in their binary representations.

Based on the analysis and the provided examples, the program is correctly implemented and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
