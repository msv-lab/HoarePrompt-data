### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task requires finding a positive integer \( n \) such that among the numbers from \( n+1 \) to \( 2 \cdot n \), exactly \( m \) numbers have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(n)` counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \).
   - This function works correctly by iterating through each bit of \( n \) using bitwise operations. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, and for each bit position, it checks if the bit is set (i.e., if `n & 1` is 1) and increments the count accordingly. Then it right-shifts `n` to check the next bit. This is a correct implementation.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(m, k)` aims to find the smallest \( n \) such that the condition is met.
   - It uses a brute-force approach by incrementing \( n \) until the correct \( n \) is found.
   - For each \( n \), it calculates the number of integers between \( n+1 \) and \( 2 \cdot n \) that have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using `func_1(i)`.
   - If the count matches \( m \), it returns \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The input constraints ensure that \( n \leq 10^{18} \), and the function is designed to handle this range.
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one solution within the specified range, which simplifies the brute-force search.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The use of `func_1` inside `func_2` is appropriate and works as expected.
   - The brute-force approach will eventually find a solution given the problem constraints.

However, there is a potential issue with the brute-force approach in `func_2`. The loop may run indefinitely without returning if the exact solution is not found in a reasonable time, especially for larger values of \( m \) and \( k \). While the problem guarantees a solution exists, the implementation does not handle cases where the solution might be very large and the loop might take too long to terminate.

Given this, the program is correct in theory but may suffer from performance issues in practice for very large values of \( m \) and \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program theoretically solves the problem correctly, but the brute-force approach may not terminate in a reasonable time for all possible inputs.

### Final:
**False**

This conclusion is based on the theoretical correctness of the algorithm, but practical limitations should be noted.
