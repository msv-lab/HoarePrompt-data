You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, and the function `func_1` is defined to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)
        
        if count == m:
            return n
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{number of integers in the range } [n, 2n-1] \text{ with } \text{func}_1(i) = k}\), and `count` is the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) such that \(\text{func}_1(i) = k\). If `count` equals `m`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains as per the precondition).
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs indefinitely until the condition `count == m` is met.
    #   - `n` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
    #   - `count` is calculated as the number of integers in the range `[n, 2n-1]` whose binary representation has exactly `k` ones.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` increases by 1 in each iteration.
    #   - `count` is recalculated based on the current value of `n`.
    #   - `m` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues to increment `n` until it finds a value where the number of integers in the range `[n, 2n-1]` with exactly `k` ones matches `m`.
    #   - When this condition is met, the function returns `n`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationship between `m`, `k`, and the range `[n, 2n-1]` ensures that `count` will eventually match `m` for some `n`, given the constraints \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 64\).
    #
    #Thus, the loop will continue to increase `n` until it finds a suitable range where the number of integers with exactly `k` ones in their binary representation matches `m`, at which point it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within the constraints, the function will not return anything (or the postcondition will remain as per the precondition).
    #
    #Output State: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{number of integers in the range } [n, 2n-1] \text{ with } \text{func}_1(i) = k}\), and `count` is the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) such that \(\text{func}_1(i) = k\). If `count` equals `m`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains as per the precondition).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `m` and `k`, where `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), and returns 1, 2, or 3 based on the specified cases.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `The program returns 1`

Case_2: `The program returns 2

Case_3: The program returns 3


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
