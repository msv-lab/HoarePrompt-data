The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `n`. The initial values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function `func_1` is also not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, `n` is 1, and the function `func_1` is defined to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.**
