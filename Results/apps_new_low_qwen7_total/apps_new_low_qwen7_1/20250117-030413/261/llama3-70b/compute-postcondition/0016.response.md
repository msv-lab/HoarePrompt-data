The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 3, so after executing `n += 1`, `n` becomes 4. The other variables (`m`, `k`, `count`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 4, `count` is the number of times `func_1(i)` equals `k` for `i` in the range 4 to 6. If `count` equals `m`, the function returns 3. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains as per the precondition).**
