Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial states of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, `n` is 1, and the function `func_1` is defined to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.**
