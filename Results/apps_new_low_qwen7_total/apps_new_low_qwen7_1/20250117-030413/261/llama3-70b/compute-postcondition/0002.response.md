Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The variable `count` is initialized to the result of the expression `sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)`.

2. Given the initial state:
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64.
   - `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18.

3. The range for the loop is `range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1)`. Substituting `n` with 1, this becomes `range(2, 3)`.

4. The condition `if func_1(i) == k` checks if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `i` (which are 2 and 3) is equal to `k`.

5. For `i = 2` (binary is `10`), there is 1 '1'. For `i = 3` (binary is `11`), there are 2 '1's.

6. Depending on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is 1, only `i = 2` satisfies the condition, so `count` will be 1.
   - If `k` is 2, only `i = 3` satisfies the condition, so `count` will be 1.
   - If `k` is any other value between 1 and 64 (excluding 1 and 2), no `i` in the range will satisfy the condition, so `count` will be 0.

Since `n` and `m` are not affected by this code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, `n` is 1, `count` is 1 if `k` is 1 or 2, otherwise `count` is 0**
