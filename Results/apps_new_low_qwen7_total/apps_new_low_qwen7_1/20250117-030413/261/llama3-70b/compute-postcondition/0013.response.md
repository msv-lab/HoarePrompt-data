`count` is assigned the value of the sum of 1 for each `i` in the range from `n + 1` to `2 * n` (inclusive) where `func_1(i)` equals `k`. Given that `n` is 3, the range becomes `range(4, 7)`, which means `i` takes the values 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the code checks `func_1(4)`, `func_1(5)`, and `func_1(6)` and increments `count` for each time `func_1(i)` equals `k`.

Since the value of `k` is given as an integer between 1 and 64, and there are no specific details about `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `count` without knowing the results of `func_1(4)`, `func_1(5)`, and `func_1(6)`. However, the possible values of `count` are 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The output state remains: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 3, and `count` is the number of times `func_1(i)` equals `k` for `i` in the range 4 to 6.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 3, and `count` is the number of times `func_1(i)` equals `k` for `i` in the range 4 to 6.**
