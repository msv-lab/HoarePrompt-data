Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` and `k`, where `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones is equal to `m`. If such an `n` is found, the function returns `n`; otherwise, it does not return anything. There are three specific cases defined by the return postconditions:**

1. **If the function finds an `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) with exactly `k` ones is exactly 1, the function returns 1.**
2. **If the function finds an `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) with exactly `k` ones is exactly 2, the function returns 2.**
3. **If the function finds an `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) with exactly `k` ones is exactly 3, the function returns 3.**

**If the function does not find an `n` that satisfies any of these conditions within the given constraints, it does not return anything.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `func_1` correctly counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number. If `func_1` fails to do so, the function's behavior will be incorrect.
- The function uses an infinite loop until it finds the correct `n`, which could lead to a potential infinite loop if the conditions are never met. However, given the constraints \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), the loop is guaranteed to terminate.
- The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are outside their specified ranges; it implicitly relies on the caller to ensure these constraints are met.
