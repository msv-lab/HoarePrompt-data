`n` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `n` is 2. The values of `m`, `k`, `count`, and the condition that `count` is not equal to `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, `n` is 2, `count` is 1 if `k` is 1 or 2, otherwise `count` is 0, and `count` is not equal to `m`**
