#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18. The function `func_1` counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        
        n >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: count is the total number of 1s in the binary representation of n, and n is 0.
    return count
    #The program returns 0 since n is 0 and the total number of 1s in the binary representation of 0 is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the total number of 1s in its binary representation. Specifically, it iterates through each bit of `n`, counting the number of 1s until `n` becomes 0. If `n` is 0 initially, the function directly returns 0. This covers the edge case where `n` is 0, as the binary representation of 0 contains no 1s.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, and the function `func_1` is defined to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of a number.
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)
        
        if count == m:
            return n
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{number of integers in the range } [n, 2n-1] \text{ with } \text{func}_1(i) = k}\), and `count` is the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) such that \(\text{func}_1(i) = k\). If `count` equals `m`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains as per the precondition).

    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs indefinitely until the condition `count == m` is met.
    #   - `n` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
    #   - `count` is calculated as the number of integers in the range `[n, 2n-1]` whose binary representation has exactly `k` ones.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` increases by 1 in each iteration.
    #   - `count` is recalculated based on the current value of `n`.
    #   - `m` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues to increment `n` until it finds a value where the number of integers in the range `[n, 2n-1]` with exactly `k` ones matches `m`.
    #   - When this condition is met, the function returns `n`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationship between `m`, `k`, and the range `[n, 2n-1]` ensures that `count` will eventually match `m` for some `n`, given the constraints \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 64\).
    #
    #Thus, the loop will continue to increase `n` until it finds a suitable range where the number of integers with exactly `k` ones in their binary representation matches `m`, at which point it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within the constraints, the function will not return anything (or the postcondition will remain as per the precondition).
    #
    #Output State: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{number of integers in the range } [n, 2n-1] \text{ with } \text{func}_1(i) = k}\), and `count` is the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) such that \(\text{func}_1(i) = k\). If `count` equals `m`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains as per the precondition).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `m` and `k`, where `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers in the range \([n, 2n-1]\) whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones is equal to `m`. If such an `n` is found, the function returns `n`; otherwise, it does not return anything. There are three specific cases defined by the return postconditions:
