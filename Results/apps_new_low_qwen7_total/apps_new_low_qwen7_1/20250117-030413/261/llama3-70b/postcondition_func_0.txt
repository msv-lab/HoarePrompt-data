The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the total number of 1s in its binary representation. Specifically, it iterates through each bit of `n`, counting the number of 1s until `n` becomes 0. If `n` is 0 initially, the function directly returns 0. This covers the edge case where `n` is 0, as the binary representation of 0 contains no 1s.
