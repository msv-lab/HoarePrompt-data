Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and extracts the values of `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k`.
2. It calculates the overlapping time period by determining the maximum start time (`start = max(l1, l2)`) and the minimum end time (`end = min(r1, r2)`).
3. If the prinking time `k` falls within the overlapping interval, the end time is decremented by 1 (`if start <= k <= end: end -= 1`).
4. Finally, it calculates the number of overlapping minutes using `max(0, end - start + 1)` and prints the result.
5. The logic for handling the prinking time `k` is correct; it ensures that the overlap duration is adjusted properly if `k` falls within the overlapping interval.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly calculate the number of minutes Sonya and Filya can spend together.

Correctness: **True**
