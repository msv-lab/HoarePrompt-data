### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads five integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This handles the valid range of inputs as specified (1 to \(10^{18}\)).

2. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - **Start Time Calculation**: `start = max(l1, l2)` ensures that the earliest possible starting time is chosen.
   - **End Time Calculation**: `end = min(r1, r2)` ensures that the latest possible ending time is chosen.
   
3. **Prinking Check**:
   - If Sonya's prinking time (`k`) falls within the overlapping segment, the end time is decremented by 1 (`end -= 1`). This adjustment is necessary because if `k` is within the overlap, it reduces the number of available minutes by one.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - `minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)` calculates the number of overlapping minutes. The `max(0, ...)` ensures that if there is no overlap, the result is zero.
   - The use of `+1` in the calculation accounts for both inclusive endpoints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the intervals do not overlap at all.
   - It also correctly handles the prinking time `k` being included in the overlap.

Given this analysis, the provided solution appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

### Correctness:
