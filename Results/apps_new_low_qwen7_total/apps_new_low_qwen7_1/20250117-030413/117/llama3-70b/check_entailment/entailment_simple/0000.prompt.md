Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, and l_2 ≤ r_2.
def func():
    l1, r1, l2, r2, k = map(int, input().split())

start = max(l1, l2)

end = min(r1, r2)
    if (start <= k <= end) :
        end -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is `min(r1, r2) - 1`, `k` is input value 5, `l1` is input value 1, `r1` is input value 2, `l2` is input value 3, `r2` is input value 4.
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)

print(minutes_together)
