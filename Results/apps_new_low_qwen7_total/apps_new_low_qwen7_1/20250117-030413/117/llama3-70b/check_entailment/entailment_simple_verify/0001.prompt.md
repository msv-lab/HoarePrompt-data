You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Today an outstanding event is going to happen in the forest — hedgehog Filya will come to his old fried Sonya!

Sonya is an owl and she sleeps during the day and stay awake from minute l_1 to minute r_1 inclusive. Also, during the minute k she prinks and is unavailable for Filya.

Filya works a lot and he plans to visit Sonya from minute l_2 to minute r_2 inclusive.

Calculate the number of minutes they will be able to spend together.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 and k (1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ r_2), providing the segments of time for Sonya and Filya and the moment of time when Sonya prinks.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the number of minutes Sonya and Filya will be able to spend together.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 10 9 20 1

Output
2

Input
1 100 50 200 75

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first sample, they will be together during minutes 9 and 10.

In the second sample, they will be together from minute 50 to minute 74 and from minute 76 to minute 100.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) = map(int, input().split())
    start = max(l1, l2)
    end = min(r1, r2)
    if start <= k <= end:
        end -= 1
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)
    print(minutes_together)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, and l_2 ≤ r_2.
def func():
    l1, r1, l2, r2, k = map(int, input().split())

start = max(l1, l2)

end = min(r1, r2)
    if (start <= k <= end) :
        end -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is `min(r1, r2) - 1`, `k` is input value 5, `l1` is input value 1, `r1` is input value 2, `l2` is input value 3, `r2` is input value 4.
    minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)

print(minutes_together)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads five integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This handles the valid range of inputs as specified (1 to \(10^{18}\)).

2. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - **Start Time Calculation**: `start = max(l1, l2)` ensures that the earliest possible starting time is chosen.
   - **End Time Calculation**: `end = min(r1, r2)` ensures that the latest possible ending time is chosen.
   
3. **Prinking Check**:
   - If Sonya's prinking time (`k`) falls within the overlapping segment, the end time is decremented by 1 (`end -= 1`). This adjustment is necessary because if `k` is within the overlap, it reduces the number of available minutes by one.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - `minutes_together = max(0, end - start + 1)` calculates the number of overlapping minutes. The `max(0, ...)` ensures that if there is no overlap, the result is zero.
   - The use of `+1` in the calculation accounts for both inclusive endpoints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the intervals do not overlap at all.
   - It also correctly handles the prinking time `k` being included in the overlap.

Given this analysis, the provided solution appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and handles all given conditions properly.
