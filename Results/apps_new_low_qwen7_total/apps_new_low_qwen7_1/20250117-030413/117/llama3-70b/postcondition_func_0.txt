The function `func` accepts five integers `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, `r_2`, and `k` as input. It calculates the maximum overlap between two time intervals `[l_1, r_1]` and `[l_2, r_2]` and returns the length of this overlap, which is the number of minutes both intervals are together. If `k` falls within this overlap, the function adjusts the end of the overlap by decrementing it by 1. If the calculated overlap length is negative or zero, the function returns 0.
