Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is `min(r1, r2) - 1`, `k` is input value 5, `l1` is input value 1, `r1` is input value 2, `l2` is input value 3, `r2` is input value 4.**

Explanation: Since the else part does not exist, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition `start <= k <= end` holds true, and as per the if part, `end` is updated to `min(r1, r2) - 1`, while `start` remains unchanged as it is determined by the maximum of `l1` and `l2`.
