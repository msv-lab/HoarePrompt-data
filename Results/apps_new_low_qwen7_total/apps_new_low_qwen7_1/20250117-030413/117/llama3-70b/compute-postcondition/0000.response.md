The given code snippet takes five integers as input (l1, r1, l2, r2, k) and assigns them to the variables `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` respectively. It then calculates the `start` variable as the maximum of `l1` and `l2` and the `end` variable as the minimum of `r1` and `r2`.

Since the initial state is defined by the conditions 1 ≤ l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, k ≤ 10^18, l_1 ≤ r_1, and l_2 ≤ r_2, we know these conditions must hold true after the input is processed. However, the exact values of `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`, and `k` depend on the user's input, which is not provided here. We can still describe the final state in terms of the operations performed.

The final state after running the code will be:
- `l1` is set to the value of the first input integer.
- `r1` is set to the value of the second input integer.
- `l2` is set to the value of the third input integer.
- `r2` is set to the value of the fourth input integer.
- `k` is set to the value of the fifth input integer.
- `start` is calculated as `max(l1, l2)`.
- `end` is calculated as `min(r1, r2)`.

Given the above, the final output state is:
Output State: **l1 is input value 1, r1 is input value 2, l2 is input value 3, r2 is input value 4, k is input value 5, start is max(input value 1, input value 3), end is min(input value 2, input value 4)**
