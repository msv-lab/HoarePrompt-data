The code subtracts 1 from the value of `end`. Given that the initial state is `start` is the maximum of `l1` (input value 1) and `l2` (input value 3), and `end` is the minimum of `r1` (input value 2) and `r2` (input value 4), the new value of `end` will be `min(r1, r2) - 1`.

So, the updated states are:
- `start` remains unchanged, as it is determined by the maximum of `l1` and `l2`.
- `end` is now `min(r1, r2) - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`start` is the maximum of `l1` and `l2`, `end` is `min(r1, r2) - 1`, `k` is input value 5, `l1` is input value 1, `r1` is input value 2, `l2` is input value 3, `r2` is input value 4.**
