The given code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print(current_count - n)`
2. `break`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the variables:

- The first line `print(current_count - n)` calculates the difference between `current_count` and `n` and prints it. Since `current_count` is `n + 2`, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) - n`, which equals 2. Therefore, the print statement outputs `2`.
- The second line `break` is typically used in loops to exit the loop early. However, since there is no loop present in this code block, `break` does not have any effect on the variables or the output state.

Given the initial state where `current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, `current_count` is n + 2, and `current_average` is current_sum / current_count, these variables remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Output State: **current_sum is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, current_count is n + 2, current_average is current_sum / current_count, the printed output is 2**
