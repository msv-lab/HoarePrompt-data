Postcondition: ***`current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, `current_count` is `n + 1`, and `current_average` is `current_sum / (n + 1)`. If `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`, then the condition is met. If `math.ceil(current_average) < k`, no additional information about changes is provided since there is no else part specified.***
