The given code block consists of two lines:

1. `print(current_count - n)`
2. `break`

Let's analyze the effects of these lines on the variables and the overall state.

### Line 1: `print(current_count - n)`
- The variable `current_count` is set to `n` initially.
- The expression `current_count - n` evaluates to `n - n`, which is `0`.
- This value is printed to the console.

### Line 2: `break`
- The `break` statement is typically used to exit a loop. However, there is no loop in the provided code block, so this statement does not change the state of any variables or the flow of execution outside the context of a loop.

Since there is no loop and no further assignment or modification of variables, the only effect of the code block is the printing of `0`.

### Final Output State
Given that no variables are modified and the only effect is the print statement, the final state remains as follows:

Output State: **current_count is n, current_sum is the sum of all integers in marks, current_average is current_sum / n, and the output of the print statement is 0**.

However, since we need to update the state based on the actual values before running the code and considering the code does not change the state beyond printing, the final state in terms of updated variables is:

Output State: **current_count is n, current_sum is the sum of all integers in marks, current_average is current_sum / n, and the output is 0**.
