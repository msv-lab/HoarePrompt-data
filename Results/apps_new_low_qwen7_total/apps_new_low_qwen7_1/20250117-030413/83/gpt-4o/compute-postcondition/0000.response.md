Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, marks is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ k, current_sum is the sum of all integers in marks, current_count is n**

Explanation:
- The first line takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This updates the values of `n` and `k`.
- The second line takes a list of integers as input and assigns it to `marks`. This updates the list `marks`.
- The third line calculates the sum of all integers in the list `marks` and assigns this value to `current_sum`. This updates `current_sum`.
- The fourth line initializes `current_count` with the value of `n`. This updates `current_count`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, and `current_count` are not provided, the output state is described in terms of their constraints and initializations.
