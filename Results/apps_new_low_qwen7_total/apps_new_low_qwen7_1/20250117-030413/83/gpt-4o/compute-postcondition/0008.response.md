The code calculates the `current_average` by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given the initial state, `current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, and `current_count` is `n + 1`. Since no new values are assigned to `marks` or `k`, and `n` remains within its bounds, the output state will reflect the calculation of `current_average`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, `current_count` is `n + 1`, `current_average` is `current_sum / (n + 1)`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\)**
