Initial State: `current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, `current_count` is n + 2. If `math.ceil(current_average) >= k`, the printed output is 2. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables and the printed output is not specified.

Code Block:
```
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `current_sum += k` increments the value of `current_sum` by `k`.
2. The second line `current_count += 1` increments the value of `current_count` by 1.

Since these lines do not depend on any external input or conditions (like the `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` condition), they will simply perform the operations as specified.

Final State Calculation:
- `current_sum` originally was the original sum of marks plus 2*k. After adding `k`, it becomes the original sum of marks plus 3*k.
- `current_count` originally was `n + 2`. After adding 1, it becomes `n + 3`.

No other variables are affected, and since there is no condition that prints anything based on the current state, the output is not specified by this code block alone.

Output State: **current_sum is the original sum of marks plus 3*k, current_count is n + 3**
