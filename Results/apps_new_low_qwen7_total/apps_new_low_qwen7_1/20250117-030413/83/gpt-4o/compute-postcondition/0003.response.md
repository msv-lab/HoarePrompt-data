Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `marks` is a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ k, `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`, `current_count` is n, `current_average` is \(\text{current\_sum} / n\), and the current average \(\text{current\_average}\) rounded up is greater than or equal to k**
