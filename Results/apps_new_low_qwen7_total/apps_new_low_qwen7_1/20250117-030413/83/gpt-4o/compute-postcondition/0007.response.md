The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on variables, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the loop itself is entered. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, `current_count` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\)**
