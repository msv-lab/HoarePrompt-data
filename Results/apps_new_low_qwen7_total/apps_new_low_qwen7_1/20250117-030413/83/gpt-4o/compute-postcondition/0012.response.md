For the given `while True` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that determine whether the loop can execute. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute as long as the loop body allows. However, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop body has enough information to proceed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k
- `current_count` is n + 2
- `current_average` is `current_sum / (n + 2)`

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to make sure that the loop body has the necessary information to calculate the new values for `current_sum`, `current_count`, and `current_average`.

Since the loop is `while True`, no specific adjustments are needed for the loop condition itself. The only thing we need to ensure is that the loop body has the correct state to proceed with the next iteration.

State: **`current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, `current_count` is n + 2, and `current_average` is current_sum / (n + 2)**
