Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`. It also reads a list `marks` of `n` integers, each satisfying `1 ≤ a_i ≤ k`. The function calculates the minimum number of additional integers (each equal to `k`) that need to be added to the list so that the average of the combined list becomes at least `k`. If such a combination cannot be achieved, the function returns `-1`.**

**After executing the function, the program state will be:**
- The variable `current_sum` contains the sum of the initial list `marks` plus `k` times the number of additional elements added during the loop.
- The variable `current_count` contains the total number of elements in the combined list (original `n` elements plus the additional elements).
- If the average of the combined list is at least `k`, the function prints and returns `current_count - n`, which represents the minimum number of additional elements needed.
- If no such combination can achieve an average of at least `k`, the function returns `-1`.
