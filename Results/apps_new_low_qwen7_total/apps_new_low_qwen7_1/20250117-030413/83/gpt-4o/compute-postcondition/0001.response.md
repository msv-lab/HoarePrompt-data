Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of the variables `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, and `current_count` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `marks` is a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ k, `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`, `current_count` is n**
