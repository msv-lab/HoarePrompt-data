Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `marks` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq k\), `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`, `current_count` is `n`, and `current_average` is `current_sum / n`. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the output is 0. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is less than `k`, the program continues without changing any variables' values.

The code snippet provided is:
```
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

Let's analyze the effects of these lines of code on the given state:

1. **Update `current_sum`:**
   - Initially, `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`.
   - After executing `current_sum += k`, `current_sum` becomes the original sum of `marks` plus `k`.

2. **Update `current_count`:**
   - Initially, `current_count` is `n`.
   - After executing `current_count += 1`, `current_count` becomes `n + 1`.

Since `math.ceil(current_average)` being greater than or equal to `k` would cause the output to be 0 and terminate the program, and since the code continues without any conditional check, the variables `current_sum` and `current_count` are updated. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified in the code.

The final state after running the provided code block is:
Output State: **`current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, `current_count` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\)**.
