Output State: **current_sum is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, current_count is n + 2, and current_average is current_sum / (n + 2)**

Explanation: The code block consists of two lines that increment `current_sum` by `k` and `current_count` by 1. This means that `current_sum` is increased by `k` and `current_count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus `k`, and `current_count` is `n + 1`. After executing these two lines, `current_sum` will be the original sum of `marks` plus `2*k`, and `current_count` will be `n + 2`. The value of `current_average` is recalculated as `current_sum / (n + 2)`.
