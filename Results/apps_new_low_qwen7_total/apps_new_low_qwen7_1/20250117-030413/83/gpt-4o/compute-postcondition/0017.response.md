Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- \( k \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 100 \)
- \( \text{marks} \) is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq k \)
- \( \text{current\_sum} \) is the sum of all integers in \( \text{marks} \)
- \( \text{current\_count} \) is \( n \)

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met. Inside the loop:
1. Calculate `current_average` as `current_sum / current_count`.
2. Check if `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to \( k \).
3. If the condition is false, increment `current_sum` by \( k \) and `current_count` by 1.
4. If the condition is true, print `current_count - n` and break the loop.

### Tracking Variable Changes:
- \( n \) and \( k \) remain constant throughout the loop.
- \( \text{current\_sum} \) increases by \( k \) each time the loop iterates.
- \( \text{current\_count} \) increases by 1 each time the loop iterates.
- \( \text{marks} \) and \( \text{current\_average} \) are not directly manipulated but used in the condition check.

### Loop Behavior Summary:
- The loop increments `current_sum` and `current_count` by `k` and `1` respectively until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is satisfied.
- The loop will continue as long as the average (rounded up) of the updated sum is less than \( k \).

### Verification of Relationships:
- After the loop executes \( t \) times, `current_sum` is the original sum of `marks` plus \( t \times k \).
- `current_count` is \( n + t \).
- The condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` ensures that the loop exits once the average (rounded up) meets or exceeds \( k \).

### Final Output State:
To determine the final state after the loop, we need to find the smallest \( t \) such that `math.ceil((current_sum + t * k) / (n + t)) >= k`.

Since `current_sum` is the sum of `marks`, let's denote it as `S`. Therefore, the condition becomes:
\[ \text{math.ceil}\left(\frac{S + t \cdot k}{n + t}\right) \geq k \]

This inequality can be simplified to:
\[ \frac{S + t \cdot k}{n + t} \geq k \]
\[ S + t \cdot k \geq k \cdot (n + t) \]
\[ S + t \cdot k \geq k \cdot n + t \cdot k \]
\[ S \geq k \cdot n \]

Thus, the loop will terminate when the sum `S` plus `t \cdot k` is large enough to satisfy this condition. The exact value of `t` depends on the specific values of `S` and `k`, but we know it will be the smallest integer `t` that satisfies the inequality.

### Final Output State:
- \( \text{current\_sum} = S + t \cdot k \)
- \( \text{current\_count} = n + t \)
- \( n \) and \( k \) remain as initial values.

The loop will stop when the sum of the adjusted values meets the condition, and the final printed value is `current_count - n`.

Output State: **current\_sum = S + t \cdot k, current\_count = n + t, n, k**
