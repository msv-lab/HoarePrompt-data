The code calculates the current average by dividing the current sum (`current_sum`) by the current count (`current_count`). Since `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks` and `current_count` is the number of elements in `marks` (which is `n`), the current average is calculated as `current_average = current_sum / n`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, and `current_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `current_average`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `marks` is a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ k, `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`, `current_count` is n, `current_average` is current_sum / n**
