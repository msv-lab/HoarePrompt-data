The given code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print(current_count - n)`
2. `break`

Let's analyze each line:

### First Line: `print(current_count - n)`
- `current_count` is initially set to `n + 1`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- Therefore, `current_count` is `n + 1`.

When we subtract `n` from `current_count`, we get:
\[ current_count - n = (n + 1) - n = 1 \]

So, the output of the `print` statement will be `1`.

### Second Line: `break`
- The `break` statement is typically used to exit a loop, but it is placed here outside any loop context. This line effectively ends the program execution immediately after printing `1`.

### Final Output State
- After executing the `print` statement, the value of `current_count` is reduced by `n`, resulting in `1`.
- `current_average` is not mentioned to be recalculated or updated by this code block, so it remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are not mentioned to be updated by this code block, so they remain unchanged.
- `current_sum` is also not mentioned to be updated by this code block, so it remains unchanged.

Output State: **current_count is 1, current_average is current_sum / (n + 1), n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, current_sum is the original sum of marks plus k**
