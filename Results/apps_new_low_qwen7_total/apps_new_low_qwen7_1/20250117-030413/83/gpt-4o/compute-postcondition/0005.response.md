Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `marks` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ `k`, `current_sum` is the sum of all integers in `marks`, `current_count` is `n`, `current_average` is `current_sum` / `n`. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the output is 0. If `math.ceil(current_average)` is less than `k`, the program continues without changing any variables' values.***
