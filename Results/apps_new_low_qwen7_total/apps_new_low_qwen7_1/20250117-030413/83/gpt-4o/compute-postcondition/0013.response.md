The code `current_average = current_sum / current_count` updates the value of `current_average` by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. According to the initial state, `current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, and `current_count` is n + 2.

Since both `current_sum` and `current_count` are updated in this line of code, the new value of `current_average` will be calculated as follows:

- `current_average` is now `current_sum / current_count`.

The values of `current_sum` and `current_count` remain the same as they were before the calculation.

Output State: **`current_sum` is the original sum of marks plus 2*k, `current_count` is n + 2, and `current_average` is current_sum / current_count**
