The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The list `a` has a length `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ k`. Additionally, `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`.

Case_1: The function returns a specific value or result based on the elements in the list `a`.
Case_2: The function returns a different specific value or result based on the elements in the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and `k`, and based on the elements in the list, the function returns a specific value or result.
