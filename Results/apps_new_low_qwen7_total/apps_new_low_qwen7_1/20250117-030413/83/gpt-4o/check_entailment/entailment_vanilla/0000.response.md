### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of marks `n` and the maximum possible mark `k`, followed by reading the list of marks `marks`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `current_sum` is initialized to the sum of the initial marks.
   - `current_count` is initialized to the number of initial marks (`n`).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the condition in the `if` statement is met.
   - In each iteration, the current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - `math.ceil(current_average)` is used to round the average up to the nearest integer.
   - If the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `current_count - n` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, the loop adds `k` to `current_sum` and increments `current_count`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimal number of additional marks needed to make the final average at least `k`.

The logic is sound as it correctly calculates the minimal number of additional marks required to achieve the desired final mark. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the average is rounded up correctly. The loop continues until the condition is satisfied, ensuring that the minimal number of additional marks is found.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases such as when the initial average is already greater than or equal to `k`.
- The loop incrementally increases the sum and count until the condition is met.
- The solution ensures that the minimal number of additional marks is added.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
