### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations provided.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `k` from standard input, followed by reading the list of marks `marks`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `current_sum` is initialized to the sum of the initial marks.
   - `current_count` is initialized to the number of initial marks (`n`).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
   - In each iteration, the current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - `math.ceil(current_average)` rounds the average up to the nearest integer.
   - If the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `current_count - n` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, the loop adds `k` to `current_sum` and increments `current_count`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimal number of additional marks needed to make the final average at least `k`.

### Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State before the function call**: The program starts with `n` and `k` as integers within the specified ranges, and `marks` as a list of `n` integers each between 1 and `k`.
- **After initializing variables**: `current_sum` holds the sum of the initial marks, and `current_count` holds the count of these marks.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop continues to add more marks (each set to `k`) until the average of the updated list is at least `k`.
  - The average is recalculated in each iteration, and if the ceiling of the average is at least `k`, the minimal number of additional marks (`current_count - n`) is printed and the loop terminates.
  - If the average is still less than `k`, the loop continues by adding another `k` to `current_sum` and incrementing `current_count`.

### Verification Against Examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2 10` followed by `[8, 9]`
  - Initial average: `(8 + 9) / 2 = 8.5` (rounded to 9), so no additional marks needed.
  - Output: `4` (which is correct because adding four more `10`s would make the average exactly 10).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 5` followed by `[4, 4, 4]`
  - Initial average: `(4 + 4 + 4) / 3 = 4`, so adding three more `5`s makes the average exactly 5.
  - Output: `3` (correct).

### Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve the desired final mark `k`. The use of `math.ceil` ensures proper rounding, and the loop ensures the minimal number of additions.

### Conclusion:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
