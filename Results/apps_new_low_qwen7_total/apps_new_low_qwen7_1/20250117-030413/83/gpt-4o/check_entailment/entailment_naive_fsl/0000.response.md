Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where adding the minimum number of marks could still result in a final average that rounds down instead of up. Specifically, consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
3 10
9 9 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, Noora already has three marks, each being 9. The current average is 9, and rounding to the nearest integer would still give 9, which is less than 10. According to the problem description, Noora needs a final mark of 10, so Leha needs to add at least one mark of 10 to make the average at least 10. However, the program incorrectly outputs 0, indicating it believes no additional marks are needed.

This indicates that the program does not correctly account for the rounding rules specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
