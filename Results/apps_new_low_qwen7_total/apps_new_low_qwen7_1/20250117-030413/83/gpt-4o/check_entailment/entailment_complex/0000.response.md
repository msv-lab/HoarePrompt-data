Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads `n` and `k` from standard input using `map(int, input().split())`, and then reads the list of `n` integers `marks`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Initial Variables and Calculation**:
   - `current_sum` and `current_count` are initialized to the initial sum and count of the marks respectively.
   - The while loop continues until the current average of the marks is at least `k`.

3. **Average Calculation and Rounding**:
   - Inside the loop, the current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - The function uses `math.ceil` to round the average to the nearest integer, ensuring that any value of 7.5 and above rounds up to the next integer, which fits the problem requirement.

4. **Condition for Breaking the Loop**:
   - The loop breaks when the current average, after being ceilinged, is at least `k`. This condition ensures that the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve the desired average is found.

5. **Adding Additional Marks**:
   - Each iteration adds one more mark (`k`) to both `current_sum` and `current_count`.
   - The number of additional marks required is calculated as `current_count - n`, which represents the number of times `k` was added.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of additional marks required, which is correct based on the logic described.

Given the logical correctness of the implementation and the proper handling of the problem constraints, the function appears to be correctly solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
