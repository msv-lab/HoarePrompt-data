Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of marks.
2. It calculates the initial sum and count of marks.
3. It enters a loop to incrementally add marks (`k`) until the average of the updated list meets the condition of being at least `k`.
4. The condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` checks if the current average, when rounded up, is at least `k`.
5. When this condition is met, the function prints the difference between the current count and the original count `n`, which represents the minimal number of additional marks needed.
6. The logic for calculating the minimal number of additional marks seems sound and should work as intended.

Given the summary and the reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implementing the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
