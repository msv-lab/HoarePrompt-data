### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided solution using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `k` from standard input.
   - It also reads the list of marks `marks` from standard input.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `current_sum` is initialized to the sum of the initial marks.
   - `current_count` is initialized to the number of initial marks (`n`).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
   - In each iteration, the current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - `math.ceil(current_average)` is used to round the average up to the nearest integer.
   - If the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `current_count - n` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, the loop adds `k` to `current_sum` and increments `current_count`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimal number of additional marks needed to make the final average at least `k`.

However, let's consider a few scenarios to ensure the solution works correctly:

#### Scenario 1: Initial Average is Already Sufficient
- Example Input: `2 10`
  - Marks: `[10, 10]`
  - Current Sum: 20
  - Current Count: 2
  - Current Average: 10
  - No additional marks needed.

#### Scenario 2: Initial Average is Not Sufficient
- Example Input: `2 10`
  - Marks: `[8, 9]`
  - Current Sum: 17
  - Current Count: 2
  - Current Average: 8.5
  - Ceiling of Current Average: 9
  - Additional Marks Needed: 4 (to reach an average of 10)

#### Scenario 3: Initial Average is Slightly Below k
- Example Input: `3 5`
  - Marks: `[4, 4, 4]`
  - Current Sum: 12
  - Current Count: 3
  - Current Average: 4
  - Ceiling of Current Average: 4
  - Additional Marks Needed: 3 (to reach an average of 5)

#### Issue with the Solution
- The main issue lies in the loop termination condition. The loop only terminates when the ceiling of the current average is exactly `k`. This means the loop might not terminate if the initial average is slightly below `k` and adding one more mark does not bring the average to `k` directly.
- The loop should continue until the average is at least `k` without relying solely on the ceiling function.

#### Correct Approach
- The solution should increment the sum and count until the average is at least `k` without prematurely breaking out of the loop.

### Corrected Solution
```python
import math

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    current_sum = sum(marks)
    current_count = n
    additional_marks_needed = 0
    
    while True:
        current_average = current_sum / current_count
        if current_average >= k:
            break
        current_sum += k
        current_count += 1
        additional_marks_needed += 1
    
    print(additional_marks_needed)
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected solution ensures that the loop continues until the average is at least `k`.
- It keeps track of the number of additional marks needed and prints the result.

### Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
