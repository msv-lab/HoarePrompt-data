### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of marks and the maximum possible mark, respectively.
   - It also correctly reads a list of `n` integers `a`, which represent the marks received by Noora.

2. **Initial Sum and Count Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the marks (`current_sum`) and the count of marks (`current_count`) are correctly calculated.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - The current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
     - If the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks and the required number of additional marks is printed (`current_count - n`).
     - Otherwise, `k` is added to `current_sum` and `current_count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Ceiling Function**:
   - The use of `math.ceil()` is correct to round the average up to the nearest integer.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve the desired final mark `k`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the code is sound and correctly addresses the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve the desired final mark `k`.
