The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output depends on some internal conditions related to variables that are not provided in the given snippet. Based on the constraints, the function likely involves processing the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). However, since no specific operations or return values are provided, we can only describe the parameter constraints.

Given the lack of specific details about the return values, we can infer the following:

- The function accepts two variables `n` and `k` with the specified constraints.
- The function's output is not defined in the given snippet, so we cannot specify a return value without additional information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but processes variables `n` and `k` with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).**
