The code `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `divisors` or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n`, including each divisor exactly once, and it is sorted in ascending order; `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`; the console displays `-1`.**
