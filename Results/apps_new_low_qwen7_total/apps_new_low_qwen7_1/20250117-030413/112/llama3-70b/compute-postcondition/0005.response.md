The code appends `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `n` is divisible by 1, and `divisors` is `[1]`. Since `i` is 1, `n // i` is simply `n`. The current value of `i * i` is not equal to `n`, so this condition is satisfied.

After executing the line `divisors.append(n // i)`, `divisors` will be `[1, n]` because `1 // 1` is `1`, and `n // 1` is `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is divisible by 1, and `divisors` is `[1, n]`**
