Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `divisors` is either `[1]` (if `1 * 1 != n`) or `[1, n]` (if `1 * 1 == n`), otherwise `divisors` remains unchanged

### For Loop
```python
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

### Determining `n` and `divisors`
- The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `divisors` depends on the initial value of `n`:
  - If `1 * 1 != n`, then `divisors` is `[1]`.
  - If `1 * 1 == n`, then `divisors` is `[1, n]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can only say that `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the condition for `divisors` remains the same.

### Updated State
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`, and `n` will still be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `divisors` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is either `[1]` (if `1 * 1 != n`) or `[1, n]` (if `1 * 1 == n`).**
