Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and the range function.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.

4. **Determine the Initial Value of `n`**: Since `i` starts from 1, `n` must be at least 1 (but it is already given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15`).

5. **Range Function and Integer Square Root**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be 1 on the first iteration, and we need to ensure that `n` is such that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid number that allows `i` to be incremented.

6. **Initial State of `divisors`**: The list `divisors` is initially empty and remains unchanged by the loop body, so it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.

Given the above points, let's formulate the state:

- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but more specifically, it must be such that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid value that allows `i` to start at 1.
- `k` is not involved in the loop condition and its value does not directly affect the loop's first execution.
- `divisors` being an empty list is irrelevant to the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the initial state for the loop to execute the first time should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1 (to ensure `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is a valid number), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is an empty list**
