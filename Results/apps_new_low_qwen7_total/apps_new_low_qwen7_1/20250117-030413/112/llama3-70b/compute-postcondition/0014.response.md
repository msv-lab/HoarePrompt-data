The code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Initially, `i` is 3. Based on the conditions given in the initial state, `divisors` can either be `[1, 2, n // 2]` or `[1, n, 2, n // 2]`. In both cases, since `i` is 3, it will be appended to `divisors`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `divisors` is `[1, 2, n // 2]`, after appending `i` (which is 3), the new `divisors` will be `[1, 2, n // 2, 3]`.
2. If `divisors` is `[1, n, 2, n // 2]`, after appending `i` (which is 3), the new `divisors` will be `[1, n, 2, n // 2, 3]`.

In both scenarios, `i` remains 3, and the list `divisors` gets updated accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `divisors` is either `[1, 2, n // 2, 3]` or `[1, n, 2, n // 2, 3]`**
