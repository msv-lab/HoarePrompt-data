Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `divisors` is either `[1, 2, n // 2]` (if `1 * 1 != n` and `n % i == 0`) or `[1, n, 2, n // 2]` (if `1 * 1 == n` and `n % i == 0`).

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `3`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`, which increases by `1` each iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `3` for the next iteration.

6. **Determine the new state of `n` and `divisors`:**
   - The values of `n` and `divisors` do not change within the loop head. Therefore, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is either `[1, 2, n // 2]` (if `1 * 1 != n` and `n % i == 0`) or `[1, n, 2, n // 2]` (if `1 * 1 == n` and `n % i == 0`).**
