The code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 1 and divisible by `i`, the initial value of `i` remains unchanged. After executing the line of code, `i` is still 1, and `n` remains at its initial value which is divisible by 1. Therefore, `divisors` now contains the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is divisible by 1, and `divisors` is [1]**
