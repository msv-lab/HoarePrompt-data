The `sort()` method is called on the `divisors` list, which sorts the list in ascending order. Since the initial state specifies that `divisors` contains all divisors of `n`, including each divisor exactly once, the sorting operation does not change the content of the list but only changes its order. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the list `divisors` is now sorted.

Output State: **`divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n`, including each divisor exactly once, and it is sorted in ascending order.**
