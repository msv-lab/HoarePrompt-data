The provided code snippet takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, from the user and stores them in variables `n` and `k` respectively. After that, it initializes an empty list `divisors`. However, no further operations are performed on `n` or `k` within the given code block.

Since the code does not alter the values of `n` and `k` (they remain as input values), and no new information about their values is provided, we cannot update their specific values without user input. But based on the precondition, we know `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, divisors is an empty list**
