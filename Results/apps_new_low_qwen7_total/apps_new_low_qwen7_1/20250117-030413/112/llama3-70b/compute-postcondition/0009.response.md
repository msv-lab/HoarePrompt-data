The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `i` is 2 and the initial state of `divisors` is either `[1]` (if `1 * 1 != n`) or `[1, n]` (if `1 * 1 == n`), we need to consider both cases:

1. If `1 * 1 != n`, then `divisors` is `[1]`.
2. If `1 * 1 == n`, then `divisors` is `[1, n]`.

In both cases, appending `i` (which is 2) to `divisors` results in:
- `[1, 2]` if `1 * 1 != n`
- `[1, n, 2]` if `1 * 1 == n`

The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is either `[1, 2]` (if `1 * 1 != n`) or `[1, n, 2]` (if `1 * 1 == n`).**
