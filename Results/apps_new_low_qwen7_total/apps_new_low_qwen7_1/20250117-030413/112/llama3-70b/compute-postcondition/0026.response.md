Functionality: **The function processes two variables, `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). It calculates and prints the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n`. If `n` is a prime number or if `k` exceeds the total number of divisors of `n`, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the program will have determined and printed the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n` if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. Note that the function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, sorts the list of divisors, and then checks and prints the required divisor based on the value of `k`.**
