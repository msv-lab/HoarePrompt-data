Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: The program iterates from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors of `n`. This is efficient because each time a divisor `i` is found, `n // i` is also a divisor, and it avoids redundant checks.
3. **Sorting Divisors**: The list of divisors is sorted in ascending order, which is necessary to correctly identify the `k`-th smallest divisor.
4. **Output Handling**: 
   - If there are fewer than `k` divisors, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it correctly outputs the `k`-th smallest divisor.

Given the provided problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the requirements. It correctly identifies all divisors, sorts them, and outputs the appropriate result based on the value of `k`.

Correctness: **True**
