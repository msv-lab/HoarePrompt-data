Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

# Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])





# Execution Summary:
The function processes two variables, `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). It calculates and prints the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n`. If `n` is a prime number or if `k` exceeds the total number of divisors of `n`, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the program will have determined and printed the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n` if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. Note that the function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, sorts the list of divisors, and then checks and prints the required divisor based on the value of `k`.
