Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` from standard input.
2. It generates a list of all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and ensures each divisor is included exactly once by checking both `i` and `n // i`.
3. The list of divisors is then sorted in ascending order.
4. The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that the `k`-th smallest divisor does not exist.
5. If `k` is within the range of the number of divisors, the program prints the `k`-th smallest divisor.

Given the steps above, the program appears to follow the logic specified in the problem statement accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions that would make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
