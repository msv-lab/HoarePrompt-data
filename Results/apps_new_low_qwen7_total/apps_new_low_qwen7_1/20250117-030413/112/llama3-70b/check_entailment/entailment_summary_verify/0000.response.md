### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the function summary and the examples given.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function calculates all divisors of `n` up to its square root.
   - Divisors are stored in a list `divisors`.
   - The list is sorted.
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the length of the divisors list. If so, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor from the list.

2. **Edge Cases and Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
     - Divisors of 4: 1, 2, 4
     - Sorted: [1, 2, 4]
     - 2nd smallest divisor is 2. Correctly outputs 2.
   - **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `k = 3`
     - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
     - Sorted: [1, 5]
     - Since 3 > length of divisors list (2), outputs -1. Correct.
   - **Example 3**: `n = 12`, `k = 5`
     - Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
     - Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
     - 5th smallest divisor is 6. Correctly outputs 6.
   - **Example Rejected in Original Assessment**: `n = 25`, `k = 3`
     - Divisors of 25: 1, 5, 25
     - Sorted: [1, 5, 25]
     - Length of list is 3, `k` is 3. The program should output -1 because there is no 3rd smallest divisor. However, the program prints 25 due to the logic in the loop.

3. **Original Assessment Critique**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified a flaw in the program's handling of the specific edge case where `n` is a perfect square and `k` equals the length of the divisors list. In this case, the program incorrectly prints the last element instead of -1.
   - However, the program does correctly handle most cases and provides the expected output for non-square numbers and when `k` is within the bounds of the divisors list.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program works correctly for the majority of cases, including cases where `n` is not a perfect square and where `k` is less than the length of the divisors list.
   - The specific edge case of a perfect square `n` with `k` equal to the length of the divisors list is a valid concern, but the program handles other cases accurately.

Given this analysis, the program can be considered mostly correct but has a minor flaw in handling the edge case mentioned.

### Final Evaluation
