You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes two variables, `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). It calculates and prints the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n`. If `n` is a prime number or if `k` exceeds the total number of divisors of `n`, the function prints `-1`. After the function executes, the program will have determined and printed the \(k\)-th smallest divisor of `n` if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. Note that the function reads `n` and `k` from standard input, sorts the list of divisors, and then checks and prints the required divisor based on the value of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This matches the expected input format.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors.
   - For each divisor `i` found, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the list `divisors` to account for pairs of divisors (e.g., for `n = 12`, the pairs are `(1, 12)`, `(2, 6)`, and `(3, 4)`).
   - This approach ensures that all divisors are captured, including the square root if `n` is a perfect square.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The program sorts the list of divisors, which is necessary to ensure they are in ascending order.

4. **Checking the k-th Divisor**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that the `k`-th divisor does not exist.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n` or return `-1` if fewer than `k` divisors exist.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.
