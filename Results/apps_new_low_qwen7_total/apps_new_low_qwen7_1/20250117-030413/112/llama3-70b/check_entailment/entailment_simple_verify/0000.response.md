### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The program iterates over the range from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` using `n % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list.
   - If `i * i` is not equal to `n`, it also appends `n // i` to ensure each divisor is included exactly once.
   - This part of the program correctly finds all divisors of `n`.

3. **Sorting the Divisors:**
   - The program sorts the `divisors` list in ascending order.
   - Sorting ensures that the divisors are in the correct order for determining the k-th smallest divisor.
   - This part is correct.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - After sorting, the program checks if `k` is greater than the length of the `divisors` list.
   - If `k` is greater, it prints `-1`, indicating that `n` has fewer than `k` divisors.
   - If `k` is not greater, it prints `divisors[k - 1]`, which is the k-th smallest divisor.
   - This part is correct, but let's review the logic in detail.

Given the above analysis, the program should correctly identify the k-th smallest divisor or print `-1` if there are fewer than `k` divisors. The original assessment claimed that the program fails in certain cases, but upon closer inspection, the program's logic seems sound.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 2`
   - Divisors of 4: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 4]`
   - `k = 2`, which is within the length of the list.
   - Output: `2` (correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 3`
   - Divisors of 5: `[1, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 5]`
   - `k = 3`, which is greater than the length of the list.
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `25 3`
   - Divisors of 25: `[1, 5, 25]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 5, 25]`
   - `k = 3`, which is within the length of the list.
   - Output: `25` (correct, as per the problem statement, the third smallest divisor is 25)

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program fails in certain cases, but upon reviewing the code and examples, it appears that the program works correctly according to the problem statement. The program handles all given test cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and examples.
