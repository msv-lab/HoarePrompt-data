You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n`, including each divisor exactly once.
    divisors.sort()
    if (k > len(divisors)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(divisors[k - 1])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n`, including each divisor exactly once, and it is sorted in ascending order; if `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, the console displays `-1`. Otherwise, the value of `divisors[k - 1]` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is larger than the total number of divisors of `n`. Specifically, the program sorts the divisors and checks if `k` is greater than the length of the divisors list before printing the result. However, this check is insufficient because the loop to find divisors only goes up to the square root of `n`, which might miss some divisors if `n` has a large number of them. For instance, consider the input:

```
25 3
```

The divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The program will correctly identify these divisors but then check if `k` (which is 3 in this case) is greater than the length of the divisors list, which is 3. Since `k` equals the length of the list, the program incorrectly prints the last element (25) instead of -1, as there is no third smallest divisor. Thus, the program does not work correctly for this case.
