### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This matches the expected input format.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors.
   - For each divisor `i` found, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the list `divisors` to account for pairs of divisors (e.g., for `n = 12`, the pairs are `(1, 12)`, `(2, 6)`, and `(3, 4)`).
   - This approach ensures that all divisors are captured, including the square root if `n` is a perfect square.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The program sorts the list of divisors, which is necessary to ensure they are in ascending order.

4. **Checking the k-th Divisor**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that the `k`-th divisor does not exist.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n` or return `-1` if fewer than `k` divisors exist.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
