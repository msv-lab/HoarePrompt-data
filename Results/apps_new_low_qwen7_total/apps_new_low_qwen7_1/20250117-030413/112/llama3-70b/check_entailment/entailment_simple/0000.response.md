### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors of `n`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it appends `i` to the list of divisors and, if `i` is not a perfect square, it also appends `n // i` to ensure all divisors are included.
   - This approach ensures that each divisor is added exactly once, even if `n` is a perfect square.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - After finding all divisors, the list `divisors` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the divisors are in the correct order when accessed.

4. **Checking the k-th Divisor**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If `k` is greater, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are fewer than `k` divisors.
   - If `k` is within the bounds of the `divisors` list, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor, which is at index `k - 1`.

Given this analysis, the provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n`.
