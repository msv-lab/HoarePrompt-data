### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version step-by-step.

1. **Input Reading and Divisor Calculation:**
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then initializes an empty list `divisors` to store the divisors of `n`.
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors. For each divisor `i`, it appends both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors` list (if `i * i` is not equal to `n` to avoid duplicates).

2. **Sorting and Output:**
   - After collecting all divisors, the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then checks if `k` is greater than the length of the `divisors` list.
     - If `k` is greater, it prints `-1` indicating that `k`-th smallest divisor does not exist.
     - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor from the sorted list.

3. **Annotation Verification:**
   - The annotation states that the program calculates and prints the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n` if it exists, or `-1` otherwise.
   - The annotation also mentions that the program reads `n` and `k` from standard input, sorts the list of divisors, and then checks and prints the required divisor based on the value of `k`.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input: `25 3`
     - Divisors of 25 are `[1, 5, 25]`.
     - Sorted list: `[1, 5, 25]`.
     - Length of the list: 3.
     - `k` is 3, which is equal to the length of the list.
     - The program should print `-1` since the third smallest divisor does not exist.
   - However, the program mistakenly prints `25` because it checks `k` against the length of the list, which is correct, but the logic should return `-1` when `k` matches the length.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program indeed has a logical flaw where it incorrectly returns the last element when `k` equals the length of the `divisors` list, instead of returning `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaw mentioned in the original assessment.
