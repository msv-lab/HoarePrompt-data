### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This matches the expected input format.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find all divisors.
   - For each divisor `i` found, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the list `divisors` to account for pairs of divisors (e.g., for `n = 12`, the pairs are `(1, 12)`, `(2, 6)`, and `(3, 4)`).
   - This approach ensures that all divisors are captured, including the square root if `n` is a perfect square.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The program sorts the list of divisors, which is necessary to ensure they are in ascending order.

4. **Checking the k-th Divisor**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that the `k`-th divisor does not exist.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

### Evaluation:

1. **Correctness of Input Handling**:
   - The input handling is correct and follows the specified format.

2. **Finding All Divisors**:
   - The logic for finding all divisors up to the square root of `n` and adding both `i` and `n // i` is correct. This ensures that all divisors are included, even for perfect squares.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - Sorting the divisors is essential for determining the `k`-th smallest divisor. The program correctly sorts the list before checking the `k`-th element.

4. **Checking and Printing the k-th Divisor**:
   - The check to determine if there are enough divisors to satisfy `k` is correct. If `k` exceeds the number of divisors, `-1` is printed as required. Otherwise, the correct `k`-th divisor is printed.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n` or return `-1` if fewer than `k` divisors exist.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Final: True**
