Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is larger than the total number of divisors of `n`. Specifically, the program sorts the divisors and checks if `k` is greater than the length of the divisors list before printing the result. However, this check is insufficient because the loop to find divisors only goes up to the square root of `n`, which might miss some divisors if `n` has a large number of them. For instance, consider the input:

```
25 3
```

The divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The program will correctly identify these divisors but then check if `k` (which is 3 in this case) is greater than the length of the divisors list, which is 3. Since `k` equals the length of the list, the program incorrectly prints the last element (25) instead of -1, as there is no third smallest divisor. Thus, the program does not work correctly for this case.
