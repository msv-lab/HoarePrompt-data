You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output "YES" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
GGGGG

Output
YES

Input
4 3
BRG
BRG
BRG
BRG

Output
YES

Input
6 7
RRRGGGG
RRRGGGG
RRRGGGG
RRRBBBB
RRRBBBB
RRRBBBB

Output
NO

Input
4 4
RRRR
RRRR
BBBB
GGGG

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The field in the third example doesn't have three parralel stripes.

Rows of the field in the fourth example are parralel to each other and to borders. But they have different heights — 2, 1 and 1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))
    cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))
    print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the field is represented as a list of n strings, where each string consists of m characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

field = [input() for _ in range(n)]

rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))

cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for
    i in range(3))

print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly verify whether the given field satisfies the conditions of being a valid flag of Berland. Specifically, the program checks the number of unique rows and columns but does not ensure that the flag has exactly three parallel stripes of equal size and distinct colors.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
GGGGG
```

This input represents a valid flag of Berland, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because the number of unique rows and columns is 3, which is correct, but it fails to validate the structure of the stripes.

A correct solution would need to check that:
1. The field is divided into three equal stripes.
2. Each stripe is either 'R', 'G', or 'B' and no other characters.
3. Each color appears in exactly one stripe.

The provided program does not perform these validations, leading to incorrect outputs for valid flag configurations.
