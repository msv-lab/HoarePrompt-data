You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output "YES" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

-----Note-----

The field in the third example doesn't have three parralel stripes.

Rows of the field in the fourth example are parralel to each other and to borders. But they have different heights — 2, 1 and 1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))
    cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))
    print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the field is represented as a list of n strings, where each string consists of m characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

field = [input() for _ in range(n)]

rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))

cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for
    i in range(3))

print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The given program checks if the input field matches the criteria for a valid Berland flag.
2. It correctly divides the field into three stripes either horizontally or vertically and ensures that each stripe contains only one color and all stripes use unique colors.
3. The logic to check horizontal stripes is implemented with `rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))`, which works because it splits the field into three parts and checks if each part is unique.
4. The logic to check vertical stripes is implemented with `cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))`, which also correctly splits the field into three parts and checks if each part is unique.
5. The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met (three unique horizontal or vertical stripes), and "NO" otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the provided function appears to correctly validate the input against the Berland flag criteria.
