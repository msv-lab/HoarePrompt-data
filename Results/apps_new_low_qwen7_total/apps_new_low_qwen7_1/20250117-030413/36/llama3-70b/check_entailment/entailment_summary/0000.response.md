Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to verify if a given field meets the criteria of a valid Berland flag. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it tries to divide the field into 3x3 sub-grids rather than checking if the field consists of three parallel stripes with each stripe containing only one of the three colors.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Sub-grid Division**: The code attempts to create sub-grids by slicing the field in a way that does not align with the required structure of a Berland flag. Specifically, it tries to form 3x3 sub-grids from the entire field, which is not the intended approach.

2. **Lack of Stripe Validation**: The program does not check if the field has exactly three stripes parallel to each other and to the sides of the flag. Instead, it incorrectly tries to validate the presence of 3x3 sub-grids.

To correctly implement the validation, the program should:
- Ensure the field dimensions are divisible by 3.
- Verify that each of the three stripes (vertical or horizontal) contains only one color.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

    # Check if dimensions are divisible by 3
    if n % 3 != 0 or m % 3 != 0:
        print("NO")
        return

    # Check each stripe
    for i in range(3):
        stripe = set()
        for j in range(i * (n // 3), (i + 1) * (n // 3)):
            stripe.update(field[j][j % (m // 3):j % (m // 3) + (m // 3)])
        if len(stripe) != 3 or 'R' not in stripe or 'G' not in stripe or 'B' not in stripe:
            print("NO")
            return
    
    print("YES")

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version checks if the field dimensions are divisible by 3 and then verifies that each of the three stripes contains all three colors. If any of these conditions fail, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
