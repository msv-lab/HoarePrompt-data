### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if the given \( n \times m \) grid represents a valid flag of Berland, which must consist of three equal-sized horizontal or vertical stripes, each of a single color ('R', 'G', or 'B').

2. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes `n` and `m` from the input and reads the grid into `field`.
   - **Counting Rows and Columns**:
     - `rows` is calculated using `set` on horizontally aligned segments of the grid divided into thirds.
     - `cols` is calculated similarly but vertically, using segments of columns divided into thirds.
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - The condition checks if both `rows` and `cols` are 3, indicating three distinct stripes.
     - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Uneven Grids**: The solution correctly handles cases where the grid dimensions do not perfectly divide into three equal parts. It ensures that the segments are as close to equal as possible.
   - **Stripe Consistency**: By checking the sets of horizontally and vertically aligned segments, the solution ensures that each segment is a single color and that there are exactly three unique segments.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Valid Example**: In the first input, the grid clearly divides into three horizontal stripes of 'R', 'B', and 'G', so the output is "YES".
   - **Valid Example**: In the second input, the grid also divides into three vertical stripes of 'B', 'R', and 'G', so the output is "YES".
   - **Invalid Example**: In the third input, the grid does not have three parallel stripes, resulting in "NO".
   - **Invalid Example**: In the fourth input, the heights of the stripes are not equal, leading to "NO".

### Conclusion:
The logic of the function accurately checks whether the given grid meets the criteria for a valid Berland flag. The solution correctly handles all given test cases and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
