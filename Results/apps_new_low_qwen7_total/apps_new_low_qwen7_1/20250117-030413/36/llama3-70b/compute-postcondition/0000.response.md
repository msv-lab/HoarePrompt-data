The given code reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of a field and the field itself, which is represented as a list of `n` strings, each consisting of `m` characters ('R', 'G', 'B'). It then calculates the number of unique rows and columns considering every third row and column respectively, and prints 'YES' if both counts are 3, otherwise 'NO'. 

Since the initial state is not specified with actual values, we need to consider a generic case where the conditions can be met or not. Let's assume a valid scenario where the field is 9x9 and filled with 'R', 'G', and 'B' in a pattern that satisfies the condition (rows and columns have exactly 3 unique patterns).

For instance, let's take the following field as an example:

```
field = [
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB",
    "RGBRGBRGB"
]
```

Here, `n = 9` and `m = 9`.

1. `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads `n` and `m` from input. In our example, `n` and `m` are 9.
2. `field = [input() for _ in range(n)]`: This line reads the field. In our example, the field is already defined.
3. `rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))`: This calculates the number of unique rows considering every third row. In our example, it would be `len(set(''.join(field[i::3]) for i in range(3)))`, resulting in 3 unique rows.
4. `cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for i in range(3))`: This calculates the number of unique columns considering every third column. In our example, it would be `len(set(''.join(row[i * 3:(i + 1) * 3] for row in field)) for i in range(3))`, resulting in 3 unique columns.
5. `print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')`: This checks if the number of unique rows and columns is exactly 3 and prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given our example field, the output will be 'YES' because both `rows` and `cols` are 3.

Output State: **n is 9, m is 9, field is ['RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB', 'RGBRGBRGB'], rows is 3, cols is 3**
