Functionality: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a field, where both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). The field is represented as a list of `n` strings, each consisting of `m` characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. After processing the input, the function checks if the field can be divided into 3x3 sub-grids such that each sub-grid contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If this condition is met for both rows and columns, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

This function does not modify the input field but performs a check based on the given conditions. Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` or `m` is less than 3, the function will not be able to form 3x3 sub-grids, leading to 'NO'.
- If the field cannot be evenly divided into 3x3 sub-grids (e.g., `n` or `m` is not divisible by 3), the function will also print 'NO'.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the console will display either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described above.
