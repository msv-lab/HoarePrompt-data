The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function does not directly return a value based on the parameters but instead seems to be working with a field represented as a list of `n` strings, where each string consists of `m` characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. However, since no specific return conditions are provided in the given output, we can only describe the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where both are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and returns nothing (or its behavior with respect to the field is not specified).**
