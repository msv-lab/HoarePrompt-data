Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the range and variables used in the loop. Here, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for x in range(n):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `valid_ways` is either 0 or 1.
   - `left_product` is `cards[x]`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `x` remains 0.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - The loop variable `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. Since `x` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`x < n`) must still hold true. Since `n` remains greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `x` is still within the range of `range(n)`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `valid_ways` remains either 0 or 1 (no change).
   - `left_product` will now be `cards[1]` because `x` is incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (no change).
   - `x` becomes 1 (since it was incremented by 1).

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`valid_ways` is either 0 or 1, `left_product` is `cards[1]`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `x` is 1**.
