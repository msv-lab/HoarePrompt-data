Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n-1] * (cards[n-2])^2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and goes down to `i = 0` (inclusive).
   - On each iteration, `i` decreases by 1.

4. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - This means the loop has just completed its first iteration where `i` was `n - 2`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 from `n - 2` to `n - 3`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - We need to update `i` to `n - 3`.

7. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - `right_product[i]` will be `right_product[n-1] * (cards[n-2])^2` but for the new value of `i`, it will be `right_product[n-1] * (cards[n-3])^2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
**State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n-1] * (cards[n-3])^2**.
