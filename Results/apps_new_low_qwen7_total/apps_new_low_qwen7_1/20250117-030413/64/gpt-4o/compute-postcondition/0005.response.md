Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `total_product`: The product of all elements in the list `cards`.
- `n`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `k`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- `cards`: A list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq \text{cards}[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `right_product`: A list of length `n + 1` where each element is initially 1.
- `total_product` is divisible by `k`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Range of the For Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `n - 1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over the indices in reverse order, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - In the first iteration, the loop will run when `i` equals `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to check the initial state of the loop when `i = n - 1`.

3. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop itself uses the variable `i` and implicitly uses the variable `n` (the upper bound of the range).

4. **Conditions for the First Execution**:
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse, the first execution of the loop will happen when `i` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - There are no explicit conditions within the loop body provided, but the loop must still initialize properly to start.

5. **State of Variables at the Start of the First Iteration**:
   - `i` should be `n - 1` for the loop to start its first iteration.
   - `n` should be a positive integer as defined.
   - No specific conditions are needed for `total_product`, `k`, or `right_product` to start the first iteration, since they don't directly affect the loop's ability to start.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `i` must be `n - 1`.
- `n` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).

Thus, the required state is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000**.
