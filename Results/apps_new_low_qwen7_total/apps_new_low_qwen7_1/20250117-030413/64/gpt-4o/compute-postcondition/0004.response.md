The code initializes a list `right_product` with length `n + 1`, where each element is set to 1. This does not change the values of `total_product`, `n`, `k`, or the contents of the `cards` list. The precondition that `total_product` is divisible by `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total_product` is the product of all elements in the list `cards`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= cards[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, and `right_product` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1. Furthermore, `total_product` is divisible by `k`.**
