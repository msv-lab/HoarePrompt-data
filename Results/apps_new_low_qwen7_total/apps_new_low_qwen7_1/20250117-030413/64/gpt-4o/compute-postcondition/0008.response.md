The initial state is: `i` is `n - 2`, `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]`.

The code snippet updates `right_product[i]` to `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, so `i + 1` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `right_product[i]` becomes `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]` (the initial value) multiplied by `cards[n-2]`.

So, the updated value of `right_product[i]` is:

\[ \text{right\_product[i]} = (\text{right\_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]}) \times \text{cards[n-2]} = \text{right\_product[n-1] * (cards[n-2])}^2 \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n-1] * (cards[n-2])^2`**
