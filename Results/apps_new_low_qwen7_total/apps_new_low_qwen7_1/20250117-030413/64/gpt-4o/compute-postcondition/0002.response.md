Functionality: **The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. There are no input validations provided in the code for ensuring that `arr` is indeed a list or that its elements are integers. The function uses the `reduce` function to compute the product of all elements in the list, starting with an initial value of 1. The return postcondition is that the function returns the product of all integers in the list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a product of 1, and a list containing only one element, which would return that single element itself.**
