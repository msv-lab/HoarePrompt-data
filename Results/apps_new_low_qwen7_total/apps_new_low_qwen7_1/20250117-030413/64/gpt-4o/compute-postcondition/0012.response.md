Let's analyze the provided code block step by step, starting from the initial state and applying the effects of each line.

### Initial State
- `total_product`: The product of all elements in the `cards` list.
- `n`: Length of the `cards` list.
- `k`: A positive integer.
- `cards`: A list of `n` positive integers.
- `right_product`: A list of length `n + 1` initialized to 1.
- `i`: Not explicitly defined initially.
- `valid_ways`: Not explicitly defined initially.
- `left_product`: Not explicitly defined initially.

### Code Block
```python
valid_ways = 0
left_product = 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Line 1: `valid_ways = 0`**
   - This line initializes the variable `valid_ways` to 0.
   - The initial state of `valid_ways` is undefined (not specified), so it is set to 0.
   
2. **Line 2: `left_product = 1`**
   - This line initializes the variable `left_product` to 1.
   - The initial state of `left_product` is undefined (not specified), so it is set to 1.

### Final Output State
After executing both lines of code, the following variables are updated:
- `valid_ways` is set to 0.
- `left_product` is set to 1.

All other variables remain in their initial or unspecified states, which we do not need to update unless explicitly stated.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **valid_ways is 0, left_product is 1**
