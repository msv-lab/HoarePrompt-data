`left_product` is updated by multiplying it with `cards[x]`. The original value of `left_product` is `cards[1] * cards[1]`, and it will now become `cards[1] * cards[1] * cards[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`valid_ways` is either 0, 1, or 2; `left_product` is `cards[1] * cards[1] * cards[x]`; `n` is greater than 0; and `x` is 3. If `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`, then `valid_ways` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `valid_ways` remains unchanged.**
