The code assigns the value of `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]` to `right_product[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i + 1` would be `n`. Since `right_product` and `cards` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume they are lists or arrays with appropriate lengths.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000

After executing the line of code, `i` remains unchanged, but `right_product[i]` is updated to `right_product[n] * cards[n - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n] * cards[n - 1]`**
