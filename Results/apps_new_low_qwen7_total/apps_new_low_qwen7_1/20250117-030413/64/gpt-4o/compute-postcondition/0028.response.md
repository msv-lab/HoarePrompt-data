The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9.
- `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= cards[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.

After executing the function body, there are two possible cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns a valid_ways which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `cards`, and return either 0 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`.
