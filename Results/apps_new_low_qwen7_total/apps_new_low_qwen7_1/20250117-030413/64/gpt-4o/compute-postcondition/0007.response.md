Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n] * cards[n - 1]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - The value of `right_product[i]` will be `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]` because the loop body would have updated `right_product[i]` to reflect the product calculation.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The variable `i` will be decremented to `n - 2`.
   - The value of `right_product[i]` will be updated to `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2]`**
