Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem. The key steps of the solution are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and processes it to extract the necessary parameters.
2. **Checking Total Product**: The program checks if the product of all numbers in the deck is divisible by `k`.
3. **Calculating Right Product**: The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements from the end of the list to the beginning.
4. **Counting Valid Ways**: The program iterates through the list to count the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that the product of the remaining elements is divisible by `k`.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

- **Step 1: Reading Input**
  - This step is handled correctly by reading all input and splitting it to extract `n`, `k`, and the list of card values.

- **Step 2: Checking Total Product**
  - The function `func_1` checks if the total product of all card values is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0, which is correct.

- **Step 3: Calculating Right Product**
  - The `right_product` list is initialized to 1 and updated in reverse order to store the cumulative product of the elements in `cards` from the end to the beginning.
  - This ensures that `right_product[i]` gives the product of elements from `i` to `n-1`.

- **Step 4: Counting Valid Ways**
  - The program then iterates through the list to check for valid `(x, y)` pairs.
  - For each `x`, it checks if `left_product * right_product[x + 1]` is divisible by `k`. If so, it increments the count of valid ways.

Given these steps, the logic in the provided code correctly implements the required functionality. It checks the divisibility condition and counts the valid pairs accurately.

# Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
