Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose \( x \) and \( y \) such that the product of the remaining cards in the deck is divisible by \( k \). Let's analyze the code and its components to determine if it meets the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It:
   - Computes the total product of all cards.
   - Checks if the total product is divisible by \( k \).
   - If not, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the product of the right part of the deck and checks for valid splits using the left and right products.

2. **Function `lcm`**: This function is not used in the program and does not seem relevant to solving the problem. It incorrectly attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list and an integer, but it does not impact the functionality of `func_1`.

3. **Function `product`**: This function computes the product of elements in a list, which is used within `func_1` to calculate the total product and right products. It works correctly for the intended purpose.

Given that `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid ways to split the deck such that the product is divisible by \( k \), and the other functions do not interfere with this core logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
