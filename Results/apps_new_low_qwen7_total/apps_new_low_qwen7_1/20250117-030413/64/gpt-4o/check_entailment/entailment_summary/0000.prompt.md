 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

# Functions with Execution Summary:

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
cards = list(map(int, data[2:]))
print(func_1(n, k, cards))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ cards[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

The function calculates the product of all elements in the `cards` list and checks if this product is divisible by `k`. If the product is not divisible by `k`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate two products, `left_product` and `right_product`, in two separate loops.

- The `right_product` list is initialized to 1 and is updated in reverse order to store the cumulative product of the elements in `cards` from the end to the beginning.
- The `left_product` is calculated as the product of elements from the start to the current index in the `cards` list.

For each index `x` in the `cards` list, the function checks if the product of `left_product` and `right_product[x + 1]` is divisible by `k`. If true, it increments `valid_ways` by 1. Finally, the function returns `valid_ways`, which represents the number of ways to split the `cards` list into two non-empty contiguous subarrays such that the product of the subarrays is divisible by `k`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function will return 0 because there are no ways to split a single-element list into two non-empty subarrays.
- If `k` is greater than the product of all elements in `cards`, the function will still initialize `right_product` and then proceed to the second loop, but since `left_product` will always be less than `k` (as it multiplies elements from the start), `valid_ways` will remain 0.
- If the product of all elements in `cards` is not divisible by `k`, the function will immediately return 0 without entering the main loop.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `lcm` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `n` integers (where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for each `i`), and `b`, an integer (where `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`). It returns the result of multiplying the sum of all elements in list `a` by `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sum of the elements in list `a` and `b`. 

After the function concludes, the program will have computed and returned this value. However, the provided code only includes the calculation for the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, not the entire list `a` and the integer `b`. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement its described behavior. Instead, it calculates the LCM of the last element of list `a` and the integer `b`.

Potential edge cases include when the GCD of the sum of `a` and `b` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `a` is an empty list, which would lead to undefined behavior since the sum of an empty list is zero.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. There are no input validations provided in the code for ensuring that `arr` is indeed a list or that its elements are integers. The function uses the `reduce` function to compute the product of all elements in the list, starting with an initial value of 1. The return postcondition is that the function returns the product of all integers in the list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a product of 1, and a list containing only one element, which would return that single element itself.
