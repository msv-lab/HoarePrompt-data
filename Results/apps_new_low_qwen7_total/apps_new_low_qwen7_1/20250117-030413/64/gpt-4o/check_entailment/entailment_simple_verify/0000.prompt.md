You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #The loop iterates over the list `cards` in reverse order, updating the `right_product` list. The initial state includes:
    #- `total_product`: The product of all elements in the `cards` list.
    #- `n`: Length of the `cards` list.
    #- `k`: A positive integer.
    #- `cards`: A list of `n` positive integers.
    #- `right_product`: A list of length `n + 1` initialized to 1.
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #The loop updates the `right_product` list as follows:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    #    right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    #```
    #
    #- `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
    #- `right_product[i]` is updated based on the previous value `right_product[i + 1]` and the current element `cards[i]`.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #The loop will execute exactly `n` times because it runs from `n-1` down to `0`. Each iteration updates one element in the `right_product` list based on the corresponding element in the `cards` list.
    #
    #After the loop completes, the `right_product` list will contain:
    #- `right_product[0]` through `right_product[n]` will hold the cumulative product of the `cards` elements from the end to the beginning.
    #- Specifically, `right_product[i]` will be the product of all elements in `cards` from `i` to the end of the list.
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #To verify, let's look at the relationship between the indices and the values in the `right_product` list:
    #- After the loop, `right_product[0]` will be the product of all elements in `cards`.
    #- For any `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `right_product[i]` will be the product of all elements from `i` to `n`.
    #
    #Given the provided output states:
    #- After 1 time: `i` is `n - 1`; `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n] * cards[n - 1]`.
    #- After 2 times: `i` is `n - 2`; `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n - 1] * (cards[n - 2])^2`.
    #- After 3 times: `i` is `n - 3`; `right_product[i]` is `right_product[n - 2] * cards[n - 3]`.
    #
    #This pattern confirms that the loop correctly updates the `right_product` list as intended.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #After the loop has executed `n` times, the final values of the variables are:
    #- `i` will be `-1` (after the last iteration).
    #- `right_product` will be a list of length `n + 1` where:
    #  - `right_product[0]` is the product of all elements in `cards`.
    #  - For `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements from `i` to `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is `-1`; `right_product[0]` is `total_product` and for `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `right_product[i]` is the product of all elements from `i` to `n`.

        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        
        left_product *= cards[x]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: valid_ways is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, left_product is the product of all `cards[x]` for x in the range of the loop, `n` is 0, and `x` is the last value it took in the loop (which is n - 1).
    return valid_ways
    #`The program returns valid_ways which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i.
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of multiplying list 'a' by 'b' divided by the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and 'b' is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9)

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, n is a positive integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr), and k is a positive integer.
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
    #The program returns the product of all integers in list 'arr'




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the product of the entire deck is divisible by `k`. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where removing cards from the top and bottom can still result in a valid deck. Specifically, the program does not properly calculate the product of the sub-deck after removing `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5 6
2 3 4 6 9
```
- The total product of the deck is `2 * 3 * 4 * 6 * 9 = 1296`.
- Since `1296 % 6 == 0`, the initial check passes.
- However, we need to check all possible combinations of `x` and `y` to ensure the sub-deck is valid.

The program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of `x` and `y` to ensure that the product of the sub-deck is divisible by `k`. It only checks the product starting from the first card and moving forward, which does not cover all possible sub-decks formed by removing cards from both ends.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of `x` and `y` and calculate the product of the sub-deck for each combination, checking if it is divisible by `k`.
