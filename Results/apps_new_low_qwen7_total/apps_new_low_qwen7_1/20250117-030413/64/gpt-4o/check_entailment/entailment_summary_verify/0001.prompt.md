You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways

#Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `product` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. There are no input validations provided in the code for ensuring that `arr` is indeed a list or that its elements are integers. The function uses the `reduce` function to compute the product of all elements in the list, starting with an initial value of 1. The return postcondition is that the function returns the product of all integers in the list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a product of 1, and a list containing only one element, which would return that single element itself.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and steps involved in solving the problem.

1. **Total Product Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the total product of all card values (`total_product`), and checks if it is divisible by `k`. If not, no way can be valid, so it returns 0. This step is correct.

2. **Right Product Calculation**:
   - A list `right_product` is initialized with 1s. It then iterates over the cards from the end to the beginning, updating the product of the suffixes. This is correct because it ensures that `right_product[i]` contains the product of all elements from index `i+1` to `n-1`.

3. **Left Product and Valid Ways Calculation**:
   - `left_product` is initialized to 1. The program then iterates through each possible value of `x` (number of cards removed from the top), calculating the product of the prefix up to `x`. For each `x`, it checks if the product of the prefix and the suffix (from `x+1` to `n-y-1`) is divisible by `k`. If so, it increments the count of valid ways.
   - The loop correctly handles all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `lcm` and `product` are defined, but they are not used in the main logic of the solution. However, since they are not used, their correctness does not affect the overall solution.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the number of valid ways to choose `x` and `y` such that the remaining deck is valid.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
