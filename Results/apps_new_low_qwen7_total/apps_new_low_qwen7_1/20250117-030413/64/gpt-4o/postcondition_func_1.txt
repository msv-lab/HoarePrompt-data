The function `lcm` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `n` integers (where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for each `i`), and `b`, an integer (where `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`). It returns the result of multiplying the sum of all elements in list `a` by `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sum of the elements in list `a` and `b`. 

After the function concludes, the program will have computed and returned this value. However, the provided code only includes the calculation for the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, not the entire list `a` and the integer `b`. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement its described behavior. Instead, it calculates the LCM of the last element of list `a` and the integer `b`.

Potential edge cases include when the GCD of the sum of `a` and `b` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `a` is an empty list, which would lead to undefined behavior since the sum of an empty list is zero.
