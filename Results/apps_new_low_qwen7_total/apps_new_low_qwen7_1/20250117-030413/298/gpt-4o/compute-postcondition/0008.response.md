Output State: **n is updated based on the input, m is updated based on the input, k is updated based on the input, area is an integer and remains the same as before the execution of the code, no new variables are defined, print statements execute without affecting variables**

Explanation: The provided code consists of two print statements that do not modify any variables. The print statements simply output 'YES' and '0 0' to the console. Since the code does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`, these variables retain their initial states. No new variables are defined within the code block. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the additional information that the print statements have executed.
