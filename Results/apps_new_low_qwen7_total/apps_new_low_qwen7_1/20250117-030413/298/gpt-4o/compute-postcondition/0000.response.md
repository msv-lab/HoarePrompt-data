The initial state is that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). The code snippet reads three space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Then, it calculates the area as `n * m / k` and stores the result in the variable `area`.

Since the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are provided via input, we cannot specify exact numerical values without knowing the input. However, we can describe the final state based on the operations performed.

After executing the code, the following will be true:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated to the integers read from input.
- A new variable `area` will be created, containing the value of `n * m / k`.

Thus, the output state will include the new values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area`.

Output State: **n, m, k, and area are updated based on the input where area = n * m / k**
