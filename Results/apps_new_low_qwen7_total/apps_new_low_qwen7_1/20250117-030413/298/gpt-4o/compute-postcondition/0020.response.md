The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. The output provided describes different cases based on the relationships between the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, but since these variables are not part of the function's parameters, we need to clarify that the function itself does not take any inputs and thus its functionality cannot be described in terms of accepting parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value based on the given constraints and output descriptions.**
