The provided code consists of two print statements. Let's analyze each line:

1. `print(f'{n} {m // 2}')`: This line prints the value of `n` followed by half of the value of `m` (integer division). The value of `m // 2` will be an integer.

2. `print(f'0 {m // 2}')`: This line prints `0` followed by half of the value of `m` (integer division).

These print statements do not modify any variables; they only output values. The initial conditions and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variables `area` and `k` are not used or modified within this code block, so their values also remain as they were in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is updated based on the input
- `m` is updated based on the input
- `k` is updated based on the input
- `area` is an integer and remains the same as before the execution of the code
- No new variables are defined
- Print statements execute without affecting variables

And the conditions:
- `2 * area > n` holds true
- `2 * area > m`

After executing the code block, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain the same as they were initially. However, the print statements will display the values of `n`, `m // 2`, and `0` respectively.

Output State: **n is updated based on the input, m is updated based on the input, k is updated based on the input, area is an integer and remains the same as before the execution of the code, no new variables are defined, print statements execute without affecting variables**
