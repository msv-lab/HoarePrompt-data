Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. `area` remains the same as before the execution of the code. If `2 * area <= n`, the print statements execute with outputs '1 2*area' and '1 0'. Otherwise, if `2 * area <= m`, then two print statements execute with outputs '1 2*area' and '1 0'. No other print statements are executed under any other conditions.***
