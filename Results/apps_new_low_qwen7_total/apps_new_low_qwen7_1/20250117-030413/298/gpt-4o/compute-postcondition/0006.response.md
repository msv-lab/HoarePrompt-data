The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is updated based on the input, `m` is updated based on the input, `k` is updated based on the input, `area` is an integer and its value remains the same as before the execution of the code, and the console prints 'NO'**
