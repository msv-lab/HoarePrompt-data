The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console but does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input where area = n * m / k, the current value of `area` is not an integer, print('NO') has been executed**
