Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. `area` remains the same as before the execution of the code. If `area == 0`, the console prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `2 * area <= n`, the console prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. If `2 * area <= m` and `2 * area > n`, the console prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. No other print statements are executed under any other conditions.***
