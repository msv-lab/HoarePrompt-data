Functionality: **The function reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). It calculates the area as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO". If the area is zero, it also prints "NO". If the area is an integer, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \). If either condition is true, it prints specific pairs of integers. If neither condition is true, it prints "1 0". The function does not return any value and only prints the results to standard output.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), the function prints "1 2*area" and "1 0".
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) but \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), the function prints "1 2*area" and "1 0".
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \), the function prints "1 2*area" and "1 0".
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \), the function prints "1 0".

Missing Functionality:
- The code provided includes redundant comments and some of the annotations are not accurate. For example, the annotations suggest that `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated, but the actual code does not update these values. Additionally, the annotations suggest that `area` remains the same, which is correct, but this is already implied by the code. The function also prints "0 0", "0 1", "1 0", and "0 {m // 2}" at the end, which are not relevant to the main logic and can be ignored.

Final State of the Program:
- After the function concludes, the program will have printed one or more lines depending on the conditions met during the execution. The specific lines printed will depend on whether the area is an integer, its value, and the comparisons with \( n \) and \( m \).
