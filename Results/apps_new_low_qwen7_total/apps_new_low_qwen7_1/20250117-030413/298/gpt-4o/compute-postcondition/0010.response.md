The provided code consists of two print statements. Let's analyze their impact on the variables and the overall state:

1. The first line `print(f'{2 * area} 1')` prints the value of `2 * area` followed by `1`. Since `area` is an integer and the condition `2 * area <= n` is satisfied, this line will print a value that is twice the original value of `area`, followed by `1`.

2. The second line `print(f'0 1')` prints `0` followed by `1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is updated based on the input
- `m` is updated based on the input
- `k` is updated based on the input
- `area` is an integer and remains the same as before the execution of the code
- No new variables are defined
- The print statements execute without affecting variables

No variables are actually modified by these print statements; they merely output text. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **n is updated based on the input, m is updated based on the input, k is updated based on the input, area is an integer and remains the same as before the execution of the code, the print statements execute without affecting variables**
