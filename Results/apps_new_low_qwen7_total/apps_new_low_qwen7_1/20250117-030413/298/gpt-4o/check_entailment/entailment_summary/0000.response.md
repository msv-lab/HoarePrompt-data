Reasoning:

1. **Area Calculation and Validation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the required area as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - It checks if this area is an integer and prints "NO" if it is not. This step is correct.
   
2. **Handling Zero Area**:
   - If the calculated area is zero, the program prints "NO". This is also correct because a triangle with zero area cannot exist.
   
3. **Generating Points for Non-Zero Area**:
   - If the area is an integer, the program proceeds to generate points.
   - It checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it prints \( (0, 0) \), \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \), and \( (0, 1) \). This forms a triangle with the correct area.
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it prints \( (1, 0) \), \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \), and \( (0, 0) \). This also forms a triangle with the correct area.
     - If neither condition is met, it prints \( (n, m // 2) \), \( (0, m // 2) \), and \( (0, 0) \). This forms a triangle with the correct area.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when \( n \) or \( m \) is very large but the area is still small enough to form a valid triangle.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "YES" before printing the coordinates, which follows the specified format.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
