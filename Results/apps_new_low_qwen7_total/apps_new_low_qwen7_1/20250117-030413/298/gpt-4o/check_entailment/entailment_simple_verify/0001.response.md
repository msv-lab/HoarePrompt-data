### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the triangle is calculated as `area = n * m / k`.
   - The program checks if this area is an integer by comparing `area` with `int(area)`. If not, it prints "NO", which is correct because non-integer areas mean no integer points can form a triangle with that exact area.

3. **Special Case for Area 0:**
   - If the area is 0, the program prints "NO". This is correct because a triangle with zero area does not exist unless all points are collinear, which isn't the intended scenario.

4. **General Case for Non-Zero Area:**
   - If the area is an integer, the program prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)` that satisfy the conditions.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the approach taken to determine the points:
     - The current logic assumes that setting `(x2, y2)` and `(x3, y3)` to specific values will always result in a triangle with the desired area.
     - Specifically, the program tries to set `(x2, y2)` and `(x3, y3)` to `(2 * area, 1)`, `(1, 2 * area)`, or `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`, but it does not ensure that these points actually form a triangle with the desired area.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example where `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 3`. The area is `4 * 3 / 3 = 4`.
   - According to the program, it prints "YES" and sets `(x2, y2) = (4, 1)` and `(x3, y3) = (0, 1)`.
   - However, these points do not form a triangle with area 4. The area of the triangle formed by `(0, 0)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` is actually 2, not 4.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The current logic fails to properly generate points that satisfy the area condition. For instance, when `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, the chosen points may not form the correct area.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It incorrectly sets the points without ensuring they form the desired area.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
