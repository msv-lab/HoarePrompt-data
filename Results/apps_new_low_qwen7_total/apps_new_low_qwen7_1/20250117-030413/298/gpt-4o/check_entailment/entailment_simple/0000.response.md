Reasoning:

1. **Area Calculation and Validity Check**: 
   - The program correctly calculates the required area for the triangle as \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \).
   - It checks if this area is an integer. If not, it immediately prints "NO", which is correct.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - When the calculated area is zero, the program correctly prints "NO". This handles the case where \( nm \) is not divisible by \( k \).

3. **Triangle Construction**:
   - For non-zero areas, the program attempts to construct a triangle with vertices at specific points. However, the logic for constructing the triangle is flawed.
   - Specifically, the current logic tries to place the points in a way that might not always result in a valid triangle with the required area. For example, placing points at \((2*area, 1)\), \((1, 2*area)\), etc., does not guarantee that these points form a triangle with the specified area.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the provided examples, the solution works for the given test cases because they happen to fit the pattern. However, this does not mean the general logic is correct.
   - For instance, in the second example (input: `4 4 7`), the area would be \( \frac{16}{7} \), which is not an integer, so it correctly prints "NO".
   - In the first example (input: `4 3 3`), the area is 4, which is an integer. The solution constructs a triangle with area 4, but the logic to determine the points is incorrect.

5. **General Case**:
   - The general logic to construct the points is insufficient and may fail for many cases. For example, if \( n \) and \( m \) are both even and \( k \) divides \( nm \) but not both \( n \) and \( m \), the current method will not work.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to provide a general and correct method to construct the required points for all valid cases. The current logic only works for specific edge cases and not in a general sense. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
