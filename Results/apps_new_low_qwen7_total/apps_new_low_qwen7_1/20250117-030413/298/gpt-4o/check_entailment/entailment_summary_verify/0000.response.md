### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Area Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the area as \(\frac{nm}{k}\) and checks if it is an integer.
2. **Zero Area Check**: The program handles the special case where the area is zero by printing "NO".
3. **Triangle Area Check**: The program then checks if the area is greater than zero and tries to find three points to form a triangle with the required area.

#### Analysis of the Given Examples and Constraints:
1. **Example 1**: \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), \(k = 3\)
   - Area: \(\frac{4 \times 3}{3} = 4\), which is an integer.
   - The program correctly finds points \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), \((4, 1)\) which form a triangle with area 4.
   
2. **Example 2**: \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 7\)
   - Area: \(\frac{4 \times 4}{7} = \frac{16}{7}\), which is not an integer.
   - The program correctly prints "NO".
   
3. **Example 3**: \(n = 6\), \(m = 7\), \(k = 2\)
   - Area: \(\frac{6 \times 7}{2} = 21\), which is an integer.
   - The program should find points to form a triangle with area 21. The current implementation attempts to place points in specific regions, but it may not cover all configurations.

The original assessment claimed that the program fails to handle the case when \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\). However, let's analyze the current implementation more closely:

- The program checks if \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\) or \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\).
- If either condition is true, it places points accordingly.
- If neither condition is true, it defaults to printing "1 0", which is incorrect.

However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for the case where both conditions fail simultaneously. Instead, it uses a default fallback, which might not always produce a valid solution.

To address this, we need to ensure the program covers all possible configurations of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).

#### Improved Implementation:
We can modify the program to ensure all cases are handled properly. Here's an improved version:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m // k
    if area * k != n * m:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        # Determine points based on the area
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                # Handle the case where both 2*area > n and 2*area > m
                x1, y1 = 0, 0
                x2, y2 = n - 1, 0
                x3, y3 = 0, m - 1
                if (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) == 2 * area:
                    print(f'{x2} {y2}')
                    print(f'{x3} {y3}')
                else:
                    print('NO')

func()
```

This modified version ensures that all configurations are checked and handles the case where both \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\).

### Final Evaluation:

Given the improved implementation, the original assessment is accurate because the program did not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
