You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). It calculates the area as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO". If the area is zero, it also prints "NO". If the area is an integer, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \). If either condition is true, it prints specific pairs of integers. If neither condition is true, it prints "1 0". The function does not return any value and only prints the results to standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\) simultaneously, which can occur for certain values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). For example, consider the input \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 5\):

- Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{3 \times 3}{5} = \frac{9}{5}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- However, for \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 4\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4} = \frac{9}{4}\), which is also not an integer, so the program again correctly outputs "NO".
- But for \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 3\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{4 \times 4}{3} = \frac{16}{3}\), which is not an integer, so the program again correctly outputs "NO".
- Now consider \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 5\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{4 \times 4}{5} = \frac{16}{5}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- However, for \(n = 6\), \(m = 6\), and \(k = 7\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{6 \times 6}{7} = \frac{36}{7}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- But for \(n = 6\), \(m = 7\), and \(k = 2\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{6 \times 7}{2} = 21\), which is an integer.
  - The program should find three points such that the area of the triangle is 21, but it does not handle this case correctly. Specifically, the logic to determine the coordinates does not cover all possible configurations, leading to an incorrect output.

Since the program fails to handle all potential cases, particularly when both \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), the correctness is False.
