Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\) simultaneously, which can occur for certain values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). For example, consider the input \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 5\):

- Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{3 \times 3}{5} = \frac{9}{5}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- However, for \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 4\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4} = \frac{9}{4}\), which is also not an integer, so the program again correctly outputs "NO".
- But for \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 3\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{4 \times 4}{3} = \frac{16}{3}\), which is not an integer, so the program again correctly outputs "NO".
- Now consider \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 5\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{4 \times 4}{5} = \frac{16}{5}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- However, for \(n = 6\), \(m = 6\), and \(k = 7\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{6 \times 6}{7} = \frac{36}{7}\), which is not an integer, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
- But for \(n = 6\), \(m = 7\), and \(k = 2\):
  - Area calculation: \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{6 \times 7}{2} = 21\), which is an integer.
  - The program should find three points such that the area of the triangle is 21, but it does not handle this case correctly. Specifically, the logic to determine the coordinates does not cover all possible configurations, leading to an incorrect output.

Since the program fails to handle all potential cases, particularly when both \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), the correctness is False.
