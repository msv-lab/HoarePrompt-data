Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input.
2. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \) and checks if it is an integer. This is correct.
3. **No Area Condition**: If the calculated area is not an integer, the program correctly prints "NO".
4. **Zero Area Condition**: If the area is zero, the program correctly prints "NO".
5. **Non-zero Integer Area Handling**:
   - The program checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it prints "YES" and outputs points \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \), it prints "YES" and outputs points \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\) and \((1, 0)\).
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "YES" and outputs points \((1, 0)\).

However, there is an issue with the logic in the annotated program. Specifically, the conditions for printing the points are incomplete and do not cover all cases properly. Here's a more detailed analysis of the problem and the corrected logic:

1. If the area is not an integer, print "NO".
2. If the area is zero, print "NO".
3. If the area is an integer, check the following:
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), print "YES" and output points \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\).
   - If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), print "YES" and output points \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\) and \((1, 0)\).
   - If neither condition is met, print "YES" and output points \((1, 0)\).

Given this detailed analysis, the provided implementation does not cover all necessary conditions properly, which could lead to incorrect outputs for some valid cases.

Correctness: **False**
