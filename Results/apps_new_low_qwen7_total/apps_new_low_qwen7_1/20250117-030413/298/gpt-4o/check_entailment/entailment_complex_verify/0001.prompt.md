You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')

area = n * m / k

                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. `area` remains the same as before the execution of the code. If `2 * area <= m`, then two print statements execute with outputs '1 2*area' and '1 0'. Otherwise, no additional print statements are executed with different outputs.

If `2 * area <= n`, the print statements execute with outputs '1 2*area' and '1 0'. Otherwise, if `2 * area <= m`, then two print statements execute with outputs '1 2*area' and '1 0'. No other print statements are executed under any other conditions.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. `area` remains the same as before the execution of the code. If `area == 0`, the console prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `2 * area <= n`, the console prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. If `2 * area <= m` and `2 * area > n`, the console prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. No other print statements are executed under any other conditions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input where `area = n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `area == 0`, the function prints 'NO'. If `2 * area <= n`, the function prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. If `2 * area <= m` and `2 * area > n`, the function prints '1 2*area' and '1 0'. No other print statements are executed under any other conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). It calculates the area as \( \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO". If the area is zero, it also prints "NO". If the area is an integer, it checks if \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \) or \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \). If either condition is true, it prints specific pairs of integers. If neither condition is true, it prints "1 0". The function does not return any value and only prints the results to standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the triangle is calculated as `area = n * m / k`.
   - The program checks if this area is an integer by comparing `area` with `int(area)`. If not, it prints "NO", which is correct because non-integer areas mean no integer points can form a triangle with that exact area.

3. **Special Case for Area 0:**
   - If the area is 0, the program prints "NO". This is correct because a triangle with zero area does not exist unless all points are collinear, which isn't the intended scenario.

4. **General Case for Non-Zero Area:**
   - If the area is an integer, the program prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)` that satisfy the conditions.
   - It checks if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m` and selects appropriate coordinates accordingly.
     - If `2 * area <= n`, it sets `(x2, y2) = (2 * area, 1)` and `(x3, y3) = (0, 1)`.
     - If `2 * area <= m`, it sets `(x2, y2) = (1, 2 * area)` and `(x3, y3) = (1, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `(x2, y2) = (n, m // 2)` and `(x3, y3) = (0, m // 2)`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m` by choosing points along the boundaries of the grid, ensuring they still form a triangle with the required area.

Given these steps, the logic of the program appears sound and should correctly handle the given constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem, considering all specified conditions and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
