The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function `func_3` returns these two values `x` and `y` along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that the values `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions to form a triangle with a specific area. If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values, the function will still return `x` and `y` as `None` or handle the error internally, although the exact handling is not specified in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns three values: the first and second return values from `func_2(a, b)`, and their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.
