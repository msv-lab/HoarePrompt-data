This function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, both `a` and `b` are set to the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD.
