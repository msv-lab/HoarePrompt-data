Functionality: **This function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, both `a` and `b` are set to the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a` and `b` are equal initially, the function will still compute the GCD, which is `a` (or `b`). In this case, the loop will execute once, setting `a` and `b` to their GCD.
- If `a` is not greater than `b`, the function will not operate correctly as intended because the condition `a > b` is required for the loop to proceed. This is an invalid input scenario, and the function assumes `a > b` is always true, so no additional handling is needed for this case within the function itself.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no missing functionalities in the given code. The code accurately implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD and handles the specified edge case where `a` and `b` are equal.
