The code `x, y = func_2(a, b)` assigns the return values of the function `func_2(a, b)` to the variables `x` and `y`. Since the function `func_2(a, b)` is not defined in this context, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`, but we know they are returned from `func_2(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the second return value of `func_2(a, b)`**
