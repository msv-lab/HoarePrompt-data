The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers representing `n` and `m` respectively, such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). Additionally, `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\), although `k` is not directly used as a parameter of `func_3`.

After executing the function body, the function returns three values: `x`, `y`, and `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return the values returned by `func_2(a, b)` along with their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, returns the values returned by `func_2(a, b)` along with their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.**
