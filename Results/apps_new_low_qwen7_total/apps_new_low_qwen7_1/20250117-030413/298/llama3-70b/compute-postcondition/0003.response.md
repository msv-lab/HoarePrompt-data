Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function `func_3` returns these two values `x` and `y` along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that the values `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions to form a triangle with a specific area. If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values, the function will still return `x` and `y` as `None` or handle the error internally, although the exact handling is not specified in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns three values: the first and second return values from `func_2(a, b)`, and their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values (e.g., non-positive integers), the function should handle this scenario appropriately. Since the code does not explicitly handle this case, it is assumed that `func_2(a, b)` always returns valid values, but in practice, the function might need to include error handling to manage such scenarios.**

This summary covers the main functionality of the function, includes the expected behavior, and notes the importance of handling potential edge cases.
