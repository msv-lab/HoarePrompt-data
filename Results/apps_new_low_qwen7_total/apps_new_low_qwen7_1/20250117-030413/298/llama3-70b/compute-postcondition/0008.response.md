The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `a` is greater than `b`. After executing the function body, the function returns `a`, which is equal to `b` and both are equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are positive integers and `a` > `b`. It returns `a`, which is equal to `b` and both are equal to the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.**
