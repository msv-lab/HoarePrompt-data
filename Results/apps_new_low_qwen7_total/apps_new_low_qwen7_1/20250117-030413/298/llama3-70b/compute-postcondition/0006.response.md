Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \( b \neq 0 \)). It recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is zero, it directly returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call to itself with `b` and `a % b`, and based on the result of this recursive call, it computes and returns either `(1, 0)` or a pair of integers `(y, x - a // b * y)` which satisfy the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This ensures that the function not only finds the GCD but also provides the coefficients `x` and `y` of BÃ©zout's identity.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a` or `b` is zero, the function should handle these cases. However, the provided code assumes both `a` and `b` are positive integers where \( b \neq 0 \), so no special handling is needed for non-positive inputs or zero values of `b`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not include any explicit checks for non-positive inputs or zero values of `a`. While the current assumptions cover these cases, it would be more robust to add such checks to ensure the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs.
