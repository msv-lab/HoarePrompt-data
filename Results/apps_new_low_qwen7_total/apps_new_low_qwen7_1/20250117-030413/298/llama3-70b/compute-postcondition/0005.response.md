The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers where \( b \neq 0 \). The function returns either 1 and 0 or `y, x - a // b * y` where `x` and `y` are values returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` (with \( b \neq 0 \)), and return either 1 and 0 or `y, x - a // b * y` based on the recursive call to itself with parameters `b` and `a % b`.
