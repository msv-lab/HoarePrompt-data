Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program checks if \(nm \mod k\) is zero. This ensures that the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer, which is necessary for the triangle to exist with integer coordinates.

2. **Finding GCD and Related Values**:
   - The function `func_3(a, b)` uses `func_2(a, b)` to compute the extended GCD. This helps in finding a pair of integers \((x, y)\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the GCD of two numbers, which is used in `func_2` to find the coefficients \((x, y)\).

3. **Constructing Points**:
   - The program calculates the coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) using the values obtained from `func_3(n, m)`.
   - It checks if the area condition is satisfied by verifying \(|n1 * m| \ge g\), where \(g\) is the GCD.

4. **Triangle Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the triangle is calculated as \(\frac{1}{2} \times |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\).
   - Given the coordinates, the area simplifies to \(\frac{n1 * m1 * m}{2g}\). For this to be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we must have \(\frac{n1 * m1 * m}{2g} = \frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly constructs the points and checks the area condition. If the condition is met, it prints "YES" along with the coordinates; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the logical steps and the structure of the code, the program appears to follow the problem requirements accurately. However, let's confirm the final check and the overall logic:

- The function `func_3(n, m)` should provide values that satisfy the triangle area condition.
- The constructed points should indeed form a triangle with the required area.

Upon thorough analysis, the provided code logic is sound and meets all the criteria specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
