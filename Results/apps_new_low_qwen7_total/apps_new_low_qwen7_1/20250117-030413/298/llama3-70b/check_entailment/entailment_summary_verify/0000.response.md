### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program provided does not solve the problem as described. However, let's re-evaluate the role of the functions and see if they could potentially be used to solve the problem.

1. **Understanding the Functions**:
   - `func_1` is the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - `func_2` is the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - `func_3` uses `func_2` to return the coefficients and their linear combination.

2. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The key requirement is to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle formed by points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - We need this area to be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

3. **Using the Functions**:
   - The Extended Euclidean algorithm can help us find integer solutions to equations involving \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, if we can find \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\), we might be able to use similar techniques to find integer points for the triangle.
   - Given the constraints, we can consider setting up the equation \(x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) = 2 \cdot \frac{nm}{k}\).

4. **Potential Solution**:
   - By using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, we can generate integer solutions that might fit the requirement.
   - For example, if we set \(x_1 = n\), \(y_1 = 0\), \(x_2 = 0\), \(y_2 = m\), and \(x_3 = n\), \(y_3 = m\), we can check if the area is correct.

However, the current implementation does not include any logic to generate such points or check the feasibility. The functions provided are not utilized in the main program logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described, even though the helper functions could theoretically be used to generate the required points. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
