### Reasoning:

1. **Revisiting the Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Reviewing the Given Code and Function Summaries:**
   - The code includes three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but none of these functions are used to solve the main problem. Instead, the program only checks if \(k = 2\) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
   - The function `func_3` is intended to solve Bézout's identity, but it is not utilized in the program. The other functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) compute the GCD and use the extended Euclidean algorithm, respectively, but again, they are not used to solve the main problem.

3. **Analyzing the Program Behavior:**
   - The program does not attempt to find any points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) that satisfy the area condition.
   - The check `if k == 2:` is the only part of the program that provides any output, but it only handles the special case where \(k = 2\). For any other value of \(k\), the program prints "NO", even though valid points might exist.

4. **Using the Function Summaries:**
   - The function `func_3` is described as returning values that satisfy Bézout's identity, but it is not called or used in the program. This suggests that the program should not rely on these functions for solving the main problem.
   - The function summaries indicate that `func_3` is supposed to return values that can form a triangle with a specific area, but the program does not use these values to find the points.

5. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\). However, the assessment could have been more precise in explaining why the program fails to use the provided functions correctly.

Given this analysis, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not attempt to find the required points for any value of \(k\), and it only partially handles the special case where \(k = 2\).

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).

### Final:
Final: **False**
