You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function `func_3` returns these two values `x` and `y` along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that the values `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions to form a triangle with a specific area. If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values, the function will still return `x` and `y` as `None` or handle the error internally, although the exact handling is not specified in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns three values: the first and second return values from `func_2(a, b)`, and their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times |x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1|\).

2. **Simplifying the Problem:**
   - For simplicity, we can place two points at \((0, 0)\) and \((n, y)\) and solve for the third point \((x, m)\).
   - The area of the triangle would be \(\frac{1}{2} \times n \times m = \frac{nm}{2}\).
   - We need this area to be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Therefore, \(\frac{nm}{2} = \frac{nm}{k}\) implies \(k = 2\).

3. **Checking the Functions:**
   - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which is not directly needed here.
   - `func_3` computes the solution to Bézout's identity but is also not directly relevant to solving this problem.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not actually attempt to find the required points. It simply checks if \(k = 2\) and prints the result accordingly.
   - For other values of \(k\), the program incorrectly outputs "NO" without attempting to find valid points.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs. Specifically, it only handles the case where \(k = 2\) and does not provide a general solution.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).
