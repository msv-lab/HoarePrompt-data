### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times |x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1|\).

2. **Simplifying the Problem:**
   - For simplicity, we can place two points at \((0, 0)\) and \((n, y)\) and solve for the third point \((x, m)\).
   - The area of the triangle would be \(\frac{1}{2} \times n \times m = \frac{nm}{2}\).
   - We need this area to be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Therefore, \(\frac{nm}{2} = \frac{nm}{k}\) implies \(k = 2\).

3. **Checking the Functions:**
   - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which is not directly needed here.
   - `func_3` computes the solution to Bézout's identity but is also not directly relevant to solving this problem.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not actually attempt to find the required points. It simply checks if \(k = 2\) and prints the result accordingly.
   - For other values of \(k\), the program incorrectly outputs "NO" without attempting to find valid points.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs. Specifically, it only handles the case where \(k = 2\) and does not provide a general solution.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).
