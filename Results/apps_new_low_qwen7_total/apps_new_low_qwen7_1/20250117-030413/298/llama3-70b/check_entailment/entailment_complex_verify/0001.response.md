### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times |x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1|\).

2. **Simplifying the Problem:**
   - To form a triangle with the required area, we need \(\frac{1}{2} \times |x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1| = \frac{nm}{k}\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(|x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1| = \frac{2nm}{k}\).

3. **Analyze the Given Code:**
   - The code first checks if \(n \times m\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it immediately prints "NO".
   - If \(n \times m\) is divisible by \(k\), it proceeds to compute the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_3`, which calls `func_2` and `func_1`.
   - It then checks if the product \(n1 \cdot m1\) is greater than or equal to the GCD `g`. If true, it prints "YES" and the coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \cdot m1 // g)\), and \((m1 \cdot m // g, 0)\).

4. **Evaluate the Correctness:**
   - The logic in the code is flawed. It only considers a specific configuration of points and does not account for all possible configurations.
   - The code incorrectly assumes that placing points at \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \cdot m1 // g)\), and \((m1 \cdot m // g, 0)\) will always form a valid triangle with the required area.
   - The annotated code and the functions provided do not support this assumption. `func_2` and `func_3` are part of the extended Euclidean algorithm and are not directly related to solving the problem at hand.

5. **General Solution:**
   - A correct approach would involve finding integer solutions to the equation \(|x_1 \cdot y_2 - x_2 \cdot y_1| = \frac{2nm}{k}\).
   - One valid solution is to place the points at \((0, 0)\), \((n, \frac{2m}{k})\), and \((\frac{2n}{k}, m)\).

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
