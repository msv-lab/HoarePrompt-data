### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Check:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it prints "NO" and exits immediately. This check is crucial because the area of the triangle must be an integer, which is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function takes \(a\) and \(b\) as inputs, where \(a = n\) and \(b = m\).
   - It calls `func_2(a, b)`, which uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) and also the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - It returns \(x\), \(y\), and \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b\).
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the extended Euclidean algorithm, \(x\) and \(y\) are guaranteed to exist and form a linear combination that equals the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks if \(|n1 \cdot m1| \geq g\). Here, \(n1\) and \(m1\) are the first and second return values from `func_3`, and \(g\) is the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - If the condition holds, it prints "YES" and provides the coordinates of the points:
     - \((0, 0)\)
     - \((0, n1 \cdot m // g)\)
     - \((m1 \cdot m // g, 0)\)
   - These points form a right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes, and their area is \(\frac{nm}{2}\).
   - Since \(\frac{nm}{2}\) must be an integer for the area to match \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need \(k\) to be even or the triangle area to be adjusted accordingly.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If the condition fails, it prints "NO", indicating no valid solution exists under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The use of the GCD and the extended Euclidean algorithm ensures that the points are valid. The main logic checks the feasibility of forming such a triangle and prints the appropriate output.
