### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to understand its behavior and verify the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling and Initial Check**:
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input.
   - It checks if \( nm \mod k \) is zero. If not, it prints "NO" and exits immediately.
   - This check ensures that \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer, which is a necessary condition for the problem to have a solution.

2. **Extended GCD Calculation**:
   - The program calls `func_3(n, m)` which in turn calls `func_2(n, m)`.
   - `func_2(n, m)` computes the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \gcd(n, m) \) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - `func_3(n, m)` then calculates \( x' = x \cdot n + y \cdot m \) and \( y' = y \cdot n + x \cdot m \).

3. **Triangle Area Verification**:
   - The program then checks if the absolute value of \( n1 \times m1 \) is greater than or equal to \( g \) (where \( g = \gcd(n, m) \)).
   - If this condition holds, it prints "YES" and provides coordinates for the points:
     - \((0, 0)\)
     - \((0, n1 \times m1 // g)\)
     - \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\)
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of GCD Calculation**:
  - The GCD calculation is correct and uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm correctly. The values returned by `func_2` and `func_3` are valid.

- **Area Condition Check**:
  - The check `if abs(n1 * m1) >= g:` ensures that the product of the coordinates \( n1 \) and \( m1 \) is at least the GCD, which is a necessary condition for forming a triangle with the required area.

- **Triangle Formation**:
  - The coordinates provided form a right triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \times m1 // g)\), and \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\). The area of this triangle is indeed \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Conclusion:

The annotated code correctly implements the logic to determine if a solution exists and provides the necessary coordinates if the solution is feasible. The program handles all the necessary steps to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
