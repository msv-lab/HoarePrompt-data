### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not handle the general case where \(k \neq 2\). However, let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code to see if there are any hidden functionalities or if the approach might work under certain conditions.

#### Re-evaluating the Code:

1. **Input Parsing and GCD Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It then checks if \(n \times m \mod k \neq 0\). If this condition holds, it prints "NO" and exits, meaning the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) cannot be achieved with integer coordinates, as the area must be an integer.

2. **Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD and related values. These functions are not directly used in the main logic but could potentially be used for further calculations if needed.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calculates \(n1\), \(m1\), and \(g\) using `func_3(n, m)`. Here, \(g\) is the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then checks if \(|n1 \times m| \ge g\). This condition seems unnecessary and might be a mistake since the values are already computed using the GCD.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition \(|n1 \times m| \ge g\) is met, it prints "YES" and provides the coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 \times m // g)\), and \((m1 \times m // g, 0)\).
   - If the condition fails, it prints "NO".

#### Correctness Analysis:

- The main issue is that the program incorrectly assumes that \(g\) (the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\)) will always allow forming a triangle with the required area. This is not necessarily true, especially when \(k \neq 2\).
- The annotated code does not provide a clear path for how the calculated values lead to the desired points. The logic seems incomplete and might be incorrect.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the general case for \(k \neq 2\) correctly.

### Conclusion:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for finding the points when \(k \neq 2\).
