Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not attempt to solve the problem as described. It only includes three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) that do not relate to solving the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. These functions appear to deal with Euclidean algorithms and extended Euclidean algorithms, which are not directly relevant to the problem at hand. 

Since the program does not contain any logic to find the required points or check the feasibility of the problem, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is False.
