 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, both `a` and `b` are set to the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \( b \neq 0 \)). It recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is zero, it directly returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call to itself with `b` and `a % b`, and based on the result of this recursive call, it computes and returns either `(1, 0)` or a pair of integers `(y, x - a // b * y)` which satisfy the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This ensures that the function not only finds the GCD but also provides the coefficients `x` and `y` of Bézout's identity.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function `func_3` returns these two values `x` and `y` along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that the values `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions to form a triangle with a specific area. If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values, the function will still return `x` and `y` as `None` or handle the error internally, although the exact handling is not specified in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns three values: the first and second return values from `func_2(a, b)`, and their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.
