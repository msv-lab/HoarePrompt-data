### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input.
   
2. **Check if Area is an Integer:**
   - The program checks if \(nm \mod k = 0\). If not, it prints "NO" and exits because the area cannot be an integer.
   
3. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The function `func_3(n, m)` uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(nx + my = \gcd(n, m)\).
   - The function `func_2(a, b)` is used to compute the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the equation.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Triangle Points Calculation:**
   - If \(n1 * m \ge g\), the program prints "YES".
   - The points are calculated as follows:
     - Point 1: \((0, 0)\)
     - Point 2: \((0, n1 * m // g)\)
     - Point 3: \((m1 * m // g, 0)\)

5. **Verification:**
   - We need to verify that the area of the triangle formed by these points is indeed \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by \(\frac{1}{2} |x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2|\).
   - For our points, the area is \(\frac{1}{2} |0 \cdot (m1 * m // g) - (m1 * m // g) \cdot 0| = 0\), which is incorrect. Instead, we should use \((0, n1 * m // g)\) and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) directly.

Given the above steps, the current implementation seems to have an issue with the area calculation. Specifically, the points chosen do not correctly form the required triangle area.

### Conclusion:

The provided implementation does not correctly calculate the points to form a triangle with the required area. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
