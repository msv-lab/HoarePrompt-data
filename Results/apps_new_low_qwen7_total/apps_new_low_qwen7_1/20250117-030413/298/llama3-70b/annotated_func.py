#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers, and a > b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns `a` which is equal to `b` and both are equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, both `a` and `b` are set to the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where \( b \neq 0 \).
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`The program returns y, x - a // b * y` where `x` and `y` are values returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \( b \neq 0 \)). It recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is zero, it directly returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call to itself with `b` and `a % b`, and based on the result of this recursive call, it computes and returns either `(1, 0)` or a pair of integers `(y, x - a // b * y)` which satisfy the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This ensures that the function not only finds the GCD but also provides the coefficients `x` and `y` of Bézout's identity.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing n and m respectively, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and k is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function assumes that (x, y) returned by func_2(a, b) satisfies the conditions to form a triangle with the required area.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #`x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is the second return value of `func_2(a, b)`, the program returns `x, y, x * a + y * b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function `func_3` returns these two values `x` and `y` along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function ensures that the values `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions to form a triangle with a specific area. If `func_2(a, b)` does not return valid values, the function will still return `x` and `y` as `None` or handle the error internally, although the exact handling is not specified in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns three values: the first and second return values from `func_2(a, b)`, and their linear combination based on `a` and `b`.
