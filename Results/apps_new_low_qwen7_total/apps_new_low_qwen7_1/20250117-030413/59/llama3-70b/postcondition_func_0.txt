The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\). It calculates the total length as \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\). Depending on whether `total_length` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints either `1` or the result of \(-(-\text{total_length} // n)\). The final state of the program is that it prints either `1` or \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\) based on the condition. The function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it outputs the result directly.
