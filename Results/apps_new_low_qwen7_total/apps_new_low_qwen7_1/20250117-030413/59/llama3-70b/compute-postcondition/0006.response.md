The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to use predefined variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers with specific constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.

Based on the given cases, the function has two possible return values:

- Case_1: If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `True`.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the predefined integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and return `True` if `a` is equal to `b`, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns `True` if `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it returns `False`.**
