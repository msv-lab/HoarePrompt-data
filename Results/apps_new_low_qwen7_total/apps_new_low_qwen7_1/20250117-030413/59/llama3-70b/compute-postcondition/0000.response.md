Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, total_length is 2 * (a * 2 + b)**

Explanation:
- The first line reads an integer input for `n`.
- The second line reads an integer input for `a`.
- The third line reads an integer input for `b`.
- The fourth line calculates `total_length` as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`, which simplifies to `2 * (2a + b)`. This expression is then assigned to `total_length`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on user input, while `total_length` is newly created and initialized based on the given formula.
