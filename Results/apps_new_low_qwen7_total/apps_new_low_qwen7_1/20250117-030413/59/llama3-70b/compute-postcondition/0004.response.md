The code `print(-(-total_length // n))` performs the following operations:

1. It calculates `total_length // n`, which is the integer division of `total_length` by `n`.
2. It applies the double negative `-(-x)` to the result, which effectively returns the same value as `x` but ensures the result is positive if the original division resulted in a negative number due to the floor division.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\)
- `total_length` is \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\)
- `total_length` is greater than `n`

Since `total_length` is defined as \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\), we know that:
\[ \text{total\_length} = 2 \times (2a + b) \]

And since `total_length` is greater than `n`, we have:
\[ 2 \times (2a + b) > n \]

When we perform the integer division of `total_length` by `n`:
\[ \text{total\_length} // n = \left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor \]

The double negative `-(-x)` applied to this result simply returns the same value:
\[ \text{result} = -(-(\text{total\_length} // n)) = \left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor \]

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `total_length` is \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\), and the result is \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\)**.
