Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `total_length` is \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\). If `total_length` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not change `total_length`. Otherwise, `total_length` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\).**
