### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Variable Assignment**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` from standard input and assigns them to variables.

2. **Total Length Calculation**: The total length required to make the frames for two doors is calculated correctly as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. This accounts for the two vertical sides (`2 * a`) and the one horizontal top side (`b`) for each of the two doors.

3. **Integer Division and Ceiling Function**: The expression `-(-total_length // n)` is used to compute the minimal number of wooden bars required. This expression essentially performs an integer division with ceiling, which ensures that if there's any remainder, an additional wooden bar is needed. However, there is a subtle issue in how the ceiling function is applied.

   - The expression `-(-total_length // n)` effectively computes \(\lceil \frac{\text{total\_length}}{n} \rceil\), which is the correct way to determine the minimum number of wooden bars needed when each bar is of length `n`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the minimal number of wooden bars needed.

Let's analyze the examples provided to ensure correctness:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: \( n = 8 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (1 \times 2 + 2) = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
  - Since the total length is exactly 8, only 1 wooden bar is needed.
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 3 \), \( b = 4 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (3 \times 2 + 4) = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
  - Since the total length is 20 and each wooden bar is 5 units long, 4 wooden bars are needed.
  - Using `-(-total_length // n)`:
    \[
    -(-20 // 5) = -(-4) = 4
    \]
  - Output: 4 (Incorrect in the original assessment; should be 4, not 6)

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: \( n = 6 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (4 \times 2 + 2) = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
  - Since the total length is 20 and each wooden bar is 6 units long, 4 wooden bars are needed.
  - Using `-(-total_length // n)`:
    \[
    -(-20 // 6) = -(-3) = 3
    \]
  - Output: 3 (Incorrect in the original assessment; should be 4)

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: \( n = 20 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (5 \times 2 + 6) = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
  - Since the total length is 32 and each wooden bar is 20 units long, 2 wooden bars are needed.
  - Using `-(-total_length // n)`:
    \[
    -(-32 // 20) = -(-1) = 1
    \]
  - Output: 1 (Incorrect in the original assessment; should be 2)

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly interpreted the ceiling function application, leading to wrong results in some cases. The program needs to correctly apply the ceiling function to ensure the minimal number of wooden bars is computed accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
