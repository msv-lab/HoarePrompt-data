You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1
2

Output
1

Input
5
3
4

Output
6

Input
6
4
2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `total_length` is \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\). If `total_length` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not change `total_length`. Otherwise, `total_length` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\). It calculates the total length as \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\). Depending on whether `total_length` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints either `1` or the result of \(-(-\text{total_length} // n)\). The final state of the program is that it prints either `1` or \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\) based on the condition. The function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it outputs the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the total length required exceeds the length of a single wooden bar correctly. Specifically, the program uses `total_length` directly in the calculation without considering the requirement for solid pieces of wood for each side of the frames. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input
5
3
4

Output
6
```

The total length required for two frames is \(2 \times (3 + 3 + 4) = 20\). Since each wooden bar is of length 5, we need \(20 / 5 = 4\) bars. However, the program incorrectly prints 6, as it uses `-(-total_length // n)` which always rounds up but does not account for the requirement of solid pieces.

To fix this, the program should ensure that each side of the frame is a solid piece of wood. This means that for each dimension (vertical and horizontal), we need to check how many whole bars are required for each part of the frame and sum them up. Here’s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    # Calculate the number of bars needed for vertical sides
    vertical_bars_needed = ((2 * a) + b) // n
    
    # Calculate the number of bars needed for the top side
    top_bars_needed = (2 * b) // n
    
    # Total number of bars needed, ensuring each side is a solid piece
    total_bars_needed = max(vertical_bars_needed, top_bars_needed) * 2
    
    print(total_bars_needed)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each side of the frame is a solid piece of wood and calculates the minimum number of bars needed accordingly.
