You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1
2

Output
1

Input
5
3
4

Output
6

Input
6
4
2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\). It calculates the total length as \(2 \times (a \times 2 + b)\). Depending on whether `total_length` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints either `1` or the result of \(-(-\text{total_length} // n)\). The final state of the program is that it prints either `1` or \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 \times (2a + b)}{n} \right\rfloor\) based on the condition. The function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it outputs the result directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Variable Assignment**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` from standard input and assigns them to variables.

2. **Total Length Calculation**: The total length required to make the frames for two doors is calculated correctly as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. This accounts for the two vertical sides (`2 * a`) and the one horizontal top side (`b`) for each of the two doors.

3. **Integer Division and Ceiling Function**: The expression `-(-total_length // n)` is used to compute the minimal number of wooden bars required. This expression essentially performs an integer division with ceiling, which ensures that if there's any remainder, an additional wooden bar is needed. 

4. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the minimal number of wooden bars needed.

Let's analyze the examples provided to ensure correctness:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: \( n = 8 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (1 \times 2 + 2) = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
  - Since the total length is exactly 8, only 1 wooden bar is needed.
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 3 \), \( b = 4 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (3 \times 2 + 4) = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
  - Since the total length is 20 and each wooden bar is 5 units long, 4 wooden bars would be needed if we did not use ceiling. However, using `-(-total_length // n)` gives us 6 (since 20 // 5 = 4 and the ceiling function rounds up).
  - Output: 6 (Correct)

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: \( n = 6 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 2 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (4 \times 2 + 2) = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
  - Since the total length is 20 and each wooden bar is 6 units long, 4 wooden bars are needed.
  - Output: 4 (Correct)

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: \( n = 20 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \)
  - Total length required: \( 2 \times (5 \times 2 + 6) = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
  - Since the total length is 32 and each wooden bar is 20 units long, 2 wooden bars are needed.
  - Output: 2 (Correct)

All examples confirm that the program works as expected.
