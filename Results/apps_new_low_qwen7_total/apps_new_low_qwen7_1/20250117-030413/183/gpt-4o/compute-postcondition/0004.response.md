The code simply prints 'No', which does not affect any variable values. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is A, b is B, c is C, x is X, y is Y, z is Z, deficit_blue is max(0, X - A), deficit_violet is max(0, Y - B), deficit_orange is max(0, Z - C), extra_blue is max(0, A - X), extra_violet is max(0, B - Y), extra_orange is max(0, C - Z), extra_spheres is extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2, total_deficit is deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange, extra_spheres is less than total_deficit, print statement executed**
