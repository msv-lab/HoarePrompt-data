The code snippet prints 'Yes', but it does not affect any of the variables' values. The print statement itself does not change the values of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `c` is C, `x` is X, `y` is Y, `z` is Z, `deficit_blue` is max(0, X - A), `deficit_violet` is max(0, Y - B), `deficit_orange` is max(0, Z - C), `extra_blue` is max(0, A - X), `extra_violet` is max(0, B - Y), `extra_orange` is max(0, C - Z), `extra_spheres` is extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2, `total_deficit` is deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange, and the print statement outputs 'Yes'**
