You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

- Program:
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the standard input, where each integer is within the range \([0, 1,000,000]\). It then calculates the deficit of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(x - a\), \(y - b\), and \(z - c\), respectively, ensuring the deficits are non-negative. Similarly, it calculates the excess of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(a - x\), \(b - y\), and \(c - z\), again ensuring the excesses are non-negative. The function then computes the total number of extra spheres available, which is the sum of half the excess blue, violet, and orange spheres. Finally, it checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. If the extra spheres are enough to cover the deficit, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Carl can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color.
   - The goal is to determine if Carl can achieve the required number of each color of spheres (`x`, `y`, `z`) by performing such transformations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To find out if Carl can get the required number of spheres, we need to check if the excess spheres (spheres Carl has more than needed) can be used to cover the deficits (shortages of spheres).
   - Specifically, each transformation allows us to reduce the deficit of one color by 1, but we can only use the transformations to reduce deficits by using extra spheres of the same color.

3. **Approach in the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly calculates the deficit for each color (`deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, `deficit_orange`).
   - It also calculates the number of extra spheres available for transformation (`extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, `extra_orange`).
   - The key step is to calculate the total number of transformations that can be performed (`extra_spheres`), which is the sum of half the extra spheres (since two spheres are transformed into one).

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit.
   - If the total number of extra spheres is greater than or equal to the total deficit, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the above analysis, the logic implemented in the provided code is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.
