Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the initial number of spheres (a, b, c) and the target number of spheres (x, y, z) from the input.
2. It calculates the deficit for each color separately (`deficit_blue`, `deficit_violet`, `deficit_orange`) and the excess for each color separately (`extra_blue`, `extra_violet`, `extra_orange`).
3. The number of extra spheres that can be transformed (`extra_spheres`) is calculated by dividing the excess of each color by 2 and summing these values. This accounts for the fact that two spheres of the same color can be transformed into one sphere of another color in one move.
4. The total deficit (`total_deficit`) is the sum of the deficits for all colors.
5. The program checks if the number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given this analysis, the logic of the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program should work as intended for the described problem.

Correctness: **True**
