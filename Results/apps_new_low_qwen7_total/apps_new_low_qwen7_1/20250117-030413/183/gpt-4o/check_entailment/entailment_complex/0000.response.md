Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the initial number of blue, violet, and orange spheres (`a`, `b`, `c`) and the required number of each (`x`, `y`, `z`) from the input.
2. It calculates the deficit for each color by subtracting the required amount from the current amount and ensures the result is non-negative using `max(0, ...)`.
3. It calculates the excess for each color similarly but ensures it's non-negative.
4. The program correctly calculates the total number of extra spheres available by dividing the excess of each color by 2 and summing these values.
5. It then checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. This is done by comparing the total extra spheres with the total deficit.
6. Based on the comparison, the program prints 'Yes' if there are enough extra spheres to cover the deficit, or 'No' otherwise.

Given that all calculations and logic steps appear to be implemented correctly according to the problem description, the program should work as intended under the assumptions and constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
