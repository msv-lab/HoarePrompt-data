Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, x, y, z <= 1,000,000.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)

deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)

deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)

extra_blue = max(0, a - x)

extra_violet = max(0, b - y)

extra_orange = max(0, c - z)

extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2

total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is A, `b` is B, `c` is C, `x` is X, `y` is Y, `z` is Z, `deficit_blue` is max(0, X - A), `deficit_violet` is max(0, Y - B), `deficit_orange` is max(0, Z - C), `extra_blue` is max(0, A - X), `extra_violet` is max(0, B - Y), `extra_orange` is max(0, C - Z), `extra_spheres` is extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2, `total_deficit` is deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange, if `extra_spheres` is greater than or equal to `total_deficit`, the print statement outputs 'Yes'. Otherwise, the print statement indicates that `extra_spheres` is less than `total_deficit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the standard input, where each integer is within the range \([0, 1,000,000]\). It then calculates the deficit of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(x - a\), \(y - b\), and \(z - c\), respectively, ensuring the deficits are non-negative. Similarly, it calculates the excess of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(a - x\), \(b - y\), and \(c - z\), again ensuring the excesses are non-negative. The function then computes the total number of extra spheres available, which is the sum of half the excess blue, violet, and orange spheres. Finally, it checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. If the extra spheres are enough to cover the deficit, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
