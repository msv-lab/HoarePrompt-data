The function reads six non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the standard input, where each integer is within the range \([0, 1,000,000]\). It then calculates the deficit of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(x - a\), \(y - b\), and \(z - c\), respectively, ensuring the deficits are non-negative. Similarly, it calculates the excess of blue, violet, and orange spheres as \(a - x\), \(b - y\), and \(c - z\), again ensuring the excesses are non-negative. The function then computes the total number of extra spheres available, which is the sum of half the excess blue, violet, and orange spheres. Finally, it checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. If the extra spheres are enough to cover the deficit, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
