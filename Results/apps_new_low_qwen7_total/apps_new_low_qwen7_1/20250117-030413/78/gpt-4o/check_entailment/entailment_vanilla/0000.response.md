Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where the total sum of the sequence is already odd. In this case, it simply prints the total sum, which is correct.
2. For the case where the total sum is even, the program tries to maximize the sum of a subsequence with an odd sum by removing either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number.
3. The approach to handle the cases where there might not be any positive or negative odd numbers is correct. Using `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` ensures that the initial values are large enough to be replaced.
4. The final result is obtained by subtracting the appropriate value (smallest positive odd or largest negative odd) from the total sum and taking the maximum of these two possible results.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly identify and compute the maximum subsequence sum that is odd.

Correctness: **True**
