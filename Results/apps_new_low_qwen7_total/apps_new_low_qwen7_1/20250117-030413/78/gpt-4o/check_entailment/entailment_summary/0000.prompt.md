Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))





# Execution Summary:
The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, ensuring that the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum. It then calculates and prints the maximum value among either subtracting the smallest positive odd number from the total sum, or subtracting the largest negative odd number from the total sum. If there are no positive odd numbers or no negative odd numbers, it handles these cases appropriately by setting the respective variables to infinity or negative infinity, respectively. The function guarantees that it will always produce a result based on the given input constraints.
