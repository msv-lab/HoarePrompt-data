Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^4 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_sum = sum(a)

min_positive_odd = float('inf')

max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        print(total_sum)
    else :
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers).
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

print(max(result1, result2))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers). If `total_sum` is not divisible by 2, the function continues without further changes. Otherwise, the function calculates `result1` as `total_sum - min_positive_odd` if `min_positive_odd` is not infinity, and `result2` as `total_sum - max_negative_odd` if `max_negative_odd` is not negative infinity, then prints the maximum of `result1` and `result2`.
