Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the maximum subsequence sum with an odd sum. However, the current implementation has a logical error. Specifically, the program calculates `result1` and `result2` but does not handle the case where the list might contain only negative odd numbers or only positive odd numbers correctly. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `result1` and `result2`:**
   - `result1` is calculated as `total_sum - min_positive_odd` if `min_positive_odd` is not infinity. This approach aims to remove the smallest positive odd number from the total sum to make it odd.
   - `result2` is calculated as `total_sum - max_negative_odd` if `max_negative_odd` is not negative infinity. This approach aims to remove the largest negative odd number from the total sum to make it odd.

2. **Handling the edge cases:**
   - If the list contains only negative odd numbers, `min_positive_odd` will remain infinity, and `result1` will be `-inf`.
   - If the list contains only positive odd numbers, `max_negative_odd` will remain negative infinity, and `result2` will be `-inf`.

Given these issues, the program fails to handle cases where the list contains exclusively negative or positive odd numbers. Instead, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Sum of All Numbers:** Calculate the total sum of the sequence.
2. **Identify Positive and Negative Odd Numbers:**
   - Find the smallest positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`).
   - Find the largest negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`).
3. **Calculate Potential Results:**
   - Subtract `min_positive_odd` from the total sum if `min_positive_odd` exists.
   - Subtract `max_negative_odd` from the total sum if `max_negative_odd` exists.
4. **Return the Maximum Result:**
   - Return the maximum value between the two potential results.

Given the above considerations, the current implementation is incomplete and would fail in scenarios where the list contains exclusively negative or positive odd numbers.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
