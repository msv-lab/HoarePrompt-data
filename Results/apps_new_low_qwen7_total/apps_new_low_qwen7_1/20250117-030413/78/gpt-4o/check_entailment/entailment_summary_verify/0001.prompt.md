You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, ensuring that the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum. It then calculates and prints the maximum value among either subtracting the smallest positive odd number from the total sum, or subtracting the largest negative odd number from the total sum. If there are no positive odd numbers or no negative odd numbers, it handles these cases appropriately by setting the respective variables to infinity or negative infinity, respectively. The function guarantees that it will always produce a result based on the given input constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where the total sum of the sequence is already odd. In this case, it simply prints the total sum, which is correct.
2. For the case where the total sum is even, the program tries to maximize the sum of a subsequence with an odd sum by removing either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number.
3. The approach to handle the cases where there might not be any positive or negative odd numbers is correct. Using `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` ensures that the initial values are large enough to be replaced.
4. The final result is obtained by subtracting the appropriate value (smallest positive odd or largest negative odd) from the total sum and taking the maximum of these two possible results.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly identify and compute the maximum subsequence sum that is odd.
