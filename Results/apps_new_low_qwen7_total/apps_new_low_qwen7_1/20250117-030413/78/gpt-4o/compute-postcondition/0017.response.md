Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is an integer.
- \( a \) is a list of \( n \) integers with at least one element.
- \( total_sum \) is the sum of all integers in the list \( a \).
- \( min_positive_odd \) is the smallest positive odd integer in the list \( a \) considering the updated \( num \).
- \( num \) is the next integer in the list \( a \).

### Loop Head:
```
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
   - After each iteration, `num` is set to the next element in the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `num` is the next integer in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Consider the Update of `min_positive_odd`:**
   - If `num` is an odd number and greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `num`.
   - If `num` is not an odd number or is less than or equal to 0, `min_positive_odd` remains unchanged.

### Updated States for the Next Iteration:
- \( n \) remains unchanged.
- \( a \) remains unchanged.
- \( total_sum \) remains unchanged.
- \( min_positive_odd \) may or may not change based on the value of `num`.
- \( num \) will be the next element in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the only state that changes is `num`, which will be the next element in the list `a`. The other states remain the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` considering the updated `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`**.
