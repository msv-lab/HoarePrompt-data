Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers). The sum of all integers in the list `a` is even.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        if num > 0:
            min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
        else:
            max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (updated to be the smaller of its current value and `num` if `num` is positive), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (updated to be the maximum of its current value and `num` if `num` is even).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` considering the updated `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `num` is an odd number and greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `num`. If `num` is not an odd number or is less than or equal to 0, `min_positive_odd` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` considering the updated `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `num` is greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated to the smallest positive odd integer between its current value and `num`. If `num` is not greater than 0, `max_negative_odd` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `num`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
