Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` considering the updated `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `num` is an odd number and greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `num`. If `num` is not an odd number or is less than or equal to 0, `min_positive_odd` remains unchanged.***
