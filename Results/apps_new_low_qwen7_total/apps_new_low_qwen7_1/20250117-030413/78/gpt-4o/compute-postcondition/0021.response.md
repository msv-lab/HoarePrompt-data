Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` considering the updated `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `num` is greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated to the smallest positive odd integer between its current value and `num`. If `num` is not greater than 0, `max_negative_odd` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `num`.***
