The code `min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)` updates the value of `min_positive_odd` to be the minimum of its current value and the current value of `num`. 

- Initially, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a`.
- `num` is the next integer in the list `a`.

After executing the line of code, `min_positive_odd` will be updated to be the smaller of its current value and `num`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer between its current value and the next integer in the list `a`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a`.**
