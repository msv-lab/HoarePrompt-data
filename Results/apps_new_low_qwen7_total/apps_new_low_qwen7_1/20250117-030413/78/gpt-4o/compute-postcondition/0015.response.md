Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum of the current `min_positive_odd` and `num`, `num` is the next integer in the list `a`, and if `num` is greater than 0, `min_positive_odd` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `max_negative_odd` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `num`.**
