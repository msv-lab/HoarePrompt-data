Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers). The sum of all integers in the list `a` is even.**
