The code `print(total_sum)` prints the value of `total_sum` but does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers), and `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` which is not divisible by 2.**
