The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the sequence, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^4 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.

The function then processes this input and returns either a boolean value indicating whether a subsequence with an odd sum exists or some other relevant information based on the problem's requirements.

Given the problem description, the function does not need to return anything explicitly since the existence of a subsequence with an odd sum is guaranteed by the input constraints. However, based on the standard format, we would describe it as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads a sequence of integers from input, and returns whether a subsequence with an odd sum exists (which is guaranteed by the input constraints).**
