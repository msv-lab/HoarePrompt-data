Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (updated to be the smaller of its current value and `num` if `num` is positive), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (updated to be the maximum of its current value and `num` if `num` is even).***
