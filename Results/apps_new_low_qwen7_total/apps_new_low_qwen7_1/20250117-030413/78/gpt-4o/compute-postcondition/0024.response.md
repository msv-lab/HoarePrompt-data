Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the smallest positive odd integer in the list `a` (or infinity if there are no positive odd integers), `max_negative_odd` is the largest negative odd integer in the list `a` (or negative infinity if there are no negative odd integers). If `total_sum` is not divisible by 2, the function continues without further changes. Otherwise, the function calculates `result1` as `total_sum - min_positive_odd` if `min_positive_odd` is not infinity, and `result2` as `total_sum - max_negative_odd` if `max_negative_odd` is not negative infinity, then prints the maximum of `result1` and `result2`.**
