The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, ensuring that the sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum. It then calculates and prints the maximum value among either subtracting the smallest positive odd number from the total sum, or subtracting the largest negative odd number from the total sum. If there are no positive odd numbers or no negative odd numbers, it handles these cases appropriately by setting the respective variables to infinity or negative infinity, respectively. The function guarantees that it will always produce a result based on the given input constraints.
