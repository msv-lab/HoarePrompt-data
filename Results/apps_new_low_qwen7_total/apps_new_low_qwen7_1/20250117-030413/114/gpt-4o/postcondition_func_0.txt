The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer within the range of 0 to 8 inclusive. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\), then divides \(10^k\) by their GCD to simplify the multiplication, and finally returns the product of `n` and the simplified \(10^k\). The function handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges and ensures that the returned value is always an integer. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the function correctly handles the case when `n` and \(10^k\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1), as the division by the GCD will result in the original \(10^k\).
