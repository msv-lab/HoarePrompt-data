The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function returns `x`, which is the result of \(n \times (10^k)\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 8 inclusive, and returns `x`, which is the product of `n` and \(10^k\).**
