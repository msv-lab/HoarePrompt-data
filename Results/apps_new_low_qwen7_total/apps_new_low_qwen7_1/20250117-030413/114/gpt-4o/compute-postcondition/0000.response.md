Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, x is n * (10 ** k)**

Explanation:
1. The first line initializes `multiplier` to `10 ** k`.
2. The second line calculates `x` as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.

Given that `multiplier` is `10 ** k`, where `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `multiplier` will be a power of 10 ranging from 1 to 100,000,000. 

Since `math.gcd(n, 10 ** k)` will always be 1 (because `n` is a positive integer and `10 ** k` is a power of 10, and their greatest common divisor cannot be greater than 1 unless `n` itself is a power of 10, which is not guaranteed), the expression simplifies to `x = n * (10 ** k)`.

Thus, `x` is updated to `n * (10 ** k)`, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
