You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program:
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) inclusive, and `k` is an integer within the range of 0 to 8 inclusive. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and \(10^k\), then divides \(10^k\) by their GCD to simplify the multiplication, and finally returns the product of `n` and the simplified \(10^k\). The function handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges and ensures that the returned value is always an integer. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the function correctly handles the case when `n` and \(10^k\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1), as the division by the GCD will result in the original \(10^k\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is already divisible by `10 ** k`. In such cases, the current implementation returns `n * (10 ** k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum positive integer ending with `k` or more zeros and divisible by `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 125` and `k = 3`. The correct 3-rounding of 125 is `125 * 8 = 1000`, but the program would return `125 * (10 ** 3) = 125000`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the returned value is the smallest multiple of `10 ** k` that is also a multiple of `n`. We can achieve this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `n` and `10 ** k` and then dividing it by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `10 ** k`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```

This ensures that the result is the smallest number ending with `k` or more zeros and divisible by `n`.
