### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` to get `n` and `k`. This step is accurate and does not introduce any errors.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program correctly calls the function `func_1(n, k)` which is intended to perform the k-rounding operation. This step is also accurate.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Multiplier Calculation**:
     ```python
     multiplier = 10 ** k
     ```
     This correctly calculates the number needed to add `k` trailing zeros.
   
   - **GCD Calculation**:
     ```python
     gcd_value = math.gcd(n, multiplier)
     ```
     This calculates the greatest common divisor between `n` and `10^k`.

   - **Multiplier Adjustment**:
     ```python
     adjusted_multiplier = multiplier // gcd_value
     ```
     This adjustment ensures that the multiplier is simplified by removing any common factors between `n` and `10^k`, ensuring the result is the smallest multiple of `n` that ends with at least `k` zeros.

   - **Final Calculation**:
     ```python
     x = n * adjusted_multiplier
     ```
     This calculates the smallest number ending with `k` zeros that is divisible by `n`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns this calculated value, which is the desired k-rounding of `n`.

To verify the correctness of the function, let's consider the function summary provided:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of `n` and `10^k`.
- It simplifies the multiplier by dividing it by the GCD, ensuring the smallest multiple of `n` with at least `k` trailing zeros.
- The function handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges and ensures that the returned value is always an integer.

Given the problem statement and the function logic, the program correctly implements the k-rounding operation for the given constraints. The function summary aligns with the function logic, and there are no contradictions or issues identified.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
