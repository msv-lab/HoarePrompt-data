You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000

- Program: 
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x



- Annotated Code: 
import math

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k

x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x which is n * (10^k)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` to get `n` and `k`.

2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` which is supposed to perform the k-rounding operation.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Multiplier Calculation**: `multiplier = 10 ** k` calculates the number needed to add `k` trailing zeros.
   - **GCD Calculation**: `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor between `n` and the `multiplier`.
   - **Multiplier Adjustment**: `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` adjusts the multiplier by removing any common factors between `n` and the original multiplier, ensuring we get the smallest possible multiple of `n` that ends with at least `k` zeros.

4. **Final Calculation**: `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` calculates the smallest number ending with `k` zeros that is divisible by `n`.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns this calculated value, which is the desired k-rounding of `n`.

Given the problem statement and the function logic, the program correctly implements the k-rounding operation for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
