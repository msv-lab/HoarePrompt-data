Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` to get `n` and `k`.

2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` which is supposed to perform the k-rounding operation.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Multiplier Calculation**: `multiplier = 10 ** k` calculates the number needed to add `k` trailing zeros.
   - **GCD Calculation**: `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor between `n` and the `multiplier`.
   - **Multiplier Adjustment**: `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` adjusts the multiplier by removing any common factors between `n` and the original multiplier, ensuring we get the smallest possible multiple of `n` that ends with at least `k` zeros.

4. **Final Calculation**: `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` calculates the smallest number ending with `k` zeros that is divisible by `n`.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns this calculated value, which is the desired k-rounding of `n`.

Given the problem statement and the function logic, the program correctly implements the k-rounding operation for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
