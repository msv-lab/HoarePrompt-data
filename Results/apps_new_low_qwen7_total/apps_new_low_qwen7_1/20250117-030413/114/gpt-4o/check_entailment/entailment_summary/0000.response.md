Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the k-rounding of a given positive integer \( n \). The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for calculating the k-rounding by:

1. Calculating \( 10^k \).
2. Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( n \) and \( 10^k \).
3. Dividing \( 10^k \) by the GCD to simplify the multiplication.
4. Returning the product of \( n \) and the simplified \( 10^k \).

This approach ensures that the returned value is the smallest integer that ends with at least \( k \) zeros and is divisible by \( n \).

- When \( n \) and \( 10^k \) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1), the simplified \( 10^k \) remains \( 10^k \), and the product is \( n \cdot 10^k \).
- When \( n \) and \( 10^k \) share common factors, dividing \( 10^k \) by their GCD ensures that the final product has exactly \( k \) trailing zeros and is still divisible by \( n \).

The provided execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function and mentions handling all valid inputs within the specified ranges. Therefore, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
