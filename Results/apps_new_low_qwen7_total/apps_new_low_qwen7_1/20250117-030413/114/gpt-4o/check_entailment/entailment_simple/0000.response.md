### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) that ends with at least \( k \) zeros and is divisible by \( n \).

2. **Approach**: 
   - To ensure \( x \) ends with at least \( k \) zeros, \( x \) must be a multiple of \( 10^k \).
   - The goal is to find the smallest multiple of \( n \) that is also a multiple of \( 10^k \).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly imports necessary modules.
   - It reads the inputs \( n \) and \( k \) from standard input.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to perform the required calculation.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Line 7**: `multiplier = 10 ** k` calculates the number of trailing zeros needed.
   - **Line 8**: `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` computes the smallest \( x \) that is a multiple of both \( n \) and \( 10^k \). 

5. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The expression `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` ensures that \( x \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of \( n \) and \( 10^k \).
   - Since \( 10^k \) has only factors of 2 and 5, and assuming \( n \) does not share all these factors, this formula correctly finds the smallest multiple of both \( n \) and \( 10^k \).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n \) already ends with \( k \) or more zeros, the result should be \( n \) itself.
   - If \( k = 0 \), \( 10^0 = 1 \), and any \( n \) remains unchanged.

7. **Verification**:
   - Given examples and constraints, the code handles all possible values of \( n \) and \( k \) correctly.

The given program logic is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
