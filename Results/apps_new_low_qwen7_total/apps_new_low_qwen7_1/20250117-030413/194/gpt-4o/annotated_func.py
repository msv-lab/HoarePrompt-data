#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2x2 matrix `A` represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (a, b, c, d) such that -10^9 <= a, b, c, d <= 10^9. It calculates the determinant of the matrix and checks if it is zero. If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0.

If the determinant is non-zero, the function then determines which element (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`) has the largest absolute value. Based on this determination, it calculates a modified value (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, or `d_prime`) using specific formulas and assigns the minimum difference between the original element and its modified counterpart to `min_norm_value`.

The function returns `min_norm_value`. There are several edge cases and missing functionalities in the code:

1. If `d` is zero when calculating `a_prime`, the function does not handle this case properly; it should return a default value or handle division by zero appropriately.
2. Similarly, if `c` is zero when calculating `b_prime`, the function does not handle this case.
3. If `b` is zero when calculating `c_prime`, the function does not handle this case.
4. If `a` is zero when calculating `d_prime`, the function does not handle this case properly; it should return a default value or handle division by zero appropriately.

In summary, the function returns either 0.0 if the determinant is zero, or the minimum difference between an element and its modified counterpart, depending on which element has the largest absolute value. The function does not handle division by zero in certain scenarios, which could lead to errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that |a|, |b|, |c|, |d| â‰¤ 10^9. The matrix A is represented as a 2x2 list of lists, where A = [[a, b], [c, d]].
def func_2():
    data = input().split()

a, b = int(data[0]), int(data[1])

c, d = int(data[2]), int(data[3])

result = func_1(A)

print(f'{result:.10f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers from standard input, constructs a 2x2 matrix `A` using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with `A` as its argument, and prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. If the input integers are outside the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), the function will still read them but may produce unexpected results since the constraints are not enforced. There is no explicit handling of invalid input types; the function assumes that the input is always a list of integers.
