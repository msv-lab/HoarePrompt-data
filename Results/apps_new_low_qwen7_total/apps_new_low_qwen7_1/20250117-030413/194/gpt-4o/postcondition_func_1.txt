The function reads four integers from standard input, constructs a 2x2 matrix `A` using these integers, calls another function `func_1` with `A` as its argument, and prints the result of `func_1` rounded to 10 decimal places. If the input integers are outside the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), the function will still read them but may produce unexpected results since the constraints are not enforced. There is no explicit handling of invalid input types; the function assumes that the input is always a list of integers.
