Postcondition: **`a` is A[0][0], `b` is A[0][1], `c` is A[1][0], `d` is A[1][1], `det` is A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0], and the absolute value of `b`, `c`, and `d` are all less than or equal to the absolute value of `a`. The current value of `c` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `b`, and `d`.**
