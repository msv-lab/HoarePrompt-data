Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a 2x2 matrix `A` represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (a, b, c, d) such that -10^9 <= a, b, c, d <= 10^9. It calculates the determinant of the matrix and checks if it is zero. If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0.

If the determinant is non-zero, the function then determines which element (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`) has the largest absolute value. Based on this determination, it calculates a modified value (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, or `d_prime`) using specific formulas and assigns the minimum difference between the original element and its modified counterpart to `min_norm_value`.

The function returns `min_norm_value`. There are several edge cases and missing functionalities in the code:

1. If `d` is zero when calculating `a_prime`, the function does not handle this case properly; it should return a default value or handle division by zero appropriately.
2. Similarly, if `c` is zero when calculating `b_prime`, the function does not handle this case.
3. If `b` is zero when calculating `c_prime`, the function does not handle this case.
4. If `a` is zero when calculating `d_prime`, the function does not handle this case properly; it should return a default value or handle division by zero appropriately.

In summary, the function returns either 0.0 if the determinant is zero, or the minimum difference between an element and its modified counterpart, depending on which element has the largest absolute value. The function does not handle division by zero in certain scenarios, which could lead to errors.**
