The provided code snippet reads four integers from input, splits them, and assigns the first two to variables `a` and `b`, and the next two to variables `c` and `d`. It then constructs a 2x2 matrix `A` using these values and calls a function `func_1(A)`. The result of this function call is printed with 10 decimal places. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so we cannot determine its exact behavior or output without additional information. 

Given the lack of the definition for `func_1`, we can only describe the state after reading the input and constructing the matrix `A`. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will hold the values read from input, and the matrix `A` will be constructed accordingly. Since no further operations are specified on `A` within the given code, we will assume `func_1` does not modify `A` and only prints its result.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and the matrix `A`, but not the actual result of `func_1(A)` because its implementation is unknown.

Output State: **a, b, c, and d are integers, A is [[a, b], [c, d]], the result of func_1(A) is printed with 10 decimal places**
