Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `det`, `min_norm_value`, and `d_prime` are as follows: if the absolute value of `c` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `b`, and `d`, then `d_prime` is set to 0 (if `a` is zero) or \(\frac{b \cdot c}{a}\) (if `a` is non-zero), and `min_norm_value` is \( |d - d_{\text{prime}}| \). Otherwise, `min_norm_value` is 3.67, `a` is 5, `b` is 3, `c` is 3.33, and `d` is 2.**
