Output State: **a is A[0][0], b is A[0][1], c is A[1][0], d is A[1][1], det is A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0], b_prime is (A[0][0] * A[1][1]) / A[1][0] if A[1][0] != 0 else 0, min_norm_value is |A[0][1] - (A[0][0] * A[1][1]) / A[1][0]| if A[1][0] != 0 else 0, and the absolute value of b, c, and d are all greater than the absolute value of a**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `b_prime` using the formula \( b' = \frac{a \cdot d}{c} \) if `c` is not zero, otherwise `b_prime` is set to 0. Given the precondition, we know that the absolute value of `b`, `c`, and `d` are all greater than the absolute value of `a`, and `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`. This means that if `c` is not zero, the value of `b_prime` is calculated as specified.
2. The second line calculates `min_norm_value` as the absolute difference between `b` and `b_prime`. If `c` is not zero, then `b_prime` is a specific value based on the precondition. If `c` is zero, `b_prime` is 0, and `min_norm_value` is simply the absolute value of `b`.

Since no other variables are affected, the final state includes the updated values of `b_prime` and `min_norm_value` based on the conditions provided, along with the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `det`.
