Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `det`, `min_norm_value`, `a_prime`, and `d_prime` are as follows: if the absolute value of `a` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `b`, `c`, and `d`, then `a_prime` is 0 and `min_norm_value` is `abs(a)`. Otherwise, if the absolute value of `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`, then `d_prime` is set to \(\frac{A[0][0] \cdot A[1][1]}{A[1][0]}\) if `A[1][0]` is non-zero, and `min_norm_value` is \( |A[0][1] - \frac{A[0][0] \cdot A[1][1]}{A[1][0]}| \) if `A[1][0]` is non-zero. Otherwise, `min_norm_value` is 3.67, `a` is 5, `b` is 3, `c` is 3.33, and `d` is 2.**
