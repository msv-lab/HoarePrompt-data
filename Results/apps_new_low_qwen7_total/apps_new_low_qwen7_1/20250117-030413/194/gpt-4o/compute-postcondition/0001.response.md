The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it defines a matrix `A` as a 2x2 list of lists, where `A = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, and the constraints are that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers such that \(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d| \leq 10^9\).

Based on the given information, the function likely calculates something related to the matrix, but since no specific operation or return value is mentioned, we focus solely on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but involves a matrix A defined as [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, and d are integers with \(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d| \leq 10^9\).**
