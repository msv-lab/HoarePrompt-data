Output State: **a is A[0][0], b is A[0][1], c is A[1][0], d is A[1][1], det is A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0] and det is not equal to 0, the absolute value of a is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of b, c, and d, a_prime is 0, min_norm_value is abs(a)**

Explanation:
1. The line `a_prime = b * c / d if d != 0 else 0` checks if `d` is not equal to 0. Given the precondition that `det` (which is `A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0])` is not equal to 0, it implies `d` is not zero. Therefore, `a_prime` is calculated as `b * c / d`.
2. However, since `d` is already derived from `det` and we know `det` is not zero, the `if d != 0` condition is always true, so `a_prime` simplifies to `b * c / d`.
3. The line `min_norm_value = abs(a - a_prime)` calculates the absolute difference between the original value of `a` and the new value of `a_prime`.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that `d` is not zero, the only changes to the state are the introduction of `a_prime` and the calculation of `min_norm_value`. Since `d` is non-zero, `a_prime` is computed, and `min_norm_value` is the absolute difference between `a` and `a_prime`. However, without specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we can only express `a_prime` and `min_norm_value` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state is as described above.
