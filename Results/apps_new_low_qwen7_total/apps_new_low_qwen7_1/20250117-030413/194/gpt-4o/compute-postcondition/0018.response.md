The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is a 2x2 matrix represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (a, b, c, d) such that -10^9 <= a, b, c, d <= 10^9. 

- If the minimum norm value is 0.0, the function returns 0.0.
- Otherwise, if the absolute value of `a` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `b`, `c`, and `d`, the function returns 5.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2x2 matrix `A` and return either 0.0 or 5 based on the conditions described.
