The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `a`, a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\). The function then checks if the elements of the list `a` can be aligned with the list `b` (which contains the number of days in each month of a year) in a cyclic manner such that each element of `a` matches an element of `b`. If such an alignment exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
