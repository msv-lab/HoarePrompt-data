The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost enclosing block. In this case, since there is no loop or block being explicitly mentioned to exit, the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is either 0 or 11
- `f` remains True
- Lists `a` and `b` must still satisfy the condition `a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12]` for all `j` in the range `n`.
- If `i` is 11 and `f` is not True, then `f` remains True. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.

The `break` statement does not affect these conditions or the values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 11, `f` remains True, and lists `a` and `b` must still satisfy the condition `a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12]` for all `j` in the range `n`. If `i` is 11 and `f` is not True, then `f` remains True. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.**
