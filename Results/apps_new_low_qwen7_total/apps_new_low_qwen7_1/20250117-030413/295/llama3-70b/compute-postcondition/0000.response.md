Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, a is a list of integers where each integer a_i is such that 28 ≤ a_i ≤ 31, b is a list [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], f is False**

Explanation:
- The first line takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`.
- The second line takes a space-separated string of integers as input, converts each to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list, assigning it to `a`.
- The third line initializes `b` as a predefined list `[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]`.
- The fourth line initializes `f` to `False`.

No other operations modify the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `f`. Therefore, the final state includes the updated `n` and `a`, the unchanged `b`, and the initialized `f`.
