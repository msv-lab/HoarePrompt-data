Postcondition: ***`i` is either 1 or 0, `f` is True, and lists `a` and `b` must still satisfy the condition `a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12]` for all `j` in the range `n`. This condition remains unchanged because the if condition checks an additional element in list `b` which does not affect the original condition given the absence of the else part.***
