Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 11, `f` is True, and lists `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) for all \(j\) in the range \(n\). If the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) holds for the current `i`, the output is 'YES' and the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' and the state remains unchanged.***
