Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and `a`, a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\). The function then checks if the elements of the list `a` can be aligned with the list `b` (which contains the number of days in each month of a year) in a cyclic manner such that each element of `a` matches an element of `b`. If such an alignment exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If any element in the list `a` is not within the range 28 to 31, the function should ideally raise an error or handle it appropriately. However, the given code does not check for this condition explicitly.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where the input values are outside the specified ranges. While the annotation suggests checking this, the actual code does not implement this check. Therefore, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 24, or if any element in `a` is not between 28 and 31, the function's behavior might be undefined or incorrect based on the current implementation.
