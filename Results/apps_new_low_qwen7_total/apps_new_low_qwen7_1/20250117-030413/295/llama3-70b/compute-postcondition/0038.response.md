The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), and each `a_i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq n\)) is an integer such that \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\). 

Based on the output provided, there are two cases:
- **Case_1**: If any `a_i` is not between 28 and 31, the function returns an error message indicating that all `a_i` should be within the range 28 to 31.
- **Case_2**: If all `a_i` are within the range 28 to 31, the function does not explicitly state a return value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 24\) and \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\). It returns an error message if any `a_i` is outside the specified range, and does not return anything if all `a_i` are within the range.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\) and each `a_i` is an integer such that \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\). If any `a_i` is not within the range 28 to 31, it returns an error message; otherwise, it does not return anything.**
