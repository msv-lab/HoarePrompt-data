The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `f`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output printed, but the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 11, `f` is True, and lists `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) for all \(j\) in the range \(n\). Printed: NO**
