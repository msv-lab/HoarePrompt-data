Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the leap year condition for February. Specifically, the program always assumes February has 28 days, which means it cannot correctly identify sequences that include a February with 29 days (a leap year February). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
29 31 30
```
This sequence should be valid for the months February (leap year), March, and April. However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not account for the possibility of a February with 29 days.
