Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if a sequence of month durations `a` can match the durations of consecutive months in the Gregorian calendar. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of months `n` and the list of month durations `a`.
2. **Calendar Data**: It uses a fixed list `b` representing the number of days in each month of a non-leap year.
3. **Cyclic Comparison**: The program checks if the list `a` can align with `b` or the list shifted by one month (`b` plus 12 positions).
4. **Flag Setting**: If a valid alignment is found, it sets the flag `f` to `True`.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints 'YES' if a valid alignment is found, otherwise 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program appears to be correctly implementing the required functionality. The logic ensures that every possible shift of the month list `b` is checked against the input list `a`.

Correctness: **True**
