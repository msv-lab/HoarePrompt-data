You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are integers such that 28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: \(i\) is either 0 or 11, `f` is True, and lists `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) for all \(j\) in the range \(n\). If \(i\) is 11 and \(f\) is False, the loop will break out, but since `f` is set to True in the if conditions, this scenario is not possible. Therefore, `f` will always be True after the loop completes, as long as the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) holds for some \(i\) in the range of 0 to 11.
    if f :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is either 0 or 11, `f` is True, and lists `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) for all \(j\) in the range \(n\). If the condition \(a[j] == b[(i + j) \% 12]\) holds for the current `i`, the output is 'YES' and the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' and the state remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the leap year condition for February. Specifically, the program always assumes February has 28 days, which means it cannot correctly identify sequences that include a February with 29 days (a leap year February). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
29 31 30
```
This sequence should be valid for the months February (leap year), March, and April. However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not account for the possibility of a February with 29 days.
