    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`max_full_sets` is `m // k`, `remaining_correct` is `m % k`, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `m` is an integer such that `0 ≤ m ≤ n`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, and the score is calculated based on the following conditions: if `m <= n - n // k`, then `score` is `m % MOD`; otherwise, additional variables like `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers` are calculated, and `score` is recalculated accordingly.
    return score
    #The program returns `score` which is calculated as follows: if `m <= n - n // k`, then `score` is `m % MOD`; otherwise, `excess_full_sets = (n - m) // k`, `remaining_correct_answers = (n - m) % k`, and `score` is `(m % MOD) - excess_full_sets + remaining_correct`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It returns a score based on the following conditions:

1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is `m % MOD`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as `(n - m) // k` and `remaining_correct_answers` as `(n - m) % k`. The score is then calculated as `(m % MOD) - excess_full_sets + remaining_correct_answers`.

This function handles all edge cases where the conditions for the score calculation are met. It ensures that the score is computed correctly based on the given inputs and the specified rules.
