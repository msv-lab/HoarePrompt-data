Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the scenario where the number of full sets of consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) might be less than the number of required full sets to achieve the minimum score.

Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this issue:

### Case Analysis:
Consider the input `n = 7`, `m = 4`, `k = 2`.

- The maximum number of full sets of consecutive correct answers is `m // k = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- The remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets is `m % k = 4 % 2 = 0`.

However, to achieve the minimum score, we need to ensure that the remaining correct answers are maximized while minimizing the number of full sets. In this case, the optimal strategy is to place the correct answers in such a way that we maximize the number of full sets before placing the last correct answer.

### Expected Behavior:
- If we place the correct answers in positions 1, 2, 5, and 7, we get 2 full sets (1-2 and 5-6) and 1 additional correct answer (position 7).
- This results in a score of `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`, because each full set doubles the score, and the final correct answer adds 1 point.

### Program Output:
- The program calculates the score as follows:
  - `max_full_sets = 2`
  - `remaining_correct = 0`
  - Since `m > n - n // k` is not true, it enters the else block.
  - `excess_full_sets = 2 - (7 - 4) // (2 - 1) = 2 - 3 = -1` (which is incorrect logic)
  - `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - (-1) * 2 = 6` (which is incorrect)
  - The final score calculation is incorrect due to the negative value for `excess_full_sets`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of full sets is less than the number of required full sets to achieve the minimum score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
