### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and verify if the provided code accurately computes the minimum possible score for Manao under the given conditions.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is the total number of questions.
   - `m` is the number of correct answers.
   - `k` is the threshold for doubling the score after `k-1` consecutive correct answers.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - `max_full_sets`: This calculates the maximum number of complete sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve.
   - `remaining_correct`: This calculates the number of correct answers left after accounting for the full sets.
   - The main logic involves:
     - If `m` (number of correct answers) is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then Manao can't achieve any doubling of scores, so the score is just `m % MOD`.
     - Otherwise, we calculate how many more complete sets (`excess_full_sets`) Manao can get beyond the initial `max_full_sets`.
     - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of correct answers left after these additional full sets.
     - The score is calculated using the formula involving modular exponentiation and subtraction.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The formula used ensures that Manao minimizes his score by accounting for the doubling effect efficiently.
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`) to handle large numbers without overflow.
   - The final score is taken modulo `1000000009` to fit within standard integer limits.

Given the detailed breakdown and the correct application of the algorithm, the provided code seems to follow the problem requirements accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the minimum possible score for Manao under the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
