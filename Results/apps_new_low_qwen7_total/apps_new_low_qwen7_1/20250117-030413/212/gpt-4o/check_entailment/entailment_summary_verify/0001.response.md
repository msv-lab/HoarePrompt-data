### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and verify if the provided code accurately computes the minimum possible score for Manao under the given conditions.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is the total number of questions.
   - `m` is the number of correct answers.
   - `k` is the threshold for doubling the score after `k-1` consecutive correct answers.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to compute the minimum possible score based on the given inputs.
   - The core logic is divided into two main parts:
     - If `m` (number of correct answers) is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then Manao can't achieve any doubling of scores, so the score is just `m % MOD`.
     - Otherwise, the function calculates how many more complete sets (`excess_full_sets`) Manao can get beyond the initial `max_full_sets`.
     - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of correct answers left after these additional full sets.
     - The score is calculated using the formula involving modular exponentiation and subtraction.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The formula used ensures that Manao minimizes his score by accounting for the doubling effect efficiently.
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`) to handle large numbers without overflow.
   - The final score is taken modulo `1000000009` to fit within standard integer limits.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the function summary and the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `excess_full_sets`**:
   - The current implementation uses `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`, which is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be `excess_full_sets = (n - m) // (k - 1)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `remaining_correct_answers`**:
   - The current implementation uses `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`, which is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k + (n - m) % (k - 1)`.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The current implementation uses `score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD`, which is close but needs adjustments.

To correct these issues, the function should be revised as follows:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k + (n - m) % (k - 1)
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    
    return score
```

Given these corrections, the provided program no longer accurately implements the logic to compute the minimum possible score for Manao.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has logical errors in calculating the `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers`. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
