You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

- Program:
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It returns a score based on the following conditions:

1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is `m % MOD`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as `(n - m) // k` and `remaining_correct_answers` as `(n - m) % k`. The score is then calculated as `(m % MOD) - excess_full_sets + remaining_correct_answers`.

This function handles all edge cases where the conditions for the score calculation are met. It ensures that the score is computed correctly based on the given inputs and the specified rules.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the scenario where the number of full sets of consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) might be less than the number of required full sets to achieve the minimum score.

Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this issue:

### Case Analysis:
Consider the input `n = 7`, `m = 4`, `k = 2`.

- The maximum number of full sets of consecutive correct answers is `m // k = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- The remaining correct answers after accounting for full sets is `m % k = 4 % 2 = 0`.

However, to achieve the minimum score, we need to ensure that the remaining correct answers are maximized while minimizing the number of full sets. In this case, the optimal strategy is to place the correct answers in such a way that we maximize the number of full sets before placing the last correct answer.

### Expected Behavior:
- If we place the correct answers in positions 1, 2, 5, and 7, we get 2 full sets (1-2 and 5-6) and 1 additional correct answer (position 7).
- This results in a score of `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`, because each full set doubles the score, and the final correct answer adds 1 point.

### Program Output:
- The program calculates the score as follows:
  - `max_full_sets = 2`
  - `remaining_correct = 0`
  - Since `m > n - n // k` is not true, it enters the else block.
  - `excess_full_sets = 2 - (7 - 4) // (2 - 1) = 2 - 3 = -1` (which is incorrect logic)
  - `remaining_correct_answers = 4 - (-1) * 2 = 6` (which is incorrect)
  - The final score calculation is incorrect due to the negative value for `excess_full_sets`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of full sets is less than the number of required full sets to achieve the minimum score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
