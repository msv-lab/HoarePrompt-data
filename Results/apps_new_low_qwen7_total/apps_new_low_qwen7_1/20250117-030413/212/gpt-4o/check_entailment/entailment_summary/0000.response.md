Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1` appears to handle the conditions outlined in the problem statement.
2. The logic in `func_1` is designed to account for different scenarios based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. Specifically, the function checks whether the number of correct answers (`m`) is less than or equal to a certain threshold (`n - n // k`). If so, it directly computes the score as `m % MOD`.
4. If `m` exceeds this threshold, the function calculates the number of full sets of consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) and any remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct`).
5. The function then computes the score using modular arithmetic to ensure it remains within the bounds of `10^9 + 9`.

However, there is a discrepancy between the logic in the provided code and the execution summary. The execution summary suggests that the score should be adjusted by subtracting `excess_full_sets` and adding `remaining_correct_answers`, but the actual implementation uses a different formula involving powers of 2. 

Let's verify the logic step-by-step:
- The number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers is `max_full_sets = m // k`.
- The remaining correct answers after accounting for these full sets is `remaining_correct = m % k`.
- The score is calculated as `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (2^excess_full_sets - 1) * 2^(MOD - 2)) % MOD`.

Given the execution summary's explanation, the formula seems more aligned with doubling the score after every `k` correct answers. This aligns with the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Therefore, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
