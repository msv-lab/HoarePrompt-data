Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating Manao's minimum possible score in a quiz based on the rules provided. The key points are how scoring works with consecutive correct answers and how the score doubles after reaching a specific count.
2. **Program Structure**: 
   - The program reads inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user.
   - It calls the function `func_1(n, m, k)` to compute the score.
   - The function `func_1` performs the necessary calculations to find the minimum score based on the given constraints.
3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization and Input Validation**: The function correctly initializes variables and checks the input constraints.
   - **Full Sets Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the maximum number of full sets of consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets = m // k`).
   - **Remaining Correct Answers**: The code correctly calculates the remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct = m % k`).
   - **Conditional Scoring**:
     - If `m <= n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
     - Otherwise, the function calculates the number of additional full sets (`excess_full_sets`) and the remaining correct answers (`remaining_correct_answers`), and then computes the score accordingly.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modular arithmetic (`pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)`) is correct for handling large numbers and ensuring results fit within the specified modulo constraint.

Given the detailed analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement and correctly implements the scoring mechanism based on the provided rules. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the given annotated program.

Correctness: **True**
