Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine the final output state:

Initial State:
- `max_full_sets = m // k`
- `remaining_correct = m % k`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq n\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\)
- `m` is greater than \(n - n // k\)

Given code:
```python
excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Calculate `excess_full_sets`:**
   - `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`
   - Here, `max_full_sets = m // k` and `(n - m) // (k - 1)` calculates how many full sets can be formed from the remaining elements after forming `max_full_sets`.

2. **Calculate `remaining_correct_answers`:**
   - `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`
   - This calculates the number of correct answers left after accounting for the excess full sets.

3. **Calculate `score`:**
   - `score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD`
   - This computes the score using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

### Final Output State:

After running the code, the following variables are updated:
- `excess_full_sets`: Calculated based on the initial values of `max_full_sets`, `n`, and `m`.
- `remaining_correct_answers`: Updated based on the value of `excess_full_sets`.
- `score`: Calculated using the updated `remaining_correct_answers` and `excess_full_sets`.

The initial values of `max_full_sets` and `remaining_correct` remain unchanged. The final state includes the new values of `excess_full_sets`, `remaining_correct_answers`, and `score`.

Output State: **max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k, excess_full_sets is calculated, remaining_correct_answers is calculated, score is calculated, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ n, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and m is greater than n - n // k**
