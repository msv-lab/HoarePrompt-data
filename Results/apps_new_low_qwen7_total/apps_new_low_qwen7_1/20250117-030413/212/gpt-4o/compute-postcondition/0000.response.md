Initial State: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.

Code Block:
```
max_full_sets = m // k
remaining_correct = m % k
```

Analysis:
- The first line calculates the integer division of `m` by `k` and assigns the result to `max_full_sets`.
- The second line calculates the remainder when `m` is divided by `k` and assigns the result to `remaining_correct`.

Final State Calculation:
- `max_full_sets` is the result of `m // k`.
- `remaining_correct` is the result of `m % k`.

Output State: **max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ n, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n**
