The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. All three parameters are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n. The function returns a score calculated based on the following conditions:

- If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then the score is `m % MOD`.
- Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as `(n - m) // k` and `remaining_correct_answers` as `(n - m) % k`, and the score is `(m % MOD) - excess_full_sets + remaining_correct_answers`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and return a score based on the specified conditions.
