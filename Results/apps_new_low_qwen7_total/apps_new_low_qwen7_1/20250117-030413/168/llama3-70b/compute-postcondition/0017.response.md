The code `print('-')` prints a dash character to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `ans` is a list containing all characters of `a` that also appear in `b` in order, the length of `ans` is 0**
