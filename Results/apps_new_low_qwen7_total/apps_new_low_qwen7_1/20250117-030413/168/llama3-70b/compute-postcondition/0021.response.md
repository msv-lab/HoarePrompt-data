The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two strings `a` and `b`, both consisting of lowercase letters and of maximum length \(10^5\), but without specifying the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both are strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\), and returns nothing.**
