The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is 3. The values of `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string with length greater than 2, `b` is a string with length greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is either 1 or 0**
