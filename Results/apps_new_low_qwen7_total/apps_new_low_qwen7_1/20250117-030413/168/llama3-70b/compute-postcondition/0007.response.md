Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the conditions `i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)`.
2. **Determine which states can be adjusted**: The states that can be adjusted are those related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a string
- `b` is a string
- `i` is 1
- `j` is either 1 or 0

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)` must be true.

- Since `i` is currently 1, for `i < len(a)` to be true, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- Since `j` is either 1 or 0, for `j < len(b)` to be true, `len(b)` must be greater than 0 (since 1 and 0 are both valid values for `j` and both are less than any positive integer).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `len(a)` and `len(b)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1, `j` is either 1 or 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, and `len(b)` must be greater than 0**
