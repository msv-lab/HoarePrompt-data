Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and j < len(b)`.
2. **Determine the Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `i`, `j`, `len(a)`, and `len(b)`.
3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `a` is a string.
   - `b` is a string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions `i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. Therefore, both conditions are already true because `0 < len(a)` and `0 < len(b)` as long as `a` and `b` are non-empty strings.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, and the loop condition is `i < len(a) and j < len(b)`, the loop will execute the first time as long as `a` and `b` are non-empty strings.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
