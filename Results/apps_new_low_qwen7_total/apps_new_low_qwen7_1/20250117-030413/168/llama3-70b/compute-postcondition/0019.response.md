The code `print(''.join(ans))` does not change any of the variables' values. Instead, it prints the concatenated string of the list `ans`. Since `ans` is a list containing all characters of `a` that also appear in `b` in order, and its length is greater than 0, the output will be the concatenation of these common characters.

The output state remains the same as the initial state except for the action of printing the concatenated string. The printed value will be `ans` joined into a single string, which is the characters from `a` that are also in `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list containing all characters of `a` that also appear in `b` in order; the string `ans` is printed.**
