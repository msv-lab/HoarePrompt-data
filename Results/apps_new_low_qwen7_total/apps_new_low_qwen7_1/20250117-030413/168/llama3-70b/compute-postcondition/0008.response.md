Output State: **a is a string, b is a string, i is 2, j is 2, ans is a list containing the character at index 1 of string a** 

Explanation:
- The first line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so it appends the character at index 1 of `a` to `ans`.
- The second line `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
- The third line `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1, making `j` equal to 2.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `ans` were not modified by these lines, so their states remain as per the initial state, with `a` being a string, `b` being a string, and `ans` being an empty list initially. After appending the character at index 1 of `a`, `ans` now contains that character.
