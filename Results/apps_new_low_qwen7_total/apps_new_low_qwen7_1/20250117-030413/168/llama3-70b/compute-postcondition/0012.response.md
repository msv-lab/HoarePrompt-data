The initial state is as follows:
- `a` is a string with a length greater than 2
- `b` is a string with a length greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `j` is either 1 or 0

The code block is:
```
ans.append(a[i])
i += 1
j += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. `ans.append(a[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` in the string `a` to the list `ans`. At this point, `i` is 2, so `ans` will receive the character at index 2 of `a`.
2. `i += 1`: This increments `i` by 1, so `i` now becomes 3.
3. `j += 1`: This increments `j` by 1. If `j` was initially 1, it becomes 2; if `j` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

Since `a` is a string with a length greater than 2, we know that `a[2]` exists and is a valid character. Let's denote this character as `char_a`.

After running the code block:
- `ans` will contain `a[2]`.
- `i` will be 3.
- `j` will be either 2 (if originally 1) or 1 (if originally 0).
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **a is a string with length greater than 2, b is a string with length greater than 0, ans is [char_a], i is 3, j is either 2 or 1**
