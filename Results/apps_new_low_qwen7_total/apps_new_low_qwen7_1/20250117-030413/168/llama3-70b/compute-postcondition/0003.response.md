Output State: **a is a string, b is a string, i is 1, j is 1, ans is [a[0]]**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `a` as a string, `b` as a string, `i` as 0, and `j` as 0. It also mentions that the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`.
- The first line of code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 0, it appends `a[0]` to `ans`.
- The second line of code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1, changing it from 0 to 1.
- The third line of code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1, changing it from 0 to 1.
- Therefore, after executing the entire block of code, `a` and `b` remain strings, `i` is now 1, `j` is now 1, and `ans` contains the character `a[0]`.
