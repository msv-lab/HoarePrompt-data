The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `a[i]` is not equal to `b[j]`, and the only change is in `i`, the condition for `a[i]` not being equal to `b[j]` still holds true. The values of `a`, `b`, `j`, and the initial condition for `a[i]` not equal to `b[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `a[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`**
