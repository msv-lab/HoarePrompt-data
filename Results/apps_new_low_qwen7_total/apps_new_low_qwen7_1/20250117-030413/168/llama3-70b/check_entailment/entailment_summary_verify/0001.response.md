Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly describes the logic of the program. It iterates through both strings `a` and `b`, appending matching characters from `a` to `ans`.
   - The function handles the edge case where `ans` is empty by printing `-`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The program initializes pointers `i` and `j` to traverse strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and an empty list `ans`.
   - **Iteration and Matching**: The while loop correctly iterates through both strings. When a character from `a` matches a character from `b`, it appends the character from `a` to `ans` and increments both `i` and `j`. When there is a mismatch, it only increments `i`.
   - **Output**: After the loop, the program checks if `ans` is empty and prints the appropriate message.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly constructs a subsequence of `a` that matches `b` in order.
   - The function does not explicitly handle the removal of consecutive characters from `b`, but it does find the longest possible subsequence of `a` that can be matched to `b`.
   - The edge case of an empty `ans` is correctly handled by printing `-`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` or `b` is empty, as `ans` would be empty, leading to the printing of `-`.
   - The program does not handle non-alphabetical characters, but since the problem specifies that both strings consist of lowercase letters, this is not an issue here.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment accurately describes the behavior of the program and its correctness in solving the given problem.

Final: **True**
