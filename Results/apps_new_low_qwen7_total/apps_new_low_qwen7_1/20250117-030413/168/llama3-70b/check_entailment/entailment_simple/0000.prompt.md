Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two strings a and b. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string b in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string a. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from b and make it empty.

Subsequence of string s is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string s.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

On the first line output a subsequence of string a, obtained from b by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).


-----Examples-----
Input
hi
bob

Output
-

Input
abca
accepted

Output
ac

Input
abacaba
abcdcba

Output
abcba



-----Note-----

In the first example strings a and b don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.

In the second example ac is a subsequence of a, and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string b.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, with lengths no bigger than 10^5.
def func():
    a = input()

b = input()

i = 0

j = 0

ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list containing all characters of `a` that also appear in `b` in order.
    if (len(ans) == 0) :
        print('-')
    else :
        print(''.join(ans))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list containing all characters of `a` that also appear in `b` in order. If `ans` is an empty list, no action is taken. Otherwise, the list `ans` is printed.
