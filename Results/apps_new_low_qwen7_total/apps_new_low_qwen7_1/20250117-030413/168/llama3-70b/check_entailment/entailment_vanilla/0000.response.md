Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through both strings `a` and `b` and constructing a new list `ans` which contains characters from `a` that also appear in `b` in order. The program then checks if the resulting list `ans` is empty and prints an appropriate message based on its size.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes pointers `i` and `j` to traverse strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also initializes an empty list `ans`.

2. **Iteration and Matching**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - If the current character of `a` matches the current character of `b`, it appends the character from `a` to `ans` and increments both `i` and `j`.
   - If the characters do not match, it only increments `i`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `ans` is empty. If it is, it prints `-`. Otherwise, it joins the list `ans` into a string and prints it.

This approach ensures that the characters in `ans` are a subsequence of `a` and correspond to the characters in `b` in order. The program does not attempt to remove consecutive characters but rather constructs a subsequence of `a` that matches `b`.

Given this logic aligns with the problem statement, the program correctly finds the longest subsequence of `a` that can be formed using characters from `b` without removing consecutive characters.

Correctness: **True**
