Reasoning:
- The given function correctly iterates through both strings `a` and `b`, checking for matching characters.
- When a match is found, the character is added to the `ans` list, and both indices `i` and `j` are incremented.
- If no matches are found (i.e., `ans` remains empty), the function correctly prints `-`.
- If matches are found, the function concatenates them into a single string and prints it.
- The function handles the general case where both strings consist solely of lowercase English alphabetic characters.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where either `a` or `b` is empty, but since the problem description guarantees that both strings are non-empty, this is not a concern here.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and correctly implements the logic to find the longest subsequence of `a` that can be formed from `b` by removing the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b`.

Correctness: **True**
