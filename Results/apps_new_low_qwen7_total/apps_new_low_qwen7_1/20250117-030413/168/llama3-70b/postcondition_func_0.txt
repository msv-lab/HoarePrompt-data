The function `func()` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input, both consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet with lengths no greater than \(10^5\). It then iterates through both strings, comparing each character of `a` with each character of `b`. If a character from `a` matches a character from `b`, it appends that character to the list `ans`. After the loop, if `ans` is empty, it prints a hyphen (`-`). Otherwise, it prints the concatenated string formed by joining all elements of `ans`. The function does not return anything.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `ans` will remain an empty list. Therefore, a hyphen (`-`) will be printed in this case.
- The function does not handle non-alphabetical characters or special characters in the input strings. It assumes that both `a` and `b` contain only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
- The function does not account for the possibility that the same character might appear multiple times in both strings; it only checks for matching characters once per position in `a` and `b`.
