### Reasoning:

To systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's break down the analysis into detailed steps, focusing on each function and their interactions.

1. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of `a1` and `a2`.
   - It also finds the coefficients `x0` and `y0` for the linear combination `a1 * x + a2 * y = GCD(a1, a2)`.
   - These values are then scaled by `C // GCD(a1, a2)` to solve the equation `a1 * x + a2 * y = C` where `C = b2 - b1`.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`):**
   - It initializes the coefficients `A = a1`, `B = -a2`, and `C = b2 - b1`.
   - The GCD of `A` and `B` is calculated using `func_1`.
   - If `C` is not divisible by the GCD, it immediately returns `-1` indicating no solution exists.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `x0` and `y0` to ensure they are valid solutions to the equation `a1 * x + a2 * y = C`.
   - It then ensures the signs of `x0` and `y0` are consistent with the signs of `a1` and `a2` to avoid negative values when necessary.
   - The function uses `adjust_solution` to further refine `x0` and `y0` to stay within the range `[L, R]`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `x0` and counts how many `val = a1 * x0 + b1` fall within the range `[L, R]`.

3. **Adjust Solution Function (`adjust_solution`):**
   - This function adjusts the solution `(x, y)` to ensure the value `val = a1 * x + b1` stays within the range `[L, R]`.
   - It handles both positive and negative steps for `a1` and `a2` by computing appropriate adjustments `k` based on the current value of `val` relative to `L` and `R`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **GCD Calculation:**
  - The `func_1` function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm and computes the coefficients `x0` and `y0` such that `a1 * x0 + a2 * y0 = GCD(a1, a2)`.
  - Scaling these coefficients by `C // GCD(a1, a2)` to solve `a1 * x + a2 * y = C` is mathematically sound.

- **Main Function:**
  - The logic in `func_2` ensures that `x0` and `y0` are adjusted correctly to satisfy the equation `a1 * x + a2 * y = C`.
  - The use of `adjust_solution` ensures that the solution remains within the specified range `[L, R]`.
  - The iteration in the while loop correctly counts the number of valid `val` values within the range `[L, R]`.

- **Adjust Solution Function:**
  - The `adjust_solution` function handles edge cases where `val` might fall outside the range `[L, R]` by adjusting `x0` and `y0` appropriately.
  - The logic ensures that the solution is refined to stay within the bounds `[L, R]`.

### Key Points:
- The program correctly handles the GCD calculation and solving the linear Diophantine equation.
- The adjustment function ensures that the solution stays within the specified range.
- The main loop correctly iterates over possible values and counts the valid solutions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `x` within the range `[L, R]` that satisfy the given arithmetic progressions. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies identified.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
