### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - This function correctly calculates the GCD of `a1` and `a2` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It also finds integer solutions `(x0, y0)` for the equation `A * x + B * y = C` where `A = a1`, `B = -a2`, and `C = b2 - b1`.
   - The returned values are adjusted to ensure they satisfy the equation modulo the GCD.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`):**
   - It sets up the system of equations with coefficients `A = a1`, `B = -a2`, and `C = b2 - b1`.
   - If `C` is not divisible by the GCD of `A` and `B`, there are no solutions, and it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `x0` and `y0` to find the smallest positive solution.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `x0` and checks if the resulting `val` falls within the range `[L, R]`.

3. **Adjust Solution Function (`adjust_solution`):**
   - This function adjusts the solution `(x, y)` to ensure the value `val = a1 * x + b1` stays within the range `[L, R]`.
   - It handles both positive and negative steps for `a1` and `a2`.

### Key Points:
- The logic for calculating the GCD and finding integer solutions seems correct.
- The adjustment function (`adjust_solution`) ensures that the solution stays within the specified range.
- The main loop in `func_2` correctly increments `x0` and `y0` to find all valid solutions within the range `[L, R]`.

Given that the problem description and the functions appear to be implemented correctly, the program should work as expected under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
