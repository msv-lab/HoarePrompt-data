Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is intended to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the GCD of two numbers and their coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect. It fails to properly handle the recursive case and the calculation of `x` and `y`. This means it doesn't correctly return the GCD and the coefficients for the specific arithmetic progression problem.
   - For example, the function doesn't return any values for `x` and `y` when `a` is not zero, which are crucial for solving the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to solve the linear Diophantine equation derived from the arithmetic progressions.
   - It correctly checks if `C` is divisible by `gcd` and returns `-1` if not, ensuring that there is a solution.
   - It then uses the coefficients `x0` and `y0` to generate solutions to the equation.
   - The `while` loop iterates over possible values of `x0` and `y0` to count how many integers fall within the range `[L, R]`.
   - The use of `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` helps in scaling the solutions appropriately.
   - The `adjust_solution` function is called to ensure that the generated solutions are within the required bounds.

3. **Function 3 (`adjust_solution`)**:
   - This function adjusts the values of `x` and `y` to ensure that `val = a1 * x + b1` is within the range `[L, R]`.
   - It handles both positive and negative values of `sign_a1` and ensures that the solutions are scaled correctly.

Given the above analysis, the primary issue lies with `func_1`, which is supposed to provide the necessary coefficients for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm but fails to do so correctly. This makes the entire solution invalid since the subsequent functions rely on incorrect initial values.

Correctness: **False**
