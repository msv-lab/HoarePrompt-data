### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Calling `func_2`:**
   - The program reads the input and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The function `func_2` computes the number of integers \( x \) within the specified range \([L, R]\) that satisfy the equation \( x = a_1 k' + b_1 = a_2 l' + b_2 \).

2. **Helper Functions Analysis:**

   - **`func_1(a, b):`**
     - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - It also finds the coefficients `x` and `y` such that \( a x + b y = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
     - The function uses recursion to compute the GCD and Bézout's coefficients.

   - **`func_2(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R):`**
     - This function uses `func_1` to find the GCD of the coefficients `a1` and `-a2` and the corresponding Bézout's coefficients.
     - It checks if `b2 - b1` is divisible by the GCD. If not, it returns -1 (which should not happen since the problem guarantees that the GCD will divide `b2 - b1`).
     - It adjusts the coefficients using `adjust_solution` to find the smallest solution.
     - It then iterates over possible values of \( x \) and counts how many of them fall within the range \([L, R]\).

   - **`adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2):`**
     - This function adjusts the solution to ensure that the value of \( x \) and \( y \) are within the required range.
     - It ensures that the computed solution satisfies the linear Diophantine equation and adjusts \( x \) and \( y \) accordingly.

3. **Overall Flow:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and uses the appropriate mathematical techniques to solve the problem.
   - The GCD and Bézout's coefficients are calculated correctly, and the range of solutions is checked appropriately.
   - The adjustment function ensures that the computed solution fits within the specified range \([L, R]\).

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers \( x \) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.
