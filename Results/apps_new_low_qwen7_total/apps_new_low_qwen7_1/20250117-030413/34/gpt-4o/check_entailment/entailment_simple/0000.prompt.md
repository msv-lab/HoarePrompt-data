Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two arithmetic progressions: a_1k + b_1 and a_2l + b_2. Find the number of integers x such that L ≤ x ≤ R and x = a_1k' + b_1 = a_2l' + b_2, for some integers k', l' ≥ 0.
