### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the given problem description and the annotated version.

1. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `a1` and `a2`.
   - It also finds integer solutions `(x0, y0)` for the equation `A * x + B * y = C` where `A = a1`, `B = -a2`, and `C = b2 - b1`.
   - The returned values are adjusted to ensure they satisfy the equation modulo the GCD.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`):**
   - It sets up the system of equations with coefficients `A = a1`, `B = -a2`, and `C = b2 - b1`.
   - If `C` is not divisible by the GCD of `A` and `B`, there are no solutions, and it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `x0` and `y0` to find the smallest positive solution.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `x0` and checks if the resulting `val` falls within the range `[L, R]`.
   - The function correctly adjusts the solution `(x0, y0)` using the `adjust_solution` function to ensure the value `val = a1 * x0 + b1` stays within the range `[L, R]`.

3. **Adjust Solution Function (`adjust_solution`):**
   - This function adjusts the solution `(x, y)` to ensure the value `val = a1 * x + b1` stays within the specified range `[L, R]`.
   - It handles both positive and negative steps for `a1` and `a2`.

### Key Points:
- The logic for calculating the GCD and finding integer solutions seems correct.
- The adjustment function (`adjust_solution`) ensures that the solution stays within the specified range.
- The main loop in `func_2` correctly increments `x0` and `y0` to find all valid solutions within the range `[L, R]`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Validation:** The program assumes valid inputs, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem constraints.
- **GCD Calculation:** The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD and finds the coefficients `(x0, y0)` for the linear Diophantine equation.
- **Solutions Adjustment:** The `adjust_solution` function ensures that the solutions `(x0, y0)` are adjusted to stay within the range `[L, R]`.
- **Range Check:** The main loop in `func_2` correctly checks if the values fall within the specified range `[L, R]` and counts the number of valid solutions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `x` such that `L ≤ x ≤ R` and `x = a1k' + b1 = a2l' + b2` for some integers `k', l' ≥ 0`. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `adjust_solution` work together to achieve this goal without any logical errors or omissions.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
