### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of integers \( x \) in the range \([L, R]\) such that \( x \) belongs to both arithmetic progressions defined by \( a_1k + b_1 \) and \( a_2l + b_2 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, the function does not use the optional parameters `a_2`, `b_2`, `L`, and `R`, which suggests these parameters are currently unused. The function correctly computes the GCD and related coefficients when called properly.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to solve the linear Diophantine equation \( a_1x - a_2y = b_2 - b_1 \). It checks if the right-hand side is divisible by the GCD. If so, it finds the initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\) and iteratively checks for solutions within the range \([L, R]\).
   - **Function `adjust_solution`**: This function adjusts the solution \((x, y)\) to ensure that the value \( a_1x + b_1 \) remains within the range \([L, R]\).

3. **Key Steps in `func_2`**:
   - Compute the GCD and related coefficients.
   - Check divisibility condition.
   - Adjust initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\).
   - Iterate to find valid \( x \) values within the range \([L, R]\).

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The GCD computation ensures that the solutions are valid within the range.
   - The iterative check ensures that each \( x \) value is counted exactly once.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The implementation seems robust and handles the necessary calculations and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
