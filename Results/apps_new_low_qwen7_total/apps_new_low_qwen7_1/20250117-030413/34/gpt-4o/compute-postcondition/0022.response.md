The code snippet `val = a1 * x0 + b1` assigns the value of `a1 * x0 + b1` to `val`. Given the initial state, the values of `a1`, `x0`, and `b1` remain unchanged. The other variables (`a2`, `b2`, `L`, `R`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `gcd`, `x0`, `y0`, and `count`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a1` is a1, `a2` is a2, `b1` is b1, `b2` is b2, `L` is L, `R` is R, `A` is non-negative, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative, `C` is b2 - b1, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is x0, `y0` is y0, `val` is a1 * x0 + b1, `count` is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, no changes otherwise**
