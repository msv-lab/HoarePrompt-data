Output State: **a1 is a1, a2 is a2, b1 is b1, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, A is non-negative, B is either less than 0 or non-negative, C is b2 - b1, gcd is unchanged, x0 is x0 + a2_div_gcd, y0 is y0 - a1_div_gcd, val is a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1, count is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, and no changes otherwise.**

Explanation: 
- The first line `x0 += a2_div_gcd` updates the value of `x0` by adding `a2_div_gcd` to it.
- The second line `y0 -= a1_div_gcd` updates the value of `y0` by subtracting `a1_div_gcd` from it.
- The value of `val` is recalculated as `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1`.
- The value of `count` is increased by 1 if `L <= val <= R`, and no changes otherwise.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition and the provided code block.
