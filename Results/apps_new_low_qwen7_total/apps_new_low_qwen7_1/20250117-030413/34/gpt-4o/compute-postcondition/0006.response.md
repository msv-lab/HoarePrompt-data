Output State: **x is updated to its original value plus a2_div_gcd, y is updated to its original value minus a1_div_gcd, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2, L, R, and b1 remain unchanged**

Explanation: The provided code block consists of two lines. The first line updates `x` by adding `a2_div_gcd` to its current value, and the second line updates `y` by subtracting `a1_div_gcd` from its current value. No other variables (`a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, `L`, `R`, and `b1`) are affected by these operations.
