The `while True` loop does not depend on any specific condition outside the loop itself. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any of the states provided, as the loop will always execute another iteration.

However, since the loop head does not contain any specific conditions to check, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we do not need to make any changes to the states listed.

State: **`a1` is a1, `a2` is a2, `b1` is b1, `b2` is b2, `L` is L, `R` is R, `A` is non-negative, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative, `C` is b2 - b1, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is x0 + a2_div_gcd, `y0` is y0 - a1_div_gcd, `val` is a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1, `count` is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, no changes otherwise**
