You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, b1, a2, b2, L, and R are integers where 0 < a1, a2 ≤ 2·10^9, -2·10^9 ≤ b1, b2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9, and L ≤ R.
def func_2(a1, b1, a2, b2, L, R):
    A = a1

B = -a2

C = b2 - b1

gcd, x0, y0 = func_1(abs(A), abs(B))
    if (C % gcd != 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a1 is a1, a2 is a2, b1 is b1, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, A is a1, B is -a2, C is b2 - b1, gcd is unknown, x0 is unknown, y0 is unknown, and (C % gcd == 0)
    x0 *= C // gcd

y0 *= C // gcd
    if (A < 0) :
        x0 = -x0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a1 is a1, a2 is a2, b1 is b1, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, if A is less than 0, then A is negated, B remains -a2, C remains b2 - b1, gcd remains unknown, x0 is the negation of its original value, and (C % gcd == 0). Otherwise, the state of the variables does not change.
    if (B < 0) :
        y0 = -y0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a1` is a1, `a2` is a2, `b1` is b1, `b2` is b2, `L` is L, `R` is R, `A` is negated if it was less than 0, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative depending on the initial state, `C` is b2 - b1, `gcd` remains unknown, `x0` is the negation of its original value, and `y0` is the original value of `y0`.
    a1_div_gcd = a1 // gcd

a2_div_gcd = a2 // gcd

x0, y0 = adjust_solution(x0, y0, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, 1, -1)

count = 0
    while True:
        val = a1 * x0 + b1
        
        if val > R:
            break
        
        if L <= val <= R:
            count += 1
        
        x0 += a2_div_gcd
        
        y0 -= a1_div_gcd
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a1 is a1, a2 is a2, b1 is b1, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, A is non-negative, B is either less than 0 or non-negative, C is b2 - b1, gcd is unchanged, x0 is x0 + (number_of_iterations * a2_div_gcd), y0 is y0 - (number_of_iterations * a1_div_gcd), val is a1 * (x0 + (number_of_iterations * a2_div_gcd)) + b1, count is the total number of times the condition L <= val <= R was satisfied.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is the total number of times the condition L <= val <= R was satisfied
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts six parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. These parameters are integers where 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9, -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2`, `L`, `R` ≤ 2·10^9, and `L` ≤ `R`.
#
#The function has two possible return values:
#- Case_1: The function returns -1.
#- Case_2: The function returns `count`, which is the total number of times the condition `L <= val <= R` was satisfied.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept six integer parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`, and based on some internal logic, either return -1 or the count of how many times a value within the range `[L, R]` satisfies certain conditions derived from `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns count, which is the total number of times the condition L <= val <= R was satisfied


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
