The code updates the value of `val` to `a1 * x0 + b1`. According to the initial state, `x0` is `x0 + a2_div_gcd` and `val` was previously `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1`.

Let's substitute the updated `x0` into the expression for `val`:

1. Initial `val`: `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1`
2. Updated `val`: `a1 * x0 + b1`

Since `x0` is updated to `x0 + a2_div_gcd`, substituting this in gives us:

`val` is now `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1` simplified to `a1 * x0 + a1 * a2_div_gcd + b1`.

But the code directly sets `val` to `a1 * x0 + b1`, which means the previous term `a1 * a2_div_gcd + b1` is discarded.

So, the new value of `val` is `a1 * x0 + b1`.

Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a1` is a1, `a2` is a2, `b1` is b1, `b2` is b2, `L` is L, `R` is R, `A` is non-negative, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative, `C` is b2 - b1, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is x0 + a2_div_gcd, `y0` is y0 - a1_div_gcd, `val` is a1 * x0 + b1, `count` is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, and no changes otherwise.**
