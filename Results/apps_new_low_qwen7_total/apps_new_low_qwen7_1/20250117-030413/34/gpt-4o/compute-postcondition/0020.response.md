Output State: **a1 is a1, a2 is a2, b1 is b1, b2 is b2, L is L, R is R, A is non-negative, B is either less than 0 or non-negative, C is b2 - b1, gcd is unchanged, x0 is x0 + a2_div_gcd, y0 is y0 - a1_div_gcd, val is a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1, count is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, no changes otherwise**

Explanation:
1. The first line `x0 += a2_div_gcd` updates the value of `x0` by adding `a2_div_gcd` to it. Here, `a2_div_gcd` is derived from the division of `a2` by `gcd`.
2. The second line `y0 -= a1_div_gcd` updates the value of `y0` by subtracting `a1_div_gcd` from it. Here, `a1_div_gcd` is derived from the division of `a1` by `gcd`.

After these operations, the value of `x0` is updated to `x0 + a2_div_gcd`, and the value of `y0` is updated to `y0 - a1_div_gcd`.

Next, the value of `val` is recalculated using the new values of `x0` and `y0`:
\[ \text{val} = a1 \times (x0 + a2\_div\_gcd) + b1 \]

If this new `val` falls within the range `[L, R]`, the `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count`. 

Since the problem statement specifies that if `L <= val <= R`, `count` is increased by 1, and no other variables are modified, the final output state includes the updated `x0` and `y0` values, the potentially updated `val`, and the possibly incremented `count`.
