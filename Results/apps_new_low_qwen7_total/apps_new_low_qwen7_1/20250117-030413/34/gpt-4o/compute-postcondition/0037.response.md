The function `func_2` accepts six parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. These parameters are integers where 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9, -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2`, `L`, `R` ≤ 2·10^9, and `L` ≤ `R`.

The function has two possible return values:
- Case_1: The function returns -1.
- Case_2: The function returns `count`, which is the total number of times the condition `L <= val <= R` was satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept six integer parameters `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`, and based on some internal logic, either return -1 or the count of how many times a value within the range `[L, R]` satisfies certain conditions derived from `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2`.
