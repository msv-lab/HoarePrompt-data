Given the initial state and the provided code block, let's analyze the effects of each line on the variables.

Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers
- `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` are positive integers
- `sign_a1` and `sign_a2` are either 1 or -1 (with `sign_a1` being less than or equal to 0)
- `L` and `R` are integers such that `L â‰¤ R`

Code Block:
```python
k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)
x += k * a2_div_gcd
y -= k * a1_div_gcd
```

Let's break down the effects of these lines:

1. `k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`:
   - `k` is calculated using the formula `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`.
   - `b1` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be treated as a constant or a previously defined variable in the context of this code block.
   - This line does not modify `x` or `y` directly; it only calculates `k`.

2. `x += k * a2_div_gcd`:
   - `x` is incremented by `k * a2_div_gcd`.
   - The value of `x` is updated based on the previously calculated `k`.

3. `y -= k * a1_div_gcd`:
   - `y` is decremented by `k * a1_div_gcd`.
   - The value of `y` is updated based on the previously calculated `k`.

Since `b1` is not defined in the initial state, we'll treat it as an unspecified constant for the purpose of calculating the final state. However, we know the following:
- `x` is updated based on `k * a2_div_gcd`.
- `y` is updated based on `-k * a1_div_gcd`.

Given that `k` is calculated from the initial values and the constants, the final state of the variables will be:
- `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`.
- `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`.

Output State: **x is updated to x + k * a2_div_gcd, y is updated to y - k * a1_div_gcd, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd remain unchanged, sign_a1 and sign_a2 remain unchanged, L and R remain unchanged, b1 remains unchanged**
