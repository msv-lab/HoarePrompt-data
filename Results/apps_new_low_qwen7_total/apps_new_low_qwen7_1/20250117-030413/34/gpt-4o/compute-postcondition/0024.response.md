Postcondition: ***`a1` is a1, `a2` is a2, `b1` is b1, `b2` is b2, `L` is L, `R` is R, `A` is non-negative, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative, `C` is b2 - b1, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is x0, `y0` is y0, `val` is a1 * x0 + b1, `count` is increased by 1 if L <= val <= R, no changes otherwise and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
