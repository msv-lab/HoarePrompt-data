Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers, `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` are positive integers, `sign_a1` is 1, `sign_a2` is either 1 or -1, `L` and `R` are integers such that `L` â‰¤ `R`. The condition `b1 + a1 * x < L` is true. If `sign_a1 > 0`, then `x` and `y` are updated accordingly, otherwise `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`, and `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, `L`, `R`, and `b1` remain unchanged.**
