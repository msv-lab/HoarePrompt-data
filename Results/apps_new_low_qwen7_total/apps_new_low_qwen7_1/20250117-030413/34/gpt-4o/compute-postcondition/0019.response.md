Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a1`, `a2` is `a2`, `b1` is `b1`, `b2` is `b2`, `L` is `L`, `R` is `R`, `A` is non-negative, `B` is either less than 0 or non-negative, `C` is `b2 - b1`, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is `-y0_original`, `val` is `a1 * (-y0_original) + b1`. If `L <= val <= R`, `count` is increased by 1. No changes are made otherwise.***
