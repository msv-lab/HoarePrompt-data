Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers. If `b1 + a1 * x < L`, then `x` is updated to `x + a2_div_gcd` and `y` is updated to `y - a1_div_gcd`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`, and `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, `L`, `R`, and `b1` remain unchanged.***
