Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts six parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. These parameters are integers where \(0 < a1, a2 \leq 2 \times 10^9\), \(-2 \times 10^9 \leq b1, b2, L, R \leq 2 \times 10^9\), and \(L \leq R\).

The function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes variables `A`, `B`, and `C` using the provided parameters.
2. Calls another function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) and the coefficients `x0` and `y0` for the linear Diophantine equation \(A \cdot x + B \cdot y = C\).
3. Checks if \(C\) is divisible by `gcd`. If not, the function returns `-1`.
4. Adjusts `x0` and `y0` based on the value of `A` and `B`.
5. Divides `a1` and `a2` by `gcd` and stores the results in `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd`, respectively.
6. Adjusts the solution `(x0, y0)` using the `adjust_solution` function.
7. Iterates through possible values of `x0` and `y0` to find how many times the expression \(val = a1 \cdot x0 + b1\) falls within the range \([L, R]\).
8. Returns the count of valid values.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `gcd` is always computed correctly and that the input values satisfy the given constraints.
- If `C % gcd` is not zero, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- The function handles negative values of `A` and `B` appropriately by adjusting `x0` and `y0`.
- The `adjust_solution` function is assumed to be defined and correctly adjusts the solution based on the given parameters.

After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows:
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged.
- `L` and `R` remain unchanged.
- `A` is adjusted to a non-negative value.
- `B` is either negative or non-negative.
- `C` is the difference between `b2` and `b1`.
- `gcd` is unchanged.
- `x0` and `y0` are adjusted based on the computation and adjustments described above.
- The function returns either `-1` or the count of valid values within the specified range.**
