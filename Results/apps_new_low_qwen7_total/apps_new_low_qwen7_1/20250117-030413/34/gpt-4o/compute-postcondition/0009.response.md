Initial State: `x` and `y` are integers. `x` is updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, `y` is updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`, and `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `sign_a2`, `L`, `R`, and `b1` remain unchanged. The condition `(b1 + a1 * x > R)` holds true.
```
x -= a2_div_gcd
y += a1_div_gcd
```

Analysis:
- The first line subtracts `a2_div_gcd` from `x`. Given that `x` was previously updated to `x + k * a2_div_gcd`, subtracting `a2_div_gcd` effectively cancels out the addition done by `k * a2_div_gcd`, leaving `x` unchanged from its original value before the initial update.
- The second line adds `a1_div_gcd` to `y`. Given that `y` was previously updated to `y - k * a1_div_gcd`, adding `a1_div_gcd` cancels out the subtraction done by `-k * a1_div_gcd`, leaving `y` unchanged from its original value before the initial update.

Since both `x` and `y` are restored to their original values from the initial conditions after the operations in the code block, the final state remains as follows:

Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer**
