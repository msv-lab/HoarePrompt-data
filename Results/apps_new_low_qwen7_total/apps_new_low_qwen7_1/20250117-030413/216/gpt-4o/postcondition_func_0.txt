The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` (consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters). It determines the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`. The function does not explicitly accept `n` and `s` as parameters; instead, it reads them from standard input. After reading `n` and `s`, the function iterates through each character in `s`. If a character is lowercase and not already in the `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`. If a character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` with the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, then resets `current_set` and `current_count`. Finally, it prints the value of `max_count`, which is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`.
