Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, s is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, char is the next character in the string s, max_count is 1, current_set is a set containing {char}, current_count is 1**

Explanation: The first line adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`, which means `current_set` now contains the character `char`. The second line increments `current_count` by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The variables `n`, `s`, and `max_count` (which was initially 0) remain unchanged from their initial states.
