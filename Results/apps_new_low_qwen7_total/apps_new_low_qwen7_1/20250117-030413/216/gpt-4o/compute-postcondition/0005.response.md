Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is a set containing the character `char`, `current_count` is 1, and the current character being processed (`char`) is lowercase. These states hold if `char` is not already in `current_set`. Otherwise, the states remain as initially defined before the if-else block executes.***
