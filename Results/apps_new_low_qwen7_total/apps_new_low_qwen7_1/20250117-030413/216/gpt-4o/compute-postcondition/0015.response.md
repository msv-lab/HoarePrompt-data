Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`

Code Block:
```
current_set.add(char)
current_count += 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`.
- The second line `current_count += 1` increments the integer `current_count` by 1.

Since no initial values for `current_set` and `current_count` are provided, we assume they start as empty (for `current_set`) and 0 (for `current_count`).

Final Output State: **current_set is {char}, current_count is 1**
