Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, the state remains unchanged.***
