Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is a set containing `{char}`, and `current_count` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` remain unchanged.***
