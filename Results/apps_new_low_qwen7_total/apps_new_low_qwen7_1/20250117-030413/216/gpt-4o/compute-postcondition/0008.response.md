Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If the current character (`char`) is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is a set containing the character `char`, and `current_count` is 1. Otherwise, `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` remain as initially defined (i.e., `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set(), and `current_count` is 0).***
