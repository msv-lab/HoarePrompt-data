The given code snippet reads two inputs from the user: an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then initializes three variables: `max_count` to 0, `current_set` to an empty set, and `current_count` to 0. However, the actual logic to process these inputs and update the variables is not present in the provided code snippet (i.e., there are no further operations or conditions applied to these variables).

Given this, the variables remain in their initialized states after reading the inputs, and no further changes are made to them. Therefore, the final state remains as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, max_count is 0, current_set is a set(), current_count is 0**
