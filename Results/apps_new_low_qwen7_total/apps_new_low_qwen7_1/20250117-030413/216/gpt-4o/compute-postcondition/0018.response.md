Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`. If `char` is lowercase and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is 1. If `char` is lowercase and already in `current_set`, the state remains unchanged. If `char` is not lowercase, `current_set` is an empty set and `current_count` is 0.**
