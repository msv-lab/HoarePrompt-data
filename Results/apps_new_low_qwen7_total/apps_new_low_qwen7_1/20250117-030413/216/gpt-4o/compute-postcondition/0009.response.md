Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `char`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\).
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
   - `char` is the current character being processed in the string `s`.
   - `max_count` is 1 if the current character (`char`) is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, otherwise it remains 0.
   - `current_set` is a set containing the character `char` if it is a new character, otherwise it remains as initially defined (an empty set).
   - `current_count` is 1 if the current character (`char`) is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, otherwise it remains 0.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - Since `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are reset to their initial values at the beginning of each iteration (i.e., `max_count = 0`, `current_set = set()`, and `current_count = 0`), these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `char`, which will now be the next character in the string `s`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set(), and `current_count` is 0**.
