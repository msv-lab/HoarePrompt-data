Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem correctly by maintaining a set of unique lowercase characters and counting them while iterating through the string. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. The program uses `current_count` to track the count of consecutive unique lowercase characters, but it does not ensure that there are no uppercase letters between these lowercase characters.
2. When encountering an uppercase letter, the program should reset `current_set` and `current_count`, but it should also check if the previously accumulated lowercase characters form a valid "pretty" set before resetting.
3. The final check after the loop does not properly account for the possibility that the last segment of lowercase characters could be a valid "pretty" set.

To fix these issues, the program needs to ensure that it checks for the validity of the set of lowercase characters before resetting when an uppercase letter is encountered. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    
    def is_pretty(current_set):
        return len(current_set) == len(set(current_set))
    
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            if is_pretty(current_set):
                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    
    # Check the last segment of lowercase characters
    if is_pretty(current_set):
        max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    
    print(max_count)
```

With this correction, the program ensures that it checks whether the current set of lowercase characters is "pretty" before updating `max_count` and properly handles the case where the last segment of lowercase characters is a valid "pretty" set.

Correctness: **False**
