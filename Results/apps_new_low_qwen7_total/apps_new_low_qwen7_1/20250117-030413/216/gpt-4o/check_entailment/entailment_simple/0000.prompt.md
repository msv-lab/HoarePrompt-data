Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

max_count = 0

current_set = set()

current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`, `current_set` is a set containing all unique lowercase characters encountered in `s` up to the last iteration, and `current_count` is 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)

print(max_count)
