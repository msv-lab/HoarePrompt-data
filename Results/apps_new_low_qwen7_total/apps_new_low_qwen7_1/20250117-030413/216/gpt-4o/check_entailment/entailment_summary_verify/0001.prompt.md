You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` (consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters). It determines the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`. The function does not explicitly accept `n` and `s` as parameters; instead, it reads them from standard input. After reading `n` and `s`, the function iterates through each character in `s`. If a character is lowercase and not already in the `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`. If a character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` with the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, then resets `current_set` and `current_count`. Finally, it prints the value of `max_count`, which is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each character of the string `s`. It uses a set `current_set` to keep track of distinct lowercase characters encountered so far and updates the count `current_count` whenever a new lowercase character is added to the set. When an uppercase character is encountered, it checks the maximum size of `current_set` found so far and resets `current_set` and `current_count`.

However, the logic for checking the presence of uppercase letters between the positions of distinct lowercase characters is missing. The program should ensure that once an uppercase character is found, no more characters are added to `current_set` until the end of the string or until another uppercase character is encountered.

Here's a corrected version of the logic within the loop:

- If an uppercase character is encountered, the program should reset `current_set` and `current_count` but continue checking the remaining part of the string.
- After the loop, the final `max_count` should be updated one last time to account for any remaining distinct lowercase characters.

### Analysis of Provided Code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_count` is initialized to 0.
   - `current_set` is a set used to track distinct lowercase characters.
   - `current_count` is used to count the number of distinct lowercase characters in the current segment.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, add it to `current_set` and increment `current_count`.
     - If the character is uppercase, update `max_count` with the current `current_count`, clear `current_set`, and reset `current_count` to 0.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, update `max_count` one last time to account for any remaining characters in `current_set`.

The provided code is almost correct, but it doesn't handle the case where the string ends with a sequence of distinct lowercase characters without an intervening uppercase character. Therefore, we need to ensure that the final `current_count` is also considered for `max_count`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
            
    # Final check in case the string ends with distinct lowercase characters
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    
    print(max_count)
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is almost correct but needs a small adjustment to handle the final count correctly. Given this, the original program would still work correctly in most cases, but the final check ensures completeness.

**Correctness: True**
