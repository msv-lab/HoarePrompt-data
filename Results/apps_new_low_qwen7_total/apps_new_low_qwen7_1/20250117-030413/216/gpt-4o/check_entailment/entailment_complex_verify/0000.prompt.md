You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

max_count = 0

current_set = set()

current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`, `current_set` is a set containing all unique lowercase characters encountered in `s` up to the last iteration, and `current_count` is 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)

print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` (consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters). It determines the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`. The function does not explicitly accept `n` and `s` as parameters; instead, it reads them from standard input. After reading `n` and `s`, the function iterates through each character in `s`. If a character is lowercase and not already in the `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`. If a character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` with the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, then resets `current_set` and `current_count`. Finally, it prints the value of `max_count`, which is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase characters in `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables to keep track of the maximum count (`max_count`), the current set of characters (`current_set`), and the current count of unique lowercase characters (`current_count`).

2. **Iterating through the string**: The program iterates through each character in the string. For each character:
   - If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
   - If the character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` with the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`, and then clears `current_set` and resets `current_count`.

3. **Final check**: After the loop, it checks one last time to ensure the maximum value is updated if the final sequence of lowercase characters forms a valid pretty set.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies sequences of lowercase letters without any intervening uppercase letters and updates the maximum count accordingly. Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all provided test cases and potential edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
