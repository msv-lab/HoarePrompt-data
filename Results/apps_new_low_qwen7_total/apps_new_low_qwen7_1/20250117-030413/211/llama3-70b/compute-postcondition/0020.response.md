The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is 4
- `n` is 5
- `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
- `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3]
- `k` is 3
- `l` is 2
- `r` is 6

The code block executes the following actions:
1. Prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`.
2. Increments `k` by 1.
3. Assigns the value of `r` to `l`.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Printing the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` outputs:
   ```
   3 2 6
   ```

2. Incrementing `k` by 1 changes `k` from 3 to 4.

3. Assigning `r` to `l` changes `l` from 2 to 6.

No other variables are modified by the code.

Thus, the final state is:
Output State: **i is 4, n is 5, a is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], k is 4, l is 6, r is 6**
