Output State: **i is 4, n is 5, a is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], k is 1, l is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line prints 'YES'.
- The second line assigns the value 1 to the variable `k`.
- The third line assigns the value 1 to the variable `l`.

All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
