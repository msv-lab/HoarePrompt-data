Output State: **i is 4, n is 5, a is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], prefix_sum is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], k is 3, l is 2, r is 2**

Explanation:
- The first line `print(k, l, r)` prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`, which are 2, 1, and 2 respectively.
- The second line `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1, changing it from 2 to 3.
- The third line `l = r` assigns the value of `r` (which is 2) to `l`, updating `l` to 2.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
