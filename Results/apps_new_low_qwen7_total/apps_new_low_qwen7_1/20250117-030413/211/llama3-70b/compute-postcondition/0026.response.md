Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and each element \( a_i \) satisfies \( -10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3 \)). It calculates the prefix sums of the list and checks if the sum of the entire list is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of contiguous subarrays whose sums are non-zero and prints their starting and ending indices along with the index of the last element processed. The function also handles the case where the input list might be empty, although the current implementation does not explicitly handle this scenario.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty, the function should handle this case, but the current code does not check for this scenario. To ensure robustness, the function should either raise an error or return a specific message indicating that the list is empty.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The current implementation does not explicitly check for the case where the list is empty. This should be added to the function to prevent runtime errors.
