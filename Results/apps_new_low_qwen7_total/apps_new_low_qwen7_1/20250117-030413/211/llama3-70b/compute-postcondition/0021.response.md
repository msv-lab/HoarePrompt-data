Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], `k` is 4, `l` is 6, `r` is 6. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is set to 4 and `r` is set to 6. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.***
