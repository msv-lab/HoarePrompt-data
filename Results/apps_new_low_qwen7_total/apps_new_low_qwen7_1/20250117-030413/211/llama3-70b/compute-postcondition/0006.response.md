`i` is 2, `n` is 5. The code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]`, which corresponds to `prefix_sum[3]` since `i` is 2. However, the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `prefix_sum[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 5, `prefix_sum[3]` is `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`**
