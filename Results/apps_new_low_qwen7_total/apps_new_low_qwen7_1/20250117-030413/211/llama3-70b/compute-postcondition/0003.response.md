The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is 5, `i` can be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `n` remains the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 5**
