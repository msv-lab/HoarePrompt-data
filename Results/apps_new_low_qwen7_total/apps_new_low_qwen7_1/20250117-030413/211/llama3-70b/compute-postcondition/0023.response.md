The code prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. The values of these variables are 4, 3, and 5 respectively. Since printing does not change the values of variables, the values of `i`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], `k` is 4, `l` is 3, `r` is 5**
