Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being iterated over the range defined by `n`.
   - Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 5.
   - `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`.

3. **Determine the Next Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given `n` is 5, `i` (which will be 2) is indeed less than 5, so the loop will execute again.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged at 5.
   - `prefix_sum[2]` does not need to be changed as it is not affected by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 5**
