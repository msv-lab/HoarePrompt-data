The given code block reads two inputs from the user: the integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then initializes a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. However, since the input values for `n` and the list `a` are not provided, we need to assume typical values to illustrate the final state.

Let's assume the following inputs for illustration purposes:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]`

Hereâ€™s how the code would execute with these inputs:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. For our example, `n` is set to 5.
2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and converts them to a list of integers. For our example, `a` is set to `[1, -2, 3, -4, 5]`.
3. `prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)`: This line creates a list `prefix_sum` of length `n + 1` (i.e., 6 in this case) and fills it with zeros. So, `prefix_sum` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

After running the code with the assumed inputs, the final state is:
Output State: **n is 5, a is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], prefix_sum is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
