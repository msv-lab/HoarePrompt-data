### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program computes the prefix sums (`prefix_sum`) where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray.
   
3. **Checking the Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to split the array such that every subarray has a non-zero sum.
   
4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - If the total sum is not zero, the program iterates through the prefix sums to find points where the sum changes from zero to non-zero or vice versa. These points are used to define the subarrays.
   - The program correctly handles splitting the array by maintaining a counter `k` for the number of subarrays and updating indices `l` and `r` to represent the start and end of each subarray.
   - The program ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum and correctly updates the start index `l` whenever a valid subarray ending at `r` is found.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and their respective indices.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required logic and handles all specified edge cases, such as when the total sum is zero or when the array consists of only zeros.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem statement and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
