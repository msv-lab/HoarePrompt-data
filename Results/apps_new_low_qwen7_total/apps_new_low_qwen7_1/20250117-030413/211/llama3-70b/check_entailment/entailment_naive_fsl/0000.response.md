Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero when splitting the array. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 -2 2 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks if the total sum of the array `prefix_sum[n]` is zero, but it does not check the subarrays for non-zero sums during the loop. To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each subarray from `l` to `r` has a non-zero sum before printing it. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        print(k, l, n)

func()
```

In this corrected version, `l` is updated to `r + 1` after processing each valid subarray, ensuring that the next subarray starts where the previous one ended. This ensures that all subarrays have non-zero sums.
