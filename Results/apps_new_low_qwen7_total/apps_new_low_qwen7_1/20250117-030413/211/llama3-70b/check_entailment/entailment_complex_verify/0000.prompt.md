You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the subsequent list of integers has length n, where each element a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 4, `n` is 5, `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3]
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')

k = 1

l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 4, `n` is 5, `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3], `k` is 4, `l` is 3, `r` is 5.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `a` is [1, -2, 3, -4, 5], `prefix_sum` is [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3]. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, the function does not change any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is 4, `l` is 3, and `r` is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and each element \( a_i \) satisfies \( -10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3 \)). It calculates the prefix sums of the list and checks if the sum of the entire list is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of contiguous subarrays whose sums are non-zero and prints their starting and ending indices along with the index of the last element processed. The function also handles the case where the input list might be empty, although the current implementation does not explicitly handle this scenario.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero when splitting the array. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 -2 2 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks if the total sum of the array `prefix_sum[n]` is zero, but it does not check the subarrays for non-zero sums during the loop. To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each subarray from `l` to `r` has a non-zero sum before printing it. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        print(k, l, n)

func()
```

In this corrected version, `l` is updated to `r + 1` after processing each valid subarray, ensuring that the next subarray starts where the previous one ended. This ensures that all subarrays have non-zero sums.
