### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the annotated code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program computes the prefix sums (`prefix_sum`) where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray.
   
3. **Checking the Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to split the array such that every subarray has a non-zero sum.
   
4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the prefix sums to find points where the sum changes from zero to non-zero or vice versa. These points are used to define the subarrays.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The program only considers the first occurrence of a non-zero prefix sum as the end of a subarray. This means that if there are multiple segments with non-zero sums that need to be separated, the program will miss some subarrays.
   - Specifically, the program should ensure that each segment between consecutive zeros in the prefix sum array is considered separately. The current implementation only considers the first such segment and ignores any subsequent segments.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and their respective indices.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the following example:
```
Input:
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3

Expected Output:
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

However, the current implementation would produce:
```
Input:
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3

Output:
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

This output is correct, but consider another example:
```
Input:
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3 4 -4 -10 7 3

Expected Output:
YES
3
1 2
3 8
9 14
```

But the current implementation would produce:
```
Input:
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3 4 -4 -10 7 3

Output:
YES
2
1 2
9 14
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program fails to correctly identify all segments with non-zero sums, especially when there are multiple segments with non-zero sums. The program only considers the first such segment and ignores any subsequent segments. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
