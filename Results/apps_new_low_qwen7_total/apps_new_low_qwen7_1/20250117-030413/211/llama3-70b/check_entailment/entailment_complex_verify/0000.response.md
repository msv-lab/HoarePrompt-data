### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the original assessment step-by-step using the provided annotated code and examples.

1. **Initial Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment states that the program fails to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum.
   - It provides an example input and expected output to demonstrate this issue.
   - The proposed correction updates the value of `l` to `r + 1` after processing each valid subarray, ensuring that the next subarray starts where the previous one ended.

2. **Program Behavior and Annotations**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program correctly calculates the prefix sums.
   - After calculating the prefix sums, it checks if the total sum of the array is zero. If it is, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to find subarrays with non-zero sums and prints their indices.

3. **Verification Using Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: 
     ```plaintext
     Input: 
     4
     1 -2 2 -1
     
     Expected Output: 
     YES
     2
     1 1
     2 4
     ```
     - The program should correctly identify two subarrays: `[1]` and `[-2, 2, -1]`.
     - The program outputs `YES` and identifies the subarrays as expected.

   - **Example 2**:
     ```plaintext
     Input: 
     8
     9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
     
     Expected Output: 
     YES
     2
     1 2
     3 8
     ```
     - The program should correctly identify two subarrays: `[9, -12]` and `[3, 4, -4, -10, 7, 3]`.
     - The program outputs `YES` and identifies the subarrays as expected.

   - **Example 3**:
     ```plaintext
     Input: 
     1
     0
     
     Expected Output: 
     NO
     ```
     - The program correctly identifies that a single-element array with a zero sum cannot be split into non-zero subarrays.
     - The program outputs `NO` as expected.

   - **Example 4**:
     ```plaintext
     Input: 
     4
     1 2 3 -5
     
     Expected Output: 
     YES
     4
     1 1
     2 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     - The program correctly identifies four subarrays: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, and `[-5]`.
     - The program outputs `YES` and identifies the subarrays as expected.

Based on the analysis and the verified examples, the original assessment is incorrect. The provided program correctly handles the problem statement and ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum. The suggested correction is unnecessary and changes the behavior of the program without improving its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
