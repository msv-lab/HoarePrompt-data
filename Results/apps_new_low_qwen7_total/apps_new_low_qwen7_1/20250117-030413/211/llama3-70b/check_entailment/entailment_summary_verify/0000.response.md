### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and evaluate its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
   - It computes the prefix sums `prefix_sum`.

2. **Checking Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, it prints "NO". This is correct since a non-zero total sum is required for the array to be split into subarrays with non-zero sums.

3. **Finding Subarrays with Non-Zero Sums:**
   - The program iterates through the prefix sums and checks if the difference between `prefix_sum[r]` and `prefix_sum[l-1]` (which is `a[l:r+1]`) is non-zero.
   - If such a subarray is found, it prints the indices `(k, l, r)` and increments the counter `k`.
   - However, the issue lies in how the variable `l` is handled. Currently, `l` is set to `r` at the end of the loop, which means the next iteration starts from the same position as the previous one, leading to incorrect subarray boundaries.

4. **Handling Subarray Boundaries:**
   - To fix this, the variable `l` should be updated to `r + 1` after processing each valid subarray. This ensures that the next subarray starts from the next element after the current one.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggested a corrected version of the program, which updates `l` to `r + 1` after processing each valid subarray. This ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum and the subarrays are properly formed.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        print(k, l, n)

func()
```

#### Evaluation:

- **Correctness:** The corrected version ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum and handles the boundary conditions correctly.
- **Functionality:** The program now correctly outputs the desired format and handles all edge cases.

Given that the corrected version addresses the issues identified in the original program and ensures that all subarrays have non-zero sums, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final:
**True**
