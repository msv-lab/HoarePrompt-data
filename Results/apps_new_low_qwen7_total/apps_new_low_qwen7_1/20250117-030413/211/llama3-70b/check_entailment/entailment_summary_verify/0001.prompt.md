You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and each element \( a_i \) satisfies \( -10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3 \)). It calculates the prefix sums of the list and checks if the sum of the entire list is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of contiguous subarrays whose sums are non-zero and prints their starting and ending indices along with the index of the last element processed. The function also handles the case where the input list might be empty, although the current implementation does not explicitly handle this scenario.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program computes the prefix sums (`prefix_sum`) where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray.
   
3. **Checking the Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to split the array such that every subarray has a non-zero sum.
   
4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - If the total sum is not zero, the program iterates through the prefix sums to find points where the sum changes from zero to non-zero or vice versa. These points are used to define the subarrays.
   - The program correctly handles splitting the array by maintaining a counter `k` for the number of subarrays and updating indices `l` and `r` to represent the start and end of each subarray.
   - The program ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum and correctly updates the start index `l` whenever a valid subarray ending at `r` is found.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and their respective indices.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required logic and handles all specified edge cases, such as when the total sum is zero or when the array consists of only zeros.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem statement and requirements.
