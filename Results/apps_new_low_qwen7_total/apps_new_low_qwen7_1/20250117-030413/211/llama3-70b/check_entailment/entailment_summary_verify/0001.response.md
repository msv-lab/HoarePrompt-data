### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the function summary and the provided examples.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly computes the prefix sums (`prefix_sum`) where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.

3. **Checking the Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the program correctly prints "NO". However, the original assessment did not explicitly mention this part, but it is indeed a critical part of the logic.

4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the prefix sums to find points where the sum changes from zero to non-zero or vice versa. This is a crucial part of the logic.
   - However, the program has some issues:
     - The program assumes that the first subarray starts from index 1, but it should ensure that the subarray includes at least one element.
     - The program should also ensure that the subarrays are non-empty and do not overlap.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and their respective indices.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `3\n1 2 -3`
  - Output: `YES\n2\n1 2\n3 3`
  - The program works correctly here.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `8\n9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3`
  - Output: `YES\n2\n1 2\n3 8`
  - The program works correctly here.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1\n0`
  - Output: `NO`
  - The program works correctly here.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4\n1 2 3 -5`
  - Output: `YES\n4\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4`
  - The program works correctly here.

However, the original assessment did not fully cover the case where the array is composed entirely of zeros. Let's consider this edge case:

- **Edge Case: Array of Zeros**
  - Input: `4\n0 0 0 0`
  - Output: `NO`
  - The program should handle this case correctly, but it currently does not check if all elements are zero before printing "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:

The program correctly identifies when the total sum is zero and prints "NO". However, it should also explicitly check if the entire array is zero and print "NO" in that case. Additionally, the program should ensure that each subarray is non-empty and correctly formatted.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct, but it lacks a specific check for the case where the entire array is zero. Therefore, the original assessment is slightly incomplete but still largely accurate.

**Final: False**

The program is almost correct but needs a minor fix to handle the edge case where the entire array is zero.
