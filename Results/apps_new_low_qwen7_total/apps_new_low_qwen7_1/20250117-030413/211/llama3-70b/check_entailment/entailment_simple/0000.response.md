Reasoning:

1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required to split the array into non-zero sum segments.
2. Specifically, the code calculates the prefix sums and checks if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints "NO" and exits, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. However, if the total sum is not zero, it enters an incorrect logic to find and print the segments. The `for` loop runs from 1 to `n+1`, but the conditions inside the loop do not ensure that the segments have non-zero sums and properly form the original array when concatenated.
4. For example, the current logic does not handle cases where multiple consecutive elements can form a valid segment (a segment with a non-zero sum).
5. The current implementation incorrectly handles the segments and might output segments that do not satisfy the problem constraints.

Given the issues identified, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
