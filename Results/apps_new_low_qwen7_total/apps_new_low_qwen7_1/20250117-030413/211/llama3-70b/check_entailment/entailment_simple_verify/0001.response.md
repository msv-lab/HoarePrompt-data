### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program computes the prefix sums (`prefix_sum`) where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray.
   
3. **Checking the Total Sum:**
   - If the total sum of the array (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to split the array such that every subarray has a non-zero sum.
   
4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - If the total sum is not zero, the program iterates through the prefix sums to find points where the sum changes from zero to non-zero or vice versa. However, the logic for splitting the array is flawed:
     - The program assumes that if `prefix_sum[r]` is not zero and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the subarray from `l` to `r` has a non-zero sum. This is not always true.
     - For example, consider the input `[-1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`. The prefix sums would be `[0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1]`. The program would incorrectly split the array into `[-1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` as a single subarray because `prefix_sum[1]` is not zero and `prefix_sum[1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[5]`.
     - Additionally, the program does not ensure that each subarray starts exactly where the previous subarray ends, except for the last subarray.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and their respective indices.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for splitting the array is incorrect, leading to potential misidentification of subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is not correct according to the problem statement and requirements.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
