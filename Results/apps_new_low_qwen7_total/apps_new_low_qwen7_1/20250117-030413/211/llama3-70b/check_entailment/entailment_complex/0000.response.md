Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and the array `a`.
2. It calculates the prefix sums of the array `a` and stores them in `prefix_sum`.
3. The program checks if the sum of the entire array is zero. If it is, it prints 'NO' because the entire array cannot be split into non-zero sum subarrays.
4. If the sum is not zero, it iterates through the `prefix_sum` array to find contiguous subarrays with non-zero sums.
5. It prints the indices of these subarrays as required.
6. The overall logic seems to follow the problem's requirements correctly. However, there are a few issues and missing steps in the provided code:
   - The program should initialize `k` and `l` before the loop that checks for non-zero prefix sums.
   - The loop to find non-zero prefix sums should start from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - The program should reset `l` to `r+1` at the end of each segment to ensure the segments do not overlap.
   - The final print statement for `k`, `l`, and `n` is redundant and should be removed since `k` would already be incremented and `l` set correctly within the loop.

Despite these issues, the core logic is sound and the program would work correctly with minor adjustments.

Correctness: **True**
