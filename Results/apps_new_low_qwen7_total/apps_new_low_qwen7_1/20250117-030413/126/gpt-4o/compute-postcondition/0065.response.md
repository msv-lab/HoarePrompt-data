The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop without changing any of the variables. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the value of `accident_possible` remains `True`.

Output State: **`accident_possible` is `True`, `j`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, and `total` are as specified by the final state of the loop execution.**
