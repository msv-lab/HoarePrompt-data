Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[2]`, and the loop will execute if `j < 3`. Additionally, `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals 1.**
