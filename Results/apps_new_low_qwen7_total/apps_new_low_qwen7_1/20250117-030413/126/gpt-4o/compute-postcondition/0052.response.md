Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is `True` if neither `traffic_lights[0][2]` nor `traffic_lights[1][3]` is `1` otherwise `accident_possible` is `False`, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[i]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[i]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[i]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[i]`. If `l == 1` or `s == 1` or `r == 1`, `accident_possible` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains `True`.***
