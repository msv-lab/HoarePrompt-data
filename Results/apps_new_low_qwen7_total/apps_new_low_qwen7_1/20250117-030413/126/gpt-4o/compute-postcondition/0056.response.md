Postcondition: ***accident_possible is `True`, `total` is unspecified, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals 1, `accident_possible` remains `True`. Otherwise, the condition of `accident_possible` remains unchanged.***
