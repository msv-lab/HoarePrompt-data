Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
- `accident_possible` is `False`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
- `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
- `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
- `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]` and `p` is equal to `1`.
- `j` is `1`.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(3):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0`.

2. **First Iteration (`j = 0`):**
   - Check `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]`:
     - This evaluates to `traffic_lights[(1 + 0) % 4][0]` which simplifies to `traffic_lights[1][0]`.
   - Suppose `traffic_lights[1][0]` is `1`. Then `accident_possible` remains `False`.
   - No changes to `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, or `j` since they are not modified within the loop.

3. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`):**
   - Check `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]`:
     - This evaluates to `traffic_lights[(1 + 1) % 4][1]` which simplifies to `traffic_lights[2][1]`.
   - Suppose `traffic_lights[2][1]` is `1`. Then `accident_possible` remains `False`.
   - No changes to `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, or `j` since they are not modified within the loop.

4. **Third Iteration (`j = 2`):**
   - Check `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]`:
     - This evaluates to `traffic_lights[(1 + 2) % 4][2]` which simplifies to `traffic_lights[3][2]`.
   - Suppose `traffic_lights[3][2]` is `1`. Then `accident_possible` remains `False`.
   - No changes to `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, or `j` since they are not modified within the loop.

5. **Fourth Iteration (`j = 3`):**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `2`, this iteration does not occur.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- The loop has completed its iterations without setting `accident_possible` to `True`.
- Therefore, `accident_possible` remains `False`.
- `i` remains `1`.
- `j` is incremented by `1` from the last iteration, so `j` becomes `2`.

### Final State:
- `traffic_lights` remains unchanged.
- `accident_possible` is `False`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `j` is `2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `accident_possible` is `False`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `j` is `2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is False, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
