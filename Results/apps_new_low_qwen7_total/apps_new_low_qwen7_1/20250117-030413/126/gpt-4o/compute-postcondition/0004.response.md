The code `traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` has the following impacts:

1. It prompts the user to enter a line of space-separated integers using `input()`.
2. These integers are then converted to a list of integers using `map(int, ...)` and `list(...)`.
3. This new list of integers is appended to the existing `traffic_lights` list.

Since the initial state is that `traffic_lights` is a list containing one list of integers, after executing the code, `traffic_lights` will now contain two lists: the original list and the newly entered list of integers.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing two lists of integers: the original list and a new list of integers entered by the user**
