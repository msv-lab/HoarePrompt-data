Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is False, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]` and `p` is equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals 1, `accident_possible` is set to False. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` does not equal 1, `accident_possible` remains True.***
