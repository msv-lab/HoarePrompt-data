Output State: `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, each list representing the integers entered by the user in each iteration of the loop. The loop will execute exactly 4 times regardless of the input provided because the number of iterations is specified by the `range(4)` function. Therefore, `traffic_lights` will have exactly 4 elements, each being a list of integers entered by the user.
