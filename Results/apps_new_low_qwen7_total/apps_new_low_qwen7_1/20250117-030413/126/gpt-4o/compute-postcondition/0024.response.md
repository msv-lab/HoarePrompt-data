Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If the element at index `(i + j) % 4` in the `j`-th list of `traffic_lights` is 1, `accident_possible` is set to True. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False, and the other variables retain their original values.***
