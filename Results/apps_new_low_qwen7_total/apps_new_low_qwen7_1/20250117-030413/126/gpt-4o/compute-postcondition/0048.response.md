Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is `True` if neither `traffic_lights[0][2]` nor `traffic_lights[1][3]` is `1`. Otherwise, `accident_possible` becomes `False`. This holds whether `p` is `1` or not within the if-else block since there are no changes to `total`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` outside the if condition.***
