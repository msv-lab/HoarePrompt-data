The provided Python code snippet appends a list of integers to the `traffic_lights` list, where the integers are obtained from user input and split using the `split()` method. However, the initial state does not specify what `traffic_lights` contains before this operation, and the code snippet itself does not provide a direct value or specific condition to determine the content of `traffic_lights`. 

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

```python
traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
```

Since the initial state does not specify the current content of `traffic_lights` and we are only appending a new list of integers, the only thing we can infer is that `traffic_lights` will now contain the newly appended list.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` contains the newly appended list of integers obtained from user input**
