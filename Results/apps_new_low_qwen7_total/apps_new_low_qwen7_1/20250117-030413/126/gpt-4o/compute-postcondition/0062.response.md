Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` is `False` or `True` depending on the condition `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1`. If the condition is met, `accident_possible` is set to `True`. If the condition is not met, `accident_possible` remains `False`. The variable `total` is unspecified. The variable `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers. The variables `j`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` retain their original values as specified in the precondition.***
