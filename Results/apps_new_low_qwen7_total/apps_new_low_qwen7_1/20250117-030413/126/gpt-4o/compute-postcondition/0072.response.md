The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables. The `traffic_lights` list and the `accident_possible` variable retain their initial states.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is `False`**
