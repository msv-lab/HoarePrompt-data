Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is `True` if neither `traffic_lights[0][2]` nor `traffic_lights[1][3]` is `1` otherwise `accident_possible` is `False`, `j` is `0`, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, and `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is `1`**
