The code initializes an empty list named `traffic_lights`. This means that the list `traffic_lights` is now populated with an empty list, but the initial state's traffic light configurations (the four lines of four integers each) are lost because no input is taken and assigned to `traffic_lights`.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is an empty list**
