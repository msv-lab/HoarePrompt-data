Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[2]`. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` equals 1, `accident_possible` is set to True. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
