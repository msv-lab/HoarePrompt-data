Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, and `p` is equal to 1. If the condition `l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1` is met, `accident_possible` remains True.***
