Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[2]`. The value of `accident_possible` remains True since neither `traffic_lights[0][2]` nor `traffic_lights[1][3]` is 1.***
