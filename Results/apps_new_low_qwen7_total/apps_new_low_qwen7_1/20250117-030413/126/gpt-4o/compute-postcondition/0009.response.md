Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 0 to 3.
   - The list `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
   - The boolean variable `accident_possible` is initially set to `False`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4.
   - For the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be 0.

3. **Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
   - `accident_possible` is `False`.

4. **Conditions for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0.
   - There are no other conditions specified for the loop to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the first execution of the loop must be:

- `i` is 0.
- `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
- `accident_possible` is `False`.

State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is `False`, `i` is 0**
