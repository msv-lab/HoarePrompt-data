Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is equal to 1, and `j` is 0. If the current value of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is 1, the function continues with the condition as is. If the current value of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is not 1, the overall state remains unchanged.***
