Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 1, j is 2, traffic_lights is a list containing four lists of integers**

Explanation:
- The first line sets `accident_possible` to `True`.
- The second line `break` statement is outside of any loop or `switch` construct in this context, so it will cause the interpreter to exit the current loop or match case if there was one, but since no such construct exists here, it essentially ends the code block prematurely without affecting any other variables.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 1 and 2 respectively.
- The value of `traffic_lights` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code block.
