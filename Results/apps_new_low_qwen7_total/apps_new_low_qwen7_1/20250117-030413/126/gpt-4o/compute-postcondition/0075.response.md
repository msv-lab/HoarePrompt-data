Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four parts of the intersection. It checks if there is a possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
1. If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), then if any of the left (l), straight (s), or right (r) traffic lights are also green, an accident is considered possible.
2. Additionally, if the pedestrian light is green and any adjacent traffic light in the next intersection segment is also green, an accident is considered possible.
The function outputs 'YES' if an accident is possible based on the given conditions, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the scenario where the pedestrian light is green and any adjacent traffic light is also green, considering the circular nature of the intersection (i.e., it wraps around to the first segment when reaching the fourth).
- The function does not handle invalid input such as non-integer values or more than four lines of input. If the input does not conform to the expected format, the function may produce unexpected results or raise an error.**
  
**Final state of the program after it concludes:**
- `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, each list representing the integers entered by the user.
- `accident_possible` is `True` if any of the conditions for an accident are met, and `False` otherwise.
- The function prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `accident_possible`.
