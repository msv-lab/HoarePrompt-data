Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 2, j is 3, l is the first element of traffic_lights[2], s is the second element of traffic_lights[2], r is the third element of traffic_lights[2], p is the fourth element of traffic_lights[2], total is 0**

Explanation: The code consists of a single line `accident_possible = True`. This line sets `accident_possible` to `True` without affecting any other variables or the list `traffic_lights`. The values of `i`, `j`, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state. The variable `total` also remains unchanged at 0.
