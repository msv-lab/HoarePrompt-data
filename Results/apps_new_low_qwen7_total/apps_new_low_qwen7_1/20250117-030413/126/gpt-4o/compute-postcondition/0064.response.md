Postcondition: **`accident_possible` is `True` if any `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is `1`, otherwise `accident_possible` is `False`. All other variables (`j`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`, `total`) are as specified by the final state of the loop execution. The current value of `accident_possible` is `True`**
