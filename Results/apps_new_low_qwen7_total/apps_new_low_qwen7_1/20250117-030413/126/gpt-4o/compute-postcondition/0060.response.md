Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop is defined as `for j in range(3)`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to 2.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `accident_possible` is `False`
   - `total` is unspecified
   - `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers
   - `j` is 1 (indicating the current value of `j` is 1)
   - `l` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`
   - `s` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`
   - `r` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`
   - `p` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since `j` ranges from 0 to 2, and the current value of `j` is 1, the next value of `j` will be 2.

4. **Adjust States for the Next Iteration**: We only need to adjust the state of `j` since it is the loop variable. The other variables (`accident_possible`, `total`, `traffic_lights`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but may be modified within the loop body. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we focus on `j`.

5. **Final State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to its next value, which is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`accident_possible` is `False`, `total` is unspecified, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `j` is 2, `l` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`**
