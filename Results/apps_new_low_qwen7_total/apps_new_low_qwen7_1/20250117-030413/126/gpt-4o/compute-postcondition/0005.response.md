The loop head contains the following variables: `_` (a placeholder for the loop variable, typically an index), and no other variables directly mentioned in the loop header. The list `traffic_lights` is not part of the loop head but rather a state that exists outside the loop.

According to the given loop:
```python
for _ in range(4):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This means the loop will run exactly 4 times. Since the loop has already run for the fourth time (as indicated by the range being from 0 to 3, inclusive), it will not execute again.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states because the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Final State:** **`traffic_lights` is a list containing two lists of integers: the original list and a new list of integers entered by the user**
