Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j`. It ranges from `0` to `2` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `accident_possible` is `True`.
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]` (which is `traffic_lights[0][0]`).
   - `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]` (which is `traffic_lights[0][1]`).
   - `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]` (which is `traffic_lights[0][2]`).
   - `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]` (which is `traffic_lights[0][3]`).

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than `3`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `1`.

4. **Adjust the relevant states**:
   - `j` will be updated to `1`.
   - `l` will be updated to `traffic_lights[0][1]` (since `j` changes from `0` to `1`).
   - `s` will be updated to `traffic_lights[0][2]`.
   - `r` will be updated to `traffic_lights[0][3]`.
   - `p` will be updated to `traffic_lights[0][0]` (the value of the first element of `traffic_lights[0]` does not change).

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: Since `accident_possible` is determined by the condition inside the loop, it remains as `True` unless the condition within the loop changes it.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`accident_possible` is `True`, `total` is unspecified, `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `j` is `1`, `l` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`**.
