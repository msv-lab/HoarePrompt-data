Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`, and `p` is equal to 1, `j` is 2. If any of the elements at the positions `(i + j) % 4` in the respective sublists are 1, `accident_possible` is set to True. Since there is no else part, `accident_possible` remains True regardless of whether the condition in the if statement is met or not.***
