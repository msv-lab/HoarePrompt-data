The code appends a list of integers (converted from user input) to the `traffic_lights` list. Since the initial state is that `traffic_lights` is an empty list, after executing the line of code, `traffic_lights` will contain one new list. However, the actual values in this list depend on the user input, which is not specified here. Therefore, we can represent the updated `traffic_lights` as containing a list of integers.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing one list of integers**
