Let's break down the task step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `traffic_lights` is a list containing one list of integers.
- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(4):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_` is used here, which is an underscore typically used as a throwaway variable when no value from the iterable is needed.
   - The loop runs for a fixed number of times (4 times) as specified by `range(4)`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `traffic_lights` is a list containing one list of integers.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop runs for 4 iterations and the current state is after the previous iteration, it means this is the 3rd iteration.
   - Therefore, there is one more iteration left before the loop completes.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - No specific changes are required for the variable `_` because it is a throwaway variable.
   - The key variable to consider is `traffic_lights`, but since the loop itself doesn't modify `traffic_lights`, its state remains unchanged for the next iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:

Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations and does not modify the state of `traffic_lights`, the state remains the same for the next iteration.

**State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing one list of integers**
