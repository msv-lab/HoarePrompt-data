The code assigns the elements of `traffic_lights[i]` to the variables `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p`. Given that `i` is 2, we know that `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` will take the values from `traffic_lights[2]`.

Therefore, the values of `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` will be the same as the corresponding elements in `traffic_lights[2]`.

The other variables (`traffic_lights`, `accident_possible`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[2]`**
