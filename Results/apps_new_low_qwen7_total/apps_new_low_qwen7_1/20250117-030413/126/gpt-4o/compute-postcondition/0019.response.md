Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 2 (inclusive), so it will be updated to the next value within this range.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts:**
   - `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers.
   - `accident_possible` is `True`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
   - `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
   - `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
   - `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
   - `p` is equal to 1.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Consider the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues if `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is 1.
   - Initially, `j` is 0, so we check `traffic_lights[(1 + 0) % 4][0]` which is `traffic_lights[1][0]`.

4. **Determine the possible values for the loop to continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `traffic_lights[1][0]` must be 1.
   - If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1, then `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is not 1, the loop will stop.

5. **Adjust the states based on the loop continuation condition:**
   - If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1, then `j` will become 1.
   - The other variables (`traffic_lights`, `accident_possible`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged because they are not in the loop head.

6. **State after the loop:**
   - If `traffic_lights[1][0]` is 1, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
     - `traffic_lights` remains the same.
     - `accident_possible` remains `True`.
     - `i` remains 1.
     - `l` remains the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
     - `s` remains the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
     - `r` remains the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`.
     - `p` remains the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]` (which is 1).
     - `j` becomes 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 1, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[0]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[0]` and `p` is equal to 1, `j` is 1**.
