Postcondition: ***`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, `accident_possible` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights[2]`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights[2]`. If `l == 1` or `s == 1` or `r == 1`, `accident_possible` is set to False. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains True.***
