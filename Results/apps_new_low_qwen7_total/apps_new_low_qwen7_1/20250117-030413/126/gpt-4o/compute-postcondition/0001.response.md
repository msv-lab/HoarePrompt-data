State before the loop starts: `traffic_lights` is an empty list.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(4):`, which means it will iterate 4 times.
2. The loop head involves a variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the range function.
3. The only variables involved in the loop head are the placeholder `_` and the range object, but since `_` is just a placeholder, we focus on the range object.
4. The range object in this case is `range(4)`, which generates numbers from 0 to 3.
5. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `0 in range(4)` must be true.
6. Since the loop is defined to run 4 times, it will always execute as long as the range object is properly defined.

Given that the only condition affecting the loop's execution is the range definition, and the state of `traffic_lights` does not influence the loop's ability to execute, the state of `traffic_lights` remains unchanged.

State: **`traffic_lights` is an empty list, the loop will execute because `range(4)` is properly defined and the loop will start with the first value 0.**
