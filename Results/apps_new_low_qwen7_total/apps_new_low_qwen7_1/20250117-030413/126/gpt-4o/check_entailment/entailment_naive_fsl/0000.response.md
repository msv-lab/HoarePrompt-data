Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light configurations. It checks each pedestrian light and verifies if any corresponding lane light is green simultaneously. If such a condition is found, it immediately sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, ensuring efficiency. The program handles all given examples and potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
