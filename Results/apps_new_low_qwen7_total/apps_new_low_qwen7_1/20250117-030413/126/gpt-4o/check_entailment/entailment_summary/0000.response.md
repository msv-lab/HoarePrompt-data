Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function `func()` initializes an empty list `traffic_lights` to store the states of the traffic lights.
2. It then reads four lines of input, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (left, straight, right, and pedestrian).
3. For each part of the intersection, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (value 1).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it further checks if any of the left (`l`), straight (`s`), or right (`r`) traffic lights are also green. If any of these are green, an accident is considered possible.
   - Additionally, it checks the adjacent traffic lights in the next part of the intersection (in a counter-clockwise manner) to see if any of them are green. If any adjacent traffic light is green, an accident is again considered possible.
4. If an accident is detected during any iteration, the variable `accident_possible` is set to `True`, and the loop breaks.
5. After checking all parts, if `accident_possible` is still `False`, it means no accidents are possible, and the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program correctly follows the logic specified in the problem statement and handles all the given examples accurately.

Correctness: **True**
