Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Processing**: The program reads the input correctly, storing the traffic light configurations in a list called `traffic_lights`. This part of the code works as expected.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For each part of the intersection (4 iterations), the program checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (value 1).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, the program further checks if any of the left (`l`), straight (`s`), or right (`r`) traffic lights are also green. If any of these are green, it sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Additionally, if the pedestrian light is green, the program checks the adjacent parts (considering the intersection in a counter-clockwise manner). Specifically, it looks at the corresponding traffic lights in the next part (using `(i + j) % 4` to wrap around the list of 4 parts).

3. **Output**: Based on the value of `accident_possible`, the program correctly prints either "YES" or "NO".

The provided examples demonstrate that the program works as intended for the given test cases.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
