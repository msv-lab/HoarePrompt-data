You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

- Program: 
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four parts of the intersection. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, each list representing the integers entered by the user in each iteration of the loop. The loop will execute exactly 4 times regardless of the input provided because the number of iterations is specified by the `range(4)` function. Therefore, `traffic_lights` will have exactly 4 elements, each being a list of integers entered by the user.
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        l, s, r, p = traffic_lights[i]

        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`traffic_lights` is a list containing four lists of integers, and `accident_possible` is set to `True` if any of the conditions within the if block are met. Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains `False`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to check if an accident is possible at the intersection based on the given problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the configuration of the traffic lights for each of the four parts of the intersection.
2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes `accident_possible` to `False`, indicating no accident has been detected yet.
3. **Loop Through Parts**: It iterates through each of the four parts of the intersection.
4. **Check Pedestrian Light**: For each part, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (i.e., `p == 1`).
5. **Check Incoming or Outgoing Traffic**: If the pedestrian light is green, it checks if any of the incoming or outgoing traffic lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are also green. If any of these are green, it sets `accident_possible` to `True`.
6. **Check Adjacent Parts**: If the pedestrian light is green and there is no conflicting traffic light, it checks the adjacent parts (considering the counter-clockwise order). Specifically, it checks the incoming traffic light of the next part (`(i + j) % 4`), where `j` ranges from 0 to 2 (since there are 3 adjacent parts per part).
7. **Output Result**: After checking all parts, if an accident was possible (`accident_possible` is `True`), it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program follows the requirements and correctly identifies whether an accident is possible based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
