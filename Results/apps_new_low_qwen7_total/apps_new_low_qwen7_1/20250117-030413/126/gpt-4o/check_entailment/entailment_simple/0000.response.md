### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check for potential accidents at the intersection. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads four lines of input, each containing four integers (representing the traffic lights for left, straight, right, and pedestrian crossings).
   - These values are stored in a list called `traffic_lights`.

2. **Accident Detection Logic**:
   - For each part of the intersection (each list in `traffic_lights`), the program checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (i.e., `p == 1`).
   - If the pedestrian light is green, the program then checks if any of the other three lights (left, straight, right) are also green.
     - If any of these lights are green, an accident is possible, and the program sets `accident_possible` to `True`.
   - Additionally, the program checks the adjacent parts of the intersection for potential accidents:
     - It iterates through the next three parts (using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list).
     - If any of the lights in these adjacent parts are green, an accident is possible, and `accident_possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output**:
   - Based on the value of `accident_possible`, the program prints either "YES" or "NO".

Given the examples and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies whether an accident is possible based on the traffic light configurations provided. The program handles all cases described in the problem statement accurately.

### Correctness: **True**
