The function processes an input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four parts of the intersection. It checks if there is a possibility of an accident based on the following conditions:
1. If the pedestrian light (p) is green (1), then if any of the left (l), straight (s), or right (r) traffic lights are also green, an accident is considered possible.
2. Additionally, if the pedestrian light is green and any adjacent traffic light in the next intersection segment is also green, an accident is considered possible.
The function outputs 'YES' if an accident is possible based on the given conditions, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.
