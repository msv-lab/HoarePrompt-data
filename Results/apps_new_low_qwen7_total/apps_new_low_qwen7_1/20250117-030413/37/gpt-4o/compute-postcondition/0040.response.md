State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop uses `range(2)` as its iterator, which generates numbers from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
2. The loop variable `_` is used, which typically indicates that the value of `_` is not needed within the loop body.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition generated by `range(2)` must be satisfied.
4. Since `range(2)` starts with 0, the loop will execute when `_` is 0.
5. The initial state given is that `n` must be greater than 0, but this does not affect the initialization of `_`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `_` must be 0 and `n` must still be greater than 0.
