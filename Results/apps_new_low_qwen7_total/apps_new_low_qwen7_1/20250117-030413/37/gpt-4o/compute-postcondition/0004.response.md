Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, steps is not defined in the final state, direction_index is (direction_index + 1) % 6, x is updated by adding dx * steps to its original value, y is updated by adding dy * steps to its original value, _ is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`, which are the changes in the x and y coordinates respectively.
- The second and third lines update the x and y coordinates by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps` to their respective values.
- The fourth line decrements `n` by the value of `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next index in the `directions` list, ensuring it wraps around using modulo operation (`% 6`).

Since the exact initial values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `direction_index` are not provided, we can only describe the changes relative to these variables. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still 0.
