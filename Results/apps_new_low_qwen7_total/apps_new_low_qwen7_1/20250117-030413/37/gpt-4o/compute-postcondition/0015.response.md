Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2, x is x plus dx times n, y is y plus dy times n, steps is not defined**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines `n` as an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2. This means `n` is a non-negative integer and strictly smaller than the original value of `n` minus 2.
- The variables `dx` and `dy` are assigned values from the list `directions` at the index specified by `direction_index`.
- The line `x += dx * n` increments `x` by the product of `dx` and `n`.
- The line `y += dy * n` increments `y` by the product of `dy` and `n`.

No other variables are defined or modified, so `steps` remains undefined. The exact numerical values of `x` and `y` depend on the specific values of `dx`, `dy`, and `n`, but they are updated based on these values.
