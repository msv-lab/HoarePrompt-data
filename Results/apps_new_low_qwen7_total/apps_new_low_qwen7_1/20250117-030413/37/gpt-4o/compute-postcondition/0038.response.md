`steps` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `steps` is 3, so after the increment, `steps` becomes 4. The other variables (`direction_index`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `dx`, `dy`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `steps` is 4, `direction_index` is the next index in the directions list after adding 1 and taking modulo 6, `x` is the original x value plus 8 times `dx` plus 3 times `dx`, and `y` is the original y value plus 8 times `dy` plus 3 times `dy` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, the function returns `x` as the original x value plus `dx` times `n` and `y` as the original y value plus `dy` times `n`.**
