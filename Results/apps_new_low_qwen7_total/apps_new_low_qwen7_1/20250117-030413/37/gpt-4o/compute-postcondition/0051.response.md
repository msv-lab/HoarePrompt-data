Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - steps)
- `x` is an updated value
- `y` is an updated value
- `direction_index` is `(original direction_index + 2) % 6`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `for _ in range(2)`. This means the loop will run twice.

### Loop Body
Since the loop body is omitted, we need to determine how the states will change based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `_` is 0 (initial value)
   - Since `_` is 0, it is less than 2, so the loop will execute once more.
   - At the end of the first iteration:
     - `_` will be incremented to 1.
     - `n` remains unchanged.
     - `x` and `y` remain unchanged because the conditions for updating them (`n >= steps`) were not met in the first iteration.
     - `direction_index` remains unchanged because the conditions for updating it (`n >= steps`) were not met in the first iteration.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `_` is 1
   - Since `_` is 1, it is still less than 2, so the loop will execute once more.
   - At the end of the second iteration:
     - `_` will be incremented to 2.
     - `n` remains unchanged.
     - `x` and `y` will be updated if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`.
     - `direction_index` will be updated to `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration (Third Iteration)

- `_` will be 2.
- `n` remains unchanged from the end of the second iteration.
- `x` and `y` will be updated according to the conditions if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`.
- `direction_index` will be updated to `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`.

### Final Answer
State: **`_` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - steps), `x` is an updated value, `y` is an updated value, and `direction_index` is `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`**
