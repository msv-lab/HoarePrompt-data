Output State: **_ is 2, n is greater than or equal to (current value - steps), x is an updated value, y is an updated value, direction_index is (original direction_index + 3) % 6, dx is a value from directions at index (original direction_index + 3) % 6, dy is a value from directions at index (original direction_index + 3) % 6**

Explanation:
1. The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` assigns the values from the `directions` list at the index specified by `direction_index` to `dx` and `dy`.
2. The line `x += dx * n` updates the value of `x` by adding `n` times `dx` to the current value of `x`.
3. The line `y += dy * n` updates the value of `y` by adding `n` times `dy` to the current value of `y`.

The precondition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - steps), and `direction_index` is `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `dx` and `dy`, respectively, multiplied by `n`. The variables `_` and `direction_index` remain unchanged.
