Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to -1 and less than its original value - 2, steps is undefined, direction_index is (direction_index + 1) % 6, x is updated, y is updated**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`.
- The second and third lines update the coordinates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps` respectively.
- The fourth line decreases the value of `n` by `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to the next index in the `directions` list using modulo 6 to ensure it cycles back to the start if it reaches the end.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `steps` are not provided, we can only specify that `x` and `y` are updated based on `dx`, `dy`, and `steps`, and `n` is decreased by `steps`. The value of `direction_index` is updated to the next value in the cycle. `steps` is not defined before the code block, so it remains undefined after the code block. `n` is constrained to be an integer greater than or equal to -1 and less than its original value minus 2 after the operation.
