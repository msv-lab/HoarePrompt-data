The code `steps += 1` increments the value of `steps` by 1. Initially, `steps` is not defined, so it will be assigned to 1 after this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2, `steps` is 1, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 2) % 6`, `x` is updated by adding `dx * steps` to its original value twice, and `y` is updated by adding `dy * steps` to its original value twice.**
