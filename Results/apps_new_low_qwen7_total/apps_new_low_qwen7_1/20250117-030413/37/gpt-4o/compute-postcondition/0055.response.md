Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - 3), `x` and `y` are updated values. If `n` >= `steps`, then `direction_index` is `(original direction_index + 4) % 6`. Otherwise, the program returns `x` and `y` as updated values corresponding to the direction at index `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`**.
