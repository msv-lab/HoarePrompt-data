Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `steps` is 3, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 2) % 6`, `x` is the original x value + 4 * `dx`, `y` is the original y value + 4 * `dy`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is updated to `n - 3`, `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, `x` is updated to the original x value + 3 * `dx`, and `y` is updated to the original y value + 3 * `dy`. Otherwise, the function returns `x` as the original x value + 4 * `dx` and `y` as the original y value + 4 * `dy`.***
