Output State: **x is x + (dx * n), y is y + (dy * n), n is unchanged, steps is unchanged, direction_index is unchanged, directions is unchanged, _ is 0**

Explanation: 
- The first line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` extracts the values of `dx` and `dy` from the list `directions` at the index `direction_index`.
- The second line `x += dx * n` updates the value of `x` by adding `dx * n` to it.
- The second line `y += dy * n` updates the value of `y` by adding `dy * n` to it.
- The variables `n`, `steps`, `direction_index`, `directions`, and `_` remain unchanged.
