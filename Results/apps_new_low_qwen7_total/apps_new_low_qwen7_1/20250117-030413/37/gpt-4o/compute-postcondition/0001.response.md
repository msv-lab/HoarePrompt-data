Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `n > 0`.
2. **Current State**: The current state right before the loop is given as `n` being an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
3. **Determine the Requirement for the First Iteration**: For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `n > 0` must be satisfied.

Given that `n` can be any integer between 0 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, we need to ensure that `n` is strictly greater than 0 for the loop to enter the first iteration. 

Therefore, the only modification required is to ensure that `n` is not equal to 0 but greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
