Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, `steps` is not defined. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, `x` is updated by adding `dx * steps` to its original value, and `y` is updated by adding `dy * steps` to its original value. If `n` is less than `steps`, the function returns `x` which is `x0 + dx * n`, and `y` which is `y0 + dy * n`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts and their respective conditions.
