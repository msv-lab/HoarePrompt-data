You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18.
```
def func_1(n):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns x and y, where x and y are updated values

Case_2: `The program returns x which is x0 + dx * n, and y which is y0 + dy * n`

Case_3: The program returns x and y, where x is x plus dx times n, and y is y plus dy times n

Case_4: x is updated by adding dx * n to its original value twice, y is updated by adding dy * n to its original value twice, and the program returns (x, y)

Case_5: The program returns x that is original x value + 4 * dx and y that is original y value + 4 * dy

Case_6: `The program returns x, y where x is the original x value + dx * n and y is the original y value + dy * n`

Case_7: `x` is x + (dx * n) and `y` is y + (dy * n)

Case_8: `The program returns x that is updated to its original value plus dx * n, and y that is updated to its original value plus dy * n`

Case_9: The program returns x and y, where x and y are updated values corresponding to the direction at index (original direction_index + 3) % 6

Case_10: The program returns x and y, where \( x = x_{initial} + 8 \times (dx_1 + dx_2 + \ldots + dx_k) + n \times dx \) and \( y = y_{initial} + 8 \times (dy_1 + dy_2 + \ldots + dy_k) + n \times dy \)

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
