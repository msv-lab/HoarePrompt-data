The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Based on the provided cases, the function returns different combinations of `x` and `y`:

- **Case_1**: The program returns `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are updated values.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `x` which is `x0 + dx * n`, and `y` which is `y0 + dy * n`.
- **Case_3**: The program returns `x` and `y`, where `x` is `x` plus `dx` times `n`, and `y` is `y` plus `dy` times `n`.
- **Case_4**: `x` is updated by adding `dx * n` to its original value twice, `y` is updated by adding `dy * n` to its original value twice, and the program returns `(x, y)`.
- **Case_5**: The program returns `x` that is the original `x` value + `4 * dx` and `y` that is the original `y` value + `4 * dy`.
- **Case_6**: The program returns `x, y` where `x` is the original `x` value + `dx * n` and `y` is the original `y` value + `dy * n`.
- **Case_7**: `x` is `x + (dx * n)` and `y` is `y + (dy * n)`.
- **Case_8**: The program returns `x` that is updated to its original value plus `dx * n`, and `y` that is updated to its original value plus `dy * n`.
- **Case_9**: The program returns `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are updated values corresponding to the direction at index `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`.
- **Case_10**: The program returns `x` and `y`, where \( x = x_{initial} + 8 \times (dx_1 + dx_2 + \ldots + dx_k) + n \times dx \) and \( y = y_{initial} + 8 \times (dy_1 + dy_2 + \ldots + dy_k) + n \times dy \).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and based on specific conditions, return updated values of `x` and `y` in various ways as described above.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, and returns `x` and `y` based on specific conditions including updates involving `dx`, `dy`, and `n`.**
