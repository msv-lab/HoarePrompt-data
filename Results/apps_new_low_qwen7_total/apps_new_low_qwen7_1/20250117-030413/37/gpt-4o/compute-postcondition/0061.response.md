Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input and returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`. The function uses a set of predefined movement directions to update the coordinates `x` and `y` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it updates `x` and `y` by moving in different directions depending on the current step count and the remaining value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to the current step size, it moves in a full step in the current direction. Otherwise, it performs a partial step and then exits the function. After exiting the loop, the function returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` based on the accumulated movements.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where `n` becomes less than the current step size within the loop by performing a partial step and returning the results immediately.
- The function updates the `direction_index` to cycle through the predefined directions.
- The final state of the function is that `x` and `y` are updated according to the accumulated movements and the remaining value of `n`.
- There is no explicit handling for `n` being negative; the function assumes `n` is non-negative.
- The function does not perform any operations outside the main loop once `n` becomes non-positive.
