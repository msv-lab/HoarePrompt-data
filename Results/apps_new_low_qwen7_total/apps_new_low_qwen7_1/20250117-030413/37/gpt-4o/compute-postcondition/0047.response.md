Output State: **n is greater than or equal to (current value - 4), x is an updated value equal to its original value plus dx * 4, y is an updated value equal to its original value plus dy * 4, direction_index is (original direction_index + 3) % 6**

Explanation:
1. The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` assigns the values from the `directions` list at the index `direction_index` to `dx` and `dy`.
2. The line `x += dx * steps` updates the value of `x` by adding `dx * 4` to its current value. This means `x` is now `x + dx * 4`.
3. The line `y += dy * steps` updates the value of `y` by adding `dy * 4` to its current value. This means `y` is now `y + dy * 4`.
4. The line `n -= steps` decreases the value of `n` by `steps`, which is 4. Therefore, `n` becomes `n - 4`, satisfying the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - steps).
5. The line `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6` updates `direction_index` to the next value in the cycle, which is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.

Since the exact initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `direction_index` are not provided, the final state is described in terms of the changes made by the code.
