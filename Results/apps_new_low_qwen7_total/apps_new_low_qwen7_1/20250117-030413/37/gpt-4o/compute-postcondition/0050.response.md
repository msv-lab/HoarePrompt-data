Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to (current value - steps), `x` is an updated value, `y` is an updated value, and `direction_index` is `(original direction_index + 2) % 6`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `x` is updated to its original value plus `dx * 4`, `y` is updated to its original value plus `dy * 4`, and `direction_index` is updated to `(original direction_index + 3) % 6`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to its original value plus `dx * n`, and `y` is updated to its original value plus `dy * n`.***
