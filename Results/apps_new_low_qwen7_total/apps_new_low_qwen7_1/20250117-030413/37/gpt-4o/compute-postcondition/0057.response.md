The value of `steps` is incremented by 1. The value of `direction_index` remains unchanged as the given line of code does not affect it. The values of `x` and `y` are also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `steps` and retains the original values of `n`, `direction_index`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`n` < `steps + 1`, `direction_index` = (`original direction_index` + 2) % 6, `x` and `y` are updated values based on the directions applied over the two iterations.**
