Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0 and at least 1 less than its original value, steps is defined with a positive integer value, direction_index is updated to (direction_index + 1) % 6, x is updated by adding dx * steps to its original value, y is updated by adding dy * steps to its original value, dx and dy are the components of the direction corresponding to direction_index, _ is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the values of `directions[direction_index]` to `dx` and `dy`.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to its original value.
- The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to its original value.
- The fourth line decrements `n` by `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, ensuring it cycles through the indices of the `directions` list.

All other variables remain unchanged. `n` is updated to be at least 1 less than its original value, `steps` is defined, `direction_index` is updated, and `x` and `y` are updated based on `dx`, `dy`, and `steps`.
