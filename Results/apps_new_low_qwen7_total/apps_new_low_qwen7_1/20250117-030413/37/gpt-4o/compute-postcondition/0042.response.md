Output State: **n is greater than or equal to (current value - steps), _ is 0, x is updated value, y is updated value, direction_index is (original direction_index + 1) % 6**

Explanation:
- The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` fetches the direction vector from the `directions` list at the index specified by `direction_index`.
- The line `x += dx * steps` updates the value of `x` by adding the product of `dx` and `steps` to the current value of `x`.
- The line `y += dy * steps` updates the value of `y` by adding the product of `dy` and `steps` to the current value of `y`.
- The line `n -= steps` decreases the value of `n` by `steps`.
- The line `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6` increments `direction_index` by 1 and takes modulo 6 to ensure it stays within the bounds of the list (assuming `directions` has 6 elements).

Since the exact initial values of `x`, `y`, `direction_index`, `directions`, and `steps` are not provided, we can only express the final state in terms of these variables. The key is that `n` is reduced by `steps`, `x` and `y` are updated based on the direction vector, and `direction_index` wraps around if incremented beyond the length of `directions`.
