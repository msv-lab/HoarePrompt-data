Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2, `steps` is not defined, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, `x` and `y` are updated as follows: if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `x` is updated and `y` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the function returns `x + dx * n` and `y + dy * n`***
