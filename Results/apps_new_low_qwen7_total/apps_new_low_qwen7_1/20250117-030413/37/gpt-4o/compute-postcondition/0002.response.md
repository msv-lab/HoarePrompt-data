State before the loop starts: `n` must be greater than 0
```
for _ in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop uses `range(2)`, which means the loop will iterate twice.
2. For the first iteration of the loop, the loop counter (in this case represented by `_`) needs to be within the range specified by `range(2)`.
3. The only variables or conditions controlling the loop's execution are the loop counter and the range definition.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start, and considering the loop runs based on `range(2)`, we need to ensure that the loop counter `_` is valid for the first iteration. The loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

For the first iteration:
- The loop counter `_` should be 0.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start, there are no additional constraints needed for `n` specifically for the first iteration, as long as `n > 0`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
