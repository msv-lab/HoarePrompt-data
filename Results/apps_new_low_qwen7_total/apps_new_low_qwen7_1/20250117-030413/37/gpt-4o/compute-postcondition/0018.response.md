Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2, `steps` is not defined, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 2) % 6`, `x` is updated by adding `dx * steps` to its original value twice, and `y` is updated by adding `dy * steps` to its original value twice.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for exactly 2 iterations based on the provided information.
- After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `steps`. Therefore, after 2 iterations, `n` is reduced by `2 * steps`, making it `n - 2 * steps`.
- `direction_index` is updated by `(direction_index + 1) % 6` each time the condition `n >= steps` is satisfied. Since the loop runs 2 times, `direction_index` is updated twice, resulting in `direction_index` being updated to `(direction_index + 2) % 6`.
- For each iteration where `n >= steps`, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps` respectively. Since this happens twice, `x` and `y` are each updated by `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dy * steps` respectively.
- When `n < steps` after the last iteration, the function returns `x` and `y` without further updates, but this condition is not relevant to the final state of the loop's execution.
