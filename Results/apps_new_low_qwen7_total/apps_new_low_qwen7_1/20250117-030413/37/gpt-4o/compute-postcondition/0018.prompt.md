Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    if n >= steps:
        dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
        x += dx * steps
        y += dy * steps
        n -= steps
        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
    else:
        dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
        x += dx * n
        y += dy * n
        return x, y


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, steps is not defined in the final state, direction_index is (direction_index + 1) % 6, x is updated by adding dx * steps to its original value, y is updated by adding dy * steps to its original value, _ is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, `steps` is not defined. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, `x` is updated by adding `dx * steps` to its original value, and `y` is updated by adding `dy * steps` to its original value. If `n` is less than `steps`, the function returns `x` which is `x0 + dx * n`, and `y` which is `y0 + dy * n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value - 2, `steps` is not defined, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, `x` and `y` are updated as follows: if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `x` is updated and `y` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the function returns `x + dx * n` and `y + dy * n`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
