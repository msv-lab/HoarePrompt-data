Output State: **n is less than steps, x is updated value, y is updated value, direction_index is unchanged, directions is unchanged, _ is 0**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the values of `dx` and `dy` from the `directions` list at the index `direction_index` to `dx` and `dy`.
- Then, it updates the value of `x` by adding `dx * n` to its current value.
- Similarly, it updates the value of `y` by adding `dy * n` to its current value.
- The variables `_`, `direction_index`, and `directions` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is less than `steps` remains valid after the code execution.
