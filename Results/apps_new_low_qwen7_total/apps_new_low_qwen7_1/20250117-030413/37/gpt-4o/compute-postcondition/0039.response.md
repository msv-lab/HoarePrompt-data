To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions under which the loop continues.

The loop condition is:
```python
while n > 0:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were given:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `steps` is 4.
- `direction_index` is the next index in the directions list after adding 1 and taking modulo 6.
- `x` is the original x value plus 8 times `dx` plus 3 times `dx`, and `y` is the original y value plus 8 times `dy` plus 3 times `dy` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, the function returns `x` as the original x value plus `dx` times `n` and `y` as the original y value plus `dy` times `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0. Given that `n` was initially greater than or equal to 1, and no operation within the loop body is explicitly changing the value of `n` (assuming the loop body does not alter `n`), `n` will remain greater than 0 unless it reaches 0 during the loop execution.

Since `n` is already greater than 0 at the start of the iteration and no operations in the loop body are specified that could change this condition, `n` will remain greater than 0 unless the loop body sets `n` to 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
