The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input and returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`. The function uses a set of predefined movement directions to update the coordinates `x` and `y` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it updates `x` and `y` by moving in different directions depending on the current step count and the remaining value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to the current step size, it moves in a full step in the current direction. Otherwise, it performs a partial step and then exits the function. After exiting the loop, the function returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` based on the accumulated movements.
