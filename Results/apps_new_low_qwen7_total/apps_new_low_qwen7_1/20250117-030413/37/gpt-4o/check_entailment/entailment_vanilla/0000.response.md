Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves Ayrat makes.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine Ayrat's final coordinates and prints them out.
3. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the coordinates based on the number of moves.
   - It initializes the starting position `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions in which Ayrat can move.
   - It uses a loop to handle the movement in a spiral pattern, incrementing the number of steps taken in each direction.
   - The key logic is in the nested loops and conditional checks within the `while` loop:
     - The outer loop (`for _ in range(2)`) alternates between moving in two different directions for each iteration.
     - The inner loop checks if there are enough moves left (`n >= steps`) to complete the full set of steps in the current direction.
     - If there are enough moves, it updates the position `(x, y)` and reduces `n` by the number of steps.
     - If not, it calculates the exact remaining steps and returns the updated position `(x, y)`.

Upon reviewing the implementation, we can confirm that the logic accurately simulates Ayrat's movement along the spiral path, and it correctly handles the case where the number of moves is not a multiple of the number of steps.

Given this analysis, the program should correctly determine Ayrat's final position after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
