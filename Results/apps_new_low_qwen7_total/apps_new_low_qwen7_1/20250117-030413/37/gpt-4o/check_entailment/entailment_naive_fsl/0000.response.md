Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement along the spiral path on the hexagonal grid. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the number of steps taken in each direction. According to the problem description, the spiral path on a hexagonal grid follows a pattern where the number of steps increases by 1 after each complete cycle of directions. However, the program incorrectly increments the step count only after completing both halves of a cycle.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`:
- The first half of the first cycle takes 1 step in each of the 6 directions.
- The second half of the first cycle takes 2 steps in each of the 6 directions.
- The first half of the second cycle takes 3 steps in each of the 6 directions.

The correct coordinates after 7 moves should be `(3, 2)`, but the provided program returns incorrect coordinates due to the incorrect handling of steps. This can be verified by manually following the path or using a correct implementation of the hexagonal spiral.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    steps = 1
    direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
                if n == 0:
                    break
            else:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return (x, y)
        steps += 1
    return (x, y)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of steps taken in each direction is accurately calculated and updates the position accordingly.
