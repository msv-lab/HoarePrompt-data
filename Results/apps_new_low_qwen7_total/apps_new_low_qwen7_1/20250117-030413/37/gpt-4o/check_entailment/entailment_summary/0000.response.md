Reasoning:

The provided program appears to correctly simulate Ayrat's movement on the hexagonal grid according to the specified rules. Let's break down the key aspects of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves.
2. **Movement Directions**: The program uses a list of directions defined as `[(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]` which covers all six possible directions in a hexagonal grid.
3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the movement steps in a loop.
   - It checks if the remaining moves (`n`) are sufficient for a full step or if only a partial step is needed.
   - It updates the coordinates `x` and `y` accordingly.
   - The direction index is updated after each full step to move to the next direction.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is exactly equal to the current step size, the program correctly performs a full step.
   - When `n` is less than the current step size, it performs a partial step and returns the result, which is consistent with the problem requirements.
5. **Final Return**: The function correctly returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` after all moves are processed.

Given the detailed execution summary and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program accurately simulates the movement and correctly calculates the coordinates after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
