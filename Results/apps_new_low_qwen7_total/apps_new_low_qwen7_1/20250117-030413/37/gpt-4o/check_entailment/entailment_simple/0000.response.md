Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the initial conditions and the direction changes as Ayrat moves in a spiral pattern across the hexagonal grid.
2. The `func_1` function iterates over the spiral movement, changing directions every step until it reaches or goes past `n` moves.
3. The logic for handling the remaining steps when `n < steps` inside the nested `for` loop is correctly implemented, ensuring that the exact position after `n` moves is calculated.
4. The program correctly updates the `x` and `y` coordinates based on the direction changes and the number of steps taken.
5. The final return statement ensures that the coordinates are returned accurately after the loop.

Given the above points, the program follows the correct algorithm for determining Ayrat's position after `n` moves on the hexagonal grid. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
