Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly handles the spiral movement pattern as described in the problem.
2. The directions list is properly initialized with the correct six directions for moving in a hexagonal grid.
3. The logic inside the `while` loop ensures that the movements are made according to the spiral pattern, with the correct handling of full and partial steps.
4. The directions index is correctly incremented every two full steps, ensuring the correct direction is followed.
5. The function correctly calculates the final position after `n` moves by considering both full and partial steps.
6. The function exits when `n` becomes non-positive, and the final coordinates are returned.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the implementation, the function appears to be implemented as intended.

Correctness: **True**
