### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves Ayrat makes.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine Ayrat's final coordinates and prints them out.
3. **Function Definition**:
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the coordinates based on the number of moves.
   - It initializes the starting position `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions in which Ayrat can move.
   - It uses a loop to handle the movement in a spiral pattern, incrementing the number of steps taken in each direction.
   - The key logic is in the nested loops and conditional checks within the `while` loop:
     - The outer loop (`for _ in range(2)`) alternates between moving in two different directions for each iteration.
     - The inner loop checks if there are enough moves left (`n >= steps`) to complete the full set of steps in the current direction.
     - If there are enough moves, it updates the position `(x, y)` and reduces `n` by the number of steps.
     - If not, it calculates the exact remaining steps and returns the updated position `(x, y)`.

Now let's examine the detailed behavior of the function and verify the logic:

- **Initial State**: The function starts with `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `direction_index = 0`.
- **Direction Cycles**: The directions are defined in a cycle of 6, and the function alternates between two directions for each iteration of the outer loop.
- **Steps Increment**: The number of steps increases by 1 with each iteration of the outer loop.
- **Movement Logic**:
  - In each iteration, the function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to the current `steps`.
  - If so, it performs a full step in the current direction and updates `x` and `y` accordingly.
  - If not, it performs a partial step and returns the result immediately.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation that affects the correctness:

- **Partial Step Calculation**: When `n < steps`, the function calculates the exact remaining steps but does not handle the case where the next direction change would occur. This means that the function might skip some steps in the next direction and return incorrect coordinates.

For example, consider `n = 7`:
- Initial steps = 1, direction = 0 (right).
- Full step in direction 0: `x = 1`, `y = 0`, `n = 6`, `direction_index = 1`.
- Full step in direction 1: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `n = 4`, `direction_index = 2`.
- Full step in direction 2: `x = -1`, `y = 1`, `n = 2`, `direction_index = 3`.
- Partial step in direction 3: `x = -1`, `y = 3`, `n = 0`.

The expected output for `n = 7` should be `(3, 2)`, but the actual output is `(-1, 3)` due to the incorrect handling of the partial step.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not correctly handle the partial steps and direction changes, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
