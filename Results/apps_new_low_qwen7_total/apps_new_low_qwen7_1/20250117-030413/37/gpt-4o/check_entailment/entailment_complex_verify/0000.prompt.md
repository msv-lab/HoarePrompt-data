You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: \( n \leq 0 \), \( steps \) is the last value before \( n \) became non-positive, \( direction_index = (original direction_index + 2 \times k) \% 6 \), \( x = x_{initial} + 8 \times (dx_1 + dx_2 + \ldots + dx_k) + n \times dx \), \( y = y_{initial} + 8 \times (dy_1 + dy_2 + \ldots + dy_k) + n \times dy \)
    return x, y
    #The program returns x and y, where \( x = x_{initial} + 8 \times (dx_1 + dx_2 + \ldots + dx_k) + n \times dx \) and \( y = y_{initial} + 8 \times (dy_1 + dy_2 + \ldots + dy_k) + n \times dy \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input and returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`. The function uses a set of predefined movement directions to update the coordinates `x` and `y` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it updates `x` and `y` by moving in different directions depending on the current step count and the remaining value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to the current step size, it moves in a full step in the current direction. Otherwise, it performs a partial step and then exits the function. After exiting the loop, the function returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` based on the accumulated movements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement along the spiral path on the hexagonal grid. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the number of steps taken in each direction. According to the problem description, the spiral path on a hexagonal grid follows a pattern where the number of steps increases by 1 after each complete cycle of directions. However, the program incorrectly increments the step count only after completing both halves of a cycle.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`:
- The first half of the first cycle takes 1 step in each of the 6 directions.
- The second half of the first cycle takes 2 steps in each of the 6 directions.
- The first half of the second cycle takes 3 steps in each of the 6 directions.

The correct coordinates after 7 moves should be `(3, 2)`, but the provided program returns incorrect coordinates due to the incorrect handling of steps. This can be verified by manually following the path or using a correct implementation of the hexagonal spiral.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    steps = 1
    direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
                if n == 0:
                    break
            else:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return (x, y)
        steps += 1
    return (x, y)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of steps taken in each direction is accurately calculated and updates the position accordingly.
