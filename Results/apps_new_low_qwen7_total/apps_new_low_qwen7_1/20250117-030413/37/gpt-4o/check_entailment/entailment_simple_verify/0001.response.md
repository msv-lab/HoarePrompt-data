### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves Ayrat makes.
   - This part is correct and well-handled.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine Ayrat's final coordinates and prints them out.
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the coordinates based on the number of moves.
   - **Initialization**:
     - It initializes the starting position `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions in which Ayrat can move.
   - **Spiral Movement Logic**:
     - The function uses a loop to handle the movement in a spiral pattern, incrementing the number of steps taken in each direction.
     - **Outer Loop** (`for _ in range(2)`):
       - This loop alternates between moving in two different directions for each iteration.
     - **Inner Loop** (`while n > 0`):
       - The inner loop checks if there are enough moves left (`n >= steps`) to complete the full set of steps in the current direction.
       - If there are enough moves, it updates the position `(x, y)` and reduces `n` by the number of steps.
       - If not, it calculates the exact remaining steps and returns the updated position `(x, y)`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Direction Handling**:
  - The directions are defined correctly as `[(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]`.
  - The `direction_index` is updated correctly every two iterations.

- **Movement Logic**:
  - The function correctly handles the movement in a spiral pattern, increasing the number of steps in each segment of the spiral.
  - The logic for reducing `n` and updating the position `(x, y)` is sound.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where the number of moves is not a multiple of the number of steps.
  - The function returns the exact coordinates after all moves are accounted for.

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the program appears to correctly simulate Ayrat's movement along the spiral path and accurately determine his final position after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
