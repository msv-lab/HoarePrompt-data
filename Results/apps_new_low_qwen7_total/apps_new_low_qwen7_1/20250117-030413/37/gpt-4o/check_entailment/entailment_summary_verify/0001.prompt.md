You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
-2 0

Input
7

Output
3 2

- Program:
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
    (x, y) = (0, 0)
    steps = 1
    direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                (dx, dy) = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return (x, y)
        steps += 1
    return (x, y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input and returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)`. The function uses a set of predefined movement directions to update the coordinates `x` and `y` based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it updates `x` and `y` by moving in different directions depending on the current step count and the remaining value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to the current step size, it moves in a full step in the current direction. Otherwise, it performs a partial step and then exits the function. After exiting the loop, the function returns the final coordinates `(x, y)` based on the accumulated movements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves Ayrat makes.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine Ayrat's final coordinates and prints them out.
3. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the coordinates based on the number of moves.
   - It initializes the starting position `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions in which Ayrat can move.
   - It uses a loop to handle the movement in a spiral pattern, incrementing the number of steps taken in each direction.
   - The key logic is in the nested loops and conditional checks within the `while` loop:
     - The outer loop (`for _ in range(2)`) alternates between moving in two different directions for each iteration.
     - The inner loop checks if there are enough moves left (`n >= steps`) to complete the full set of steps in the current direction.
     - If there are enough moves, it updates the position `(x, y)` and reduces `n` by the number of steps.
     - If not, it calculates the exact remaining steps and returns the updated position `(x, y)`.

Upon reviewing the implementation, we can confirm that the logic accurately simulates Ayrat's movement along the spiral path, and it correctly handles the case where the number of moves is not a multiple of the number of steps.

Given this analysis, the program should correctly determine Ayrat's final position after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
