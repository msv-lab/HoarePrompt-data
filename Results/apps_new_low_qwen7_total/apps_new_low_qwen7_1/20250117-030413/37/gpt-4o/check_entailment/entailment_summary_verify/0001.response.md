### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of moves Ayrat makes.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n)` to determine Ayrat's final coordinates and prints them out.
3. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the coordinates based on the number of moves.
   - It initializes the starting position `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions in which Ayrat can move.
   - It uses a loop to handle the movement in a spiral pattern, incrementing the number of steps taken in each direction.
   - The key logic is in the nested loops and conditional checks within the `while` loop:
     - The outer loop (`for _ in range(2)`) alternates between moving in two different directions for each iteration.
     - The inner loop checks if there are enough moves left (`n >= steps`) to complete the full set of steps in the current direction.
     - If there are enough moves, it updates the position `(x, y)` and reduces `n` by the number of steps.
     - If not, it calculates the exact remaining steps and returns the updated position `(x, y)`.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice a critical flaw in the logic:

- In the `for _ in range(2)` loop, the direction index is incremented even when `n < steps`. This means that the direction index will be incremented prematurely, leading to incorrect updates to the coordinates.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- If `n = 3`, the first iteration of the `while` loop will have `steps = 1`. The `for _ in range(2)` loop will be executed twice.
  - First iteration of the `for` loop: `direction_index = 0`, `dx = 1`, `dy = 0`
    - Since `n >= steps`, the coordinates will be updated as `(x, y) = (0+1*1, 0+0*1) = (1, 0)` and `n` becomes `2`.
  - Second iteration of the `for` loop: `direction_index = 1`, `dx = 0`, `dy = 1`
    - Since `n >= steps`, the coordinates will be updated as `(x, y) = (1+0*1, 0+1*1) = (1, 1)` and `n` becomes `1`.

At this point, `n` is no longer greater than or equal to `steps`, so the third iteration of the `for` loop (with `direction_index = 2`) will not be executed, and the function will return the incorrect coordinates `(1, 1)` instead of the correct coordinates `(-2, 0)`.

This premature incrementation of the direction index leads to incorrect coordinate updates, making the program incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the premature incrementation of the direction index in the `for _ in range(2)` loop.
