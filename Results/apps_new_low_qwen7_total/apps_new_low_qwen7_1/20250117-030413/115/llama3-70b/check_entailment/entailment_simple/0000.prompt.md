Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and $A$ is a $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1
                ] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is at least 2, m is at least 3, and `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\) and \(j\) in the range \([0, m - 2]\) if any of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) are equal to 1 for any \(i\) and \(j\). Otherwise, `ops` remains empty.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is a list of tuples representing valid operations, and the loop prints each tuple in `ops`. After the loop completes, `ops` is empty because all tuples have been printed, and no more valid operations exist. The final output state is that `ops` is empty, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.
        #
        #To summarize:
        #- **Invariant Variables**: None of the variables (`n`, `m`, or `ops`) change their state within the loop except for the consumption of `ops` entries.
        #- **Final Values**: 
        #  - `n`: At least 2 (unchanged)
        #  - `m`: At least 3 (unchanged)
        #  - `ops`: Empty (all tuples have been printed)
        #- **Conditions**: The loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is not empty. Once `ops` is empty, the loop stops executing.
        #
        #Thus, the final output state is:
        #Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is an empty list, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` is an empty list. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, then `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the loop executes `len(ops)` times and prints each tuple in `ops`, resulting in `ops` being empty by the end.
