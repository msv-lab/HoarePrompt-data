Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the matrix and the matrix \( A \) itself from the input.
2. **Operation Identification**: The program iterates through the matrix \( A \) to identify which \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices need to be set to all 1s. This is done by checking if any of the four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1. If any of them are 1, the program appends the coordinates \((i+1, j+1)\) to the list `ops`.
3. **Output Validation**: The program correctly checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If it does, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operationâ€™s coordinates.
4. **Loop Execution**: The loop executes as long as there are operations to perform. By the end of the loop, `ops` will be empty, and the correct number of operations is printed.
5. **Conditions and Constraints**: The constraints are handled correctly, ensuring that \( n \geq 2 \), \( m \geq 3 \), and the number of operations does not exceed 2500.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and handles all specified conditions and constraints appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
