Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each \(2 \times 2\) submatrix of the input matrix \(A\) and determining if an operation is needed. However, there are a few key issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if all four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are `1` before continuing to the next submatrix. This is unnecessary because the task is to make \(B\) equal to \(A\), not to skip certain submatrices where all elements are already `1`.

2. **Operation Identification**: The program correctly identifies positions where at least one element needs to be flipped from `0` to `1`. However, it should only append the operation if the current element in \(A\) is `1`, not based on the condition that any of the four elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix need to be flipped.

3. **Output Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the number of operations exceeds 2500 by printing `-1`. However, the logic to check if the matrix can be transformed correctly is flawed.

4. **Implementation of Operations**: The program should directly apply the necessary operations to transform \(B\) into \(A\) rather than just recording them. The current implementation only records the operations but does not actually perform them.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. The program fails to properly identify and record the necessary operations to transform \(B\) into \(A\).

Correctness: **False**
