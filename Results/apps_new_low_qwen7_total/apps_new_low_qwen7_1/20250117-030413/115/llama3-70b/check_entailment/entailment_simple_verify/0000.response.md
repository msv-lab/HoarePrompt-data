### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the issues in the provided code:

1. **Logic for Choosing Operations**:
   - The code iterates over all \(2 \times 2\) submatrices of \(B\) and appends an operation to `ops` if any of the four elements in the submatrix are 1. However, this logic does not ensure that the operations performed will transform \(B\) into \(A\).
   - For instance, consider the input:
     ```
     3 3
     1 1 1
     1 1 1
     0 1 1
     ```
     According to the problem, the expected sequence of operations is:
     ```
     3
     1 1
     1 2
     2 2
     ```
     But the given code would append operations for all four positions in the first row and column of \(B\), leading to an incorrect sequence of operations.

2. **Insufficient Handling of \(2 \times 2\) Submatrices**:
   - The code does not consider the dependencies between different \(2 \times 2\) submatrices. For example, setting a submatrix to all 1s might interfere with future operations needed to set other elements to 1.
   - The code does not account for the possibility that certain submatrices might already be set to 1 due to previous operations, which could lead to redundant operations.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The code only prints the number of operations and the coordinates of the operations. It does not ensure that the final state of \(B\) matches \(A\).
   - The check for `len(ops) > 2500` is just a limit on the number of operations and does not guarantee correctness.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to make matrix \(B\) equal to matrix \(A\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the transformation from matrix \(B\) to matrix \(A\) through the specified operations.
