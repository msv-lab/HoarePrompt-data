Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` remains unchanged. The condition checks if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. If true, the program remains in the same state as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the program does not change its state if the condition is false.***
