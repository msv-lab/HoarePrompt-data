Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( n \) is at least 2.
- \( j \) is 0.
- \( m \) is at least 3.
- \( ops \) contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( m - 2 \). Since the loop is just starting, `j` is currently 0. After one iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change it).
   
2. **Variable `m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged within the loop. It is a constant defined before the loop starts.

3. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop. It is a constant defined before the loop starts.

4. **List `ops`**: The list `ops` is checked and updated based on certain conditions involving matrix `A`. Since no information is given about changes to `ops` during the loop, we assume it remains as defined initially.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the first iteration of the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Given the initial value of `j` is 0, after one iteration, `j` will be 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
