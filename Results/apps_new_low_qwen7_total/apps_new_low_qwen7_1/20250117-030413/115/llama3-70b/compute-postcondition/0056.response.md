Postcondition: ***`A[i][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i + 1][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i][m]` and `A[i + 1][m]` are undefined, `ops` contains \((i + 1, m)\) and \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true. Otherwise, `A[i][m]` and `A[i + 1][m]` remain undefined and `ops` does not change.***
