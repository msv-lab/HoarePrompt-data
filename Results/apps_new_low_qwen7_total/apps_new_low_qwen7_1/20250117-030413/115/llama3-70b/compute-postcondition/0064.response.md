The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first and second elements of the list `op`. However, the values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code. The value of `ops` is mentioned to be non-empty, but no specific value is given for `op`. Since `op` is assumed to be the same as `ops` in the context of the print statement, the output will depend on the contents of `op`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `op`, we can only say that `op` is a non-empty list and the code will print the first and second elements of `op`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, and `op` is a non-empty list; the output of the print statement is the first and second elements of `op`.**
