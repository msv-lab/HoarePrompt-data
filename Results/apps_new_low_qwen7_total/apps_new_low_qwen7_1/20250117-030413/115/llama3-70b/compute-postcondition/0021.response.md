Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in this case is `j`.
   - The range of the loop is `range(m - 1)`, meaning `j` will iterate from 0 to `m - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`:**
   - According to the given initial state, `j` is set to `m - 1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(m - 1)`. This means `j` should be between 0 and `m - 2` (inclusive).

4. **Initial Value of `j` Relative to the Loop Condition:**
   - Given that `j` is initially set to `m - 1`, it is one value above the upper bound of the range `m - 2`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be decremented to be within the range `0` to `m - 2`.

5. **Ensure Other Variables Remain Unchanged:**
   - The other variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `ops` should remain as they were initially.

6. **State of the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be `m - 2` (the upper bound of the range).
   - All other variables should retain their initial values.

Based on the above reasoning, the required state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` remains unchanged**.
