The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if in a loop) and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the conditions and values of `n` and `m` stay the same.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` remains unchanged.**
