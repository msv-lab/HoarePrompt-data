Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged. The if condition does not change the values of `n`, `j`, `m`, or `ops` further since no modifications are specified within the if block.***
