Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, the program does not change any variables. Otherwise, the program does not change any variables.***
