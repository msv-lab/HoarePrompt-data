`ops` is a list, and the code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to it. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are `n - 1` and `m - 2` respectively. Therefore, the tuple added to `ops` is `((n - 1) + 1, (m - 2) + 1)`, which simplifies to `(n, m - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` is a list containing the element `[n, m - 1]`.**
