The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context given, the function seems to work with a matrix `A` which is an \( n \times m \) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and \( n \) and \( m \) are positive integers such that \( 2 \le n, m \le 50 \).

Given the constraints and relationships, the function likely processes this matrix and returns some specific value or result based on its content. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the input conditions.
