The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop context is provided, we assume that the `continue` statement does not affect any loop-related variables and simply moves to the next iteration if it was inside a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is at least 2
- `j` is 0
- `m` is at least 3
- `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions
- The following values are true: `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`

The `continue` statement does not modify any of these variables or conditions, so the values remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that if the `continue` statement was part of a loop, it would skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions, and the following values are true: `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1**
