You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and $A$ is a $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1
                ] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is at least 2, m is at least 3, and `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\) and \(j\) in the range \([0, m - 2]\) if any of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) are equal to 1 for any \(i\) and \(j\). Otherwise, `ops` remains empty.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is a list of tuples representing valid operations, and the loop prints each tuple in `ops`. After the loop completes, `ops` is empty because all tuples have been printed, and no more valid operations exist. The final output state is that `ops` is empty, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.
        #
        #To summarize:
        #- **Invariant Variables**: None of the variables (`n`, `m`, or `ops`) change their state within the loop except for the consumption of `ops` entries.
        #- **Final Values**: 
        #  - `n`: At least 2 (unchanged)
        #  - `m`: At least 3 (unchanged)
        #  - `ops`: Empty (all tuples have been printed)
        #- **Conditions**: The loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is not empty. Once `ops` is empty, the loop stops executing.
        #
        #Thus, the final output state is:
        #Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is an empty list, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` is an empty list. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, then `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the loop executes `len(ops)` times and prints each tuple in `ops`, resulting in `ops` being empty by the end.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function works with a matrix \( A \) which is an \( n \times m \) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and \( n \) and \( m \) are positive integers such that \( 2 \le n, m \le 50 \).

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
