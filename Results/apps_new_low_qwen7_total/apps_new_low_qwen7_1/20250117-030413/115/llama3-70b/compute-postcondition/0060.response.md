The code prints `-1`, which does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the output of `-1`. The conditions and values of `n`, `m`, and `ops` remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\) and \(j\) in the range \([0, m - 2]\) if any of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) are equal to 1 for any \(i\) and \(j\). Otherwise, `ops` remains empty. The length of `ops` is greater than 2500; `-1` is printed.**
