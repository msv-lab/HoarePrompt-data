The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `j`, `m`, and `ops` are unchanged, except that `ops` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\).

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\)**
