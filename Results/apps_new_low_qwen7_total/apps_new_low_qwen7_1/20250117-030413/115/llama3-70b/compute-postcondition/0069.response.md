Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is a list of tuples representing valid operations, and the loop prints each tuple in `ops`. After the loop completes, `ops` is empty because all tuples have been printed, and no more valid operations exist. The final output state is that `ops` is empty, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.

To summarize:
- **Invariant Variables**: None of the variables (`n`, `m`, or `ops`) change their state within the loop except for the consumption of `ops` entries.
- **Final Values**: 
  - `n`: At least 2 (unchanged)
  - `m`: At least 3 (unchanged)
  - `ops`: Empty (all tuples have been printed)
- **Conditions**: The loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is not empty. Once `ops` is empty, the loop stops executing.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `ops` is an empty list, and the loop has executed `len(ops)` times.
