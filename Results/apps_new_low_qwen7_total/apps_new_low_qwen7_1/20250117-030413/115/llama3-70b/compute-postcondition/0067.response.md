The only variables in the loop head are `op` and `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `op` and `ops`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 3
- `op` refers to the second element of `ops`
- `ops` must have at least two elements
- The output is the first and second elements of `ops`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `op` should refer to the third element of `ops`
- `ops` must have at least three elements (since it needs to have a third element for the next iteration)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `op` refers to the third element of `ops`, `ops` must have at least three elements, and the output is the first and second elements of `ops`.**
