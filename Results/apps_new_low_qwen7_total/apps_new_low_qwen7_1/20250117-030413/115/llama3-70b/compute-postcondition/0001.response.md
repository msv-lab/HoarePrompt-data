To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute even once, `n - 1` must be a positive integer (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).

2. **Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - The first iteration occurs when `i = 0`.
   - This means that the condition `n - 1 >= 0` must be satisfied for the loop to run at least once.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `n - 1` is always a positive integer (specifically, between 1 and 49).
   - Hence, `n - 1` is always a valid starting point for the loop.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `m`, `A`, and `ops` do not affect the execution of the loop based on the given range of `i`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the only condition we need to ensure is that `n` is at least 2 (since `n - 1` should be at least 1).

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` must be at least 2**. 

This ensures that `n - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
