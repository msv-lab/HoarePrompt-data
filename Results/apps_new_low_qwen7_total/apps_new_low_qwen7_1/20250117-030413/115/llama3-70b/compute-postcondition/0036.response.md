The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3` depending on the condition. After appending, the new value of `ops` will include this tuple.

Since the exact value of `j` depends on the condition which was not specified in the initial state, we will keep it in terms of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3` depending on the condition; `ops` contains the additional element `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
