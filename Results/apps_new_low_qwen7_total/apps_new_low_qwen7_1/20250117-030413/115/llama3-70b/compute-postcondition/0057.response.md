Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step-by-step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n`, where `n` is at least 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `ops` is initially an empty list.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
        continue
    if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
        ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `i` remains constant at `n`.
   - `j` ranges from 0 to `m - 2`.
   - `m` remains constant.
   - `ops` is appended to based on the conditions in the loop.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` from 0 to `m - 2`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1. If they are, the loop continues without adding anything to `ops`.
   - If any of these elements are 1, it appends `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - Since `i` remains constant at `n` and `j` ranges from 0 to `m - 2`, the only variable that changes is `ops`.
   - `ops` will contain tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all `j` where any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true.

### Summary
- **Constant Variables:**
  - `i` remains `n`.
  - `j` changes but is always within the range `[0, m - 2]`.
  - `m` remains at least 3.
- **Variable `ops`:**
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all `j` where the conditions are met.

### Output State After All Executions
Since the loop runs for each `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `ops` will contain tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all `j` where the conditions are met. Therefore, `ops` will be a list of all valid tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for `j` in the range `[0, m - 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` changes but is always within the range `[0, m - 2]`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains all valid tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for `j` in the range `[0, m - 2]` where the conditions are met.**
