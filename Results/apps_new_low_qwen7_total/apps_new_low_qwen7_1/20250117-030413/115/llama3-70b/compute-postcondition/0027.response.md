Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` remains unchanged. If `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `ops` remains unchanged and the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
