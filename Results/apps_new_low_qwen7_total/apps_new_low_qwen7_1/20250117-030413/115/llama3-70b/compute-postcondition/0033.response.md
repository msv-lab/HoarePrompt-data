Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(m - 1)`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `m - 1`.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)` if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is in the loop head, we need to update its value.
   - The loop `for j in range(m - 1)` will iterate from `0` to `m - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be updated to `m - 2`.

4. **Keep other states unchanged**: The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `ops` remain the same unless there is an explicit condition that changes them within the loop body, but no such condition is provided here.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)` if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
