Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- State before the loop starts:
  - `i` is `n`
  - `n` is at least 2
  - `j` is 0
  - `m` is at least 3
  - `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions.

- The for loop statement:
  ```
  for j in range(m - 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop condition is `j in range(m - 1)`.

2. **Determine Initial State of `j`:**
   - Initially, `j` is set to 0.

3. **Determine Initial State of `m`:**
   - Initially, `m` is at least 3.

4. **Evaluate the Range Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be within the range `range(m - 1)`.
   - This means `j` must satisfy `0 <= j < m - 1`.

5. **Initial Value of `j`:**
   - Initially, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `0` must be within the range `range(m - 1)`.

6. **Range Condition Verification:**
   - If `m` is at least 3, then `m - 1` is at least 2.
   - Therefore, `0` is always within the range `range(m - 1)` as long as `m` is at least 3.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `j` is initially 0 and `m` is at least 3, the initial state of `j` satisfies the condition `0 <= j < m - 1`.

### Final State:
- No additional adjustments are needed for `i`, `n`, or `ops` since they do not affect the loop's execution based on the given condition.
- The key states that must hold true are the initial values of `j` and `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions**. 

Since the loop condition is satisfied with the initial values, no further adjustments are required.
