The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `ops`, `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is at least 3, `ops` remains unchanged, `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1**
