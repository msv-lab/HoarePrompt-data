To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the requirements and conditions specified:

1. **Initialization Conditions**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `ops` contains tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\) and \(j\) in the range \([0, m - 2]\) if any of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) are equal to 1 for any \(i\) and \(j\).
   - `ops` is not empty (since an empty `ops` would prevent the loop from executing).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in `ops`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, there must be at least one element in `ops`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty when the loop begins. This means there must be at least one tuple in `ops`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `ops` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute, the only state that directly controls this is `ops`. Therefore, `ops` must be non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` is non-empty**
