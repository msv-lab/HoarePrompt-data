The code prints the length of the `ops` list. Since the `ops` list is constructed based on certain conditions involving the elements of the matrix `A`, and no changes are made to `ops` within the given code snippet, the value of `len(ops)` will remain as per the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the printed output which gives the length of `ops`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\) and \(j\) in the range \([0, m - 2]\) if any of the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i + 1][j]\), \(A[i][j + 1]\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1]\) are equal to 1 for any \(i\) and \(j\). Otherwise, `ops` remains empty. The length of `ops` is printed and is less than or equal to 2500; the value of `len(ops)` is printed.**
