The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, `i` and `j` are such that `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. The values of `n`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the operations involving `A` do not affect `n`, `j`, or `m`.

After executing the code, `ops` now contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be at least 3, `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
