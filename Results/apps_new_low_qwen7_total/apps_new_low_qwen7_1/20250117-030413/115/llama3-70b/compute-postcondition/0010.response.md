The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of `n`, `j`, `m`, or the contents of `ops`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
