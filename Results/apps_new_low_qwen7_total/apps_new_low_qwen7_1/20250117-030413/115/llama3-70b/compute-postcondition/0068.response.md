The code prints the first and second elements of `op`. Since the code only prints these elements and does not assign them to any other variables, the values of `n`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that `op` is used to print its first and second elements.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `op` refers to the third element of `ops`, `ops` must have at least three elements, and the output is printed as `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
