Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3` depending on whether the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is met. If the condition is true, `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)`. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged.**
