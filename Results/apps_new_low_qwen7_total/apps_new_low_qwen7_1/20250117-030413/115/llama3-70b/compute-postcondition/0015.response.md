The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but rather controls the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, no changes are made to the values of `n`, `j`, `m`, or `ops`. Therefore, the conditions and values remain as they were before the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
