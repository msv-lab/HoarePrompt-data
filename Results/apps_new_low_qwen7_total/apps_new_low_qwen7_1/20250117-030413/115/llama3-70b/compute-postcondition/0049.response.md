Precondition: `A` is a 2D array where `i` and `j` are valid indices.

Program Fragment:
```python
if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
```

If part: All four elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are equal to 1.

Else part: There is no else part in the code.

Postcondition: ***All four elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are equal to 1.***
