The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1, otherwise `ops` remains unchanged, the new tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) is appended to `ops`.

Since the condition for including the tuple in `ops` is not specified in the code snippet and the initial state does not provide explicit values for \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \), the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) will be added to `ops` regardless of these conditions, as the code does not depend on those conditions.

Thus, the updated state of `ops` is the original `ops` plus the new tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\).

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the original tuple plus the new tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\).**
