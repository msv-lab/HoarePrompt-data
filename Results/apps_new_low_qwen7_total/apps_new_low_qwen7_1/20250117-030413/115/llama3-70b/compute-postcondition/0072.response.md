Functionality: **The function processes a binary matrix \( A \) of size \( n \times m \) (where \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 3 \)) and identifies certain "valid" operations based on specific conditions. It then checks if the number of valid operations exceeds 2500. If it does, the function prints \(-1\); otherwise, it prints the count of valid operations followed by each valid operation's coordinates. After processing, the list of valid operations is emptied.**

**Detailed Steps:**
1. The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input, representing the dimensions of the matrix \( A \).
2. It reads the matrix \( A \) row by row from the input.
3. It iterates through each element of the matrix (excluding the last column and the last row) to check if a specific pattern of four adjacent elements forms a "valid" operation. The pattern involves checking if any of the following elements are 1: \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i+1][j] \), \( A[i][j+1] \), and \( A[i+1][j+1] \). If this condition is met, the coordinates \((i+1, j+1)\) are added to the list `ops`.
4. After identifying all possible valid operations, it checks if the length of `ops` exceeds 2500. If it does, the function prints \(-1\); otherwise, it prints the number of valid operations followed by each valid operation's coordinates.
5. Finally, the function prints nothing further and leaves the `ops` list empty.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the matrix \( A \) is very large (with \( n \) and \( m \) close to the upper limit of 50), the number of potential valid operations could approach 2500, triggering the \(-1\) output.
- If the matrix \( A \) is small (with \( n < 2 \) or \( m < 3 \)), the function will immediately terminate without performing any operations.
- If no valid operations are found, the function will print 0 and then print no valid operations' coordinates.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not provide any feedback or action if the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., \( n < 2 \) or \( m < 3 \)). This should ideally be handled to ensure robustness.
