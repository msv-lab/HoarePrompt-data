Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuples based on the conditions. If any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true, then the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` (or `(n + 1, 1)` if the conditions are met) is added to `ops`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ops`.***
