The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and considering the context provided, it implies that the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be at least 3. The elements A[i][j], A[i + 1][j], A[i][j + 1], and A[i + 1][j + 1] are all equal to 1.**
