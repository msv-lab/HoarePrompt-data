The provided code snippet reads the dimensions of an \(n \times m\) matrix and initializes the matrix \(A\), but it does not perform any operations on the matrix or assign any new values to variables outside of reading the input. Therefore, the only changes made are to the variables `n`, `m`, and `A`, which are updated based on user input. The list `ops` is initialized but remains empty since no operations are defined.

Given the initial state where \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(2 \le n, m \le 50\), and \(A\) is a \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either \(0\) or \(1\), the final output state will include the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `A`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer between 2 and 50, m is a positive integer between 2 and 50, A is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, ops is an empty list**
