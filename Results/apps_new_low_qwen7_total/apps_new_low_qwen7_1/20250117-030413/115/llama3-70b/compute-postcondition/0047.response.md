Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is at least 3
   - `ops` contains tuples based on specific conditions.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `m - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `1`.

Given that the loop starts with `j` as `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `1` for the next iteration. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, and `ops`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` remains `n`
- `n` remains at least 2
- `j` becomes `1`
- `m` remains at least 3
- `ops` remains unchanged based on the conditions

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuples based on the conditions.**
