Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- All four elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1.
- If any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, j + 1)\).
- Otherwise, no change in `ops`.

### Loop Statement
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable here is `j`. The loop iterates from `0` to `m - 2`.
2. **Effect of the Loop**: The loop body is not provided, but we know that it does something based on the condition involving the matrix elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \).

### Key Points
- The loop runs for each value of `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.
- After each iteration, the value of `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial State**:
   - \( A[i][j] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][j] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i][j + 1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1 \)
   - If any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, j + 1)\).

2. **After the First Iteration (j = 0)**:
   - \( A[i][0] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][0] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i][1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][1] = 1 \)
   - If any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, 1)\).

3. **General Case (j = k)**:
   - \( A[i][k] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][k] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i][k + 1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][k + 1] = 1 \)
   - If any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, k + 1)\).

4. **End of the Last Iteration (j = m - 2)**:
   - \( A[i][m - 2] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][m - 2] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i][m - 1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][m - 1] = 1 \)
   - If any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, m)\).

5. **Next Iteration (j = m - 1)**:
   - \( A[i][m - 1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i + 1][m - 1] = 1 \)
   - \( A[i][m] = \text{undefined} \) (out of bounds)
   - \( A[i + 1][m] = \text{undefined} \) (out of bounds)

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be set to `m - 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`A[i][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i + 1][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i][m] = undefined`, `A[i + 1][m] = undefined`, if any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, m)\)**.
