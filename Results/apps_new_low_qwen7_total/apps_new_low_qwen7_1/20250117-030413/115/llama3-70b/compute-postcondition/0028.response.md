Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `m - 2` (inclusive).

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `ops` remains unchanged.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < m - 1`.

4. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is currently `m - 2`.

5. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should become `m - 1`.

6. **Other States Remain Unchanged**:
   - `n`, `i`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` remains unchanged.**
