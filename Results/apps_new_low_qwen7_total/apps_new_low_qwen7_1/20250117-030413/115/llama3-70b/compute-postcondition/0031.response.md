`ops` is appended with the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` is `n - 1` and the value of `j` is `m - 1`. Therefore, the tuple added to `ops` is `((n - 1) + 1, (m - 1) + 1)`, which simplifies to `(n, m)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is at least 3, `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)`.**
