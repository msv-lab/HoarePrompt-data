Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `ops` contains the elements based on certain conditions.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. 

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `n`.
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `n`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `j` and `m` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `ops` remains unchanged since it does not depend on the loop head variables directly.

Given this analysis, the states that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is at least 2 (unchanged).
- `j` is 0 (unchanged).
- `m` is at least 3 (unchanged).
- `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't actually occur in this case) would be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the elements based on the conditions.**
