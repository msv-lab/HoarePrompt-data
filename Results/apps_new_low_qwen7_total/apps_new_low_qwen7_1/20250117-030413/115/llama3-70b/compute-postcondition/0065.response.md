Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head is `for op in ops:`. The variables mentioned in the loop head are `op` and `ops`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `ops` list. Since `op` is being used to iterate through each element of `ops`, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `ops`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `op` is a non-empty list (but note that `op` itself is an element of `ops`, not the entire `ops` list).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `ops` must have at least one more element after the current one.
   - Therefore, `ops` must have at least two elements left.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` and `m` are not directly involved in the loop condition, their values remain unchanged.
   - `op` will now refer to the second element of `ops`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `op` is a non-empty list and refers to the second element of `ops`, `ops` must have at least two elements**
