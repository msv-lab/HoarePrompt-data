The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since `j` was about to decrement to `m - 2`, the `continue` statement will skip this decrement and move `j` to the next value in the range, which is `m - 3`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)` if certain conditions are met, otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

After executing `continue`, the value of `j` will be updated to `m - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 3`, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the additional element `(n, m)` if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
