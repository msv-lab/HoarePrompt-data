Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop:**
   - The loop is controlled by two variables: `j` and `m - 1`.
   - The loop will run as long as `j < m - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be initialized to 0 (since `range(m - 1)` will generate numbers starting from 0 up to `m - 2`).

3. **Determine the initial state of `m - 1`:**
   - For the loop to execute at all, `m - 1` must be at least 1 (because if `m - 1` is 0 or less, the loop won't execute even once).
   - Given the initial state that `n` must be at least 2, we can infer that `m` must be at least 3 (since `m - 1` would then be at least 2).

4. **Combine the conditions:**
   - `n` being at least 2 doesn't directly affect the loop conditions involving `j` and `m - 1`, but it indirectly ensures that `m` is at least 3, which means `m - 1` is at least 2.

5. **Finalize the loop head conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be 0 and `m - 1` must be at least 1 (which is guaranteed by `m` being at least 3).

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time should be:

**State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be at least 3**
