The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop specified, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A[i][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i + 1][m - 1] = 1`, `A[i][m] = undefined`, `A[i + 1][m] = undefined`, if any of these elements are 1, `ops` contains the element \((i + 1, m)\)**
