Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is at least 2.
- `j` is 1.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` starts from 0 but since it is in the range `range(m - 1)`, it will iterate over values from 0 to \(m - 2\).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

### State Adjustments
- `n` does not change and remains at least 2.
- `j` changes to 2.
- `m` does not change and remains at least 3.
- `ops` remains unchanged unless there are specific conditions in the loop body that would modify it, but since no loop body is given, we assume `ops` stays the same.

### Final State
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and `ops` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if any of the elements \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are equal to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
