The function processes a binary matrix \( A \) of size \( n \times m \) (where \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 3 \)) and identifies certain "valid" operations based on specific conditions. It then checks if the number of valid operations exceeds 2500. If it does, the function prints \(-1\); otherwise, it prints the count of valid operations followed by each valid operation's coordinates. After processing, the list of valid operations is emptied.
