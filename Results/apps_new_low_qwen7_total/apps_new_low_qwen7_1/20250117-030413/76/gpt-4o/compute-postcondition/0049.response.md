The provided code block consists of two print statements. The first line prints 'YES', and the second line prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is at least 1
- The expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls`

After executing the first line of code, no variables are modified. The second line also does not modify any variables; it simply prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` is 1. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but we can denote it as `j`. Therefore, `j + 1` is `j + 1`.

No other variables are modified or have their values changed by the code block.

Output State: **i is 0, n is greater than 0, m is at least 1, row_walls[0] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[0][j] == '*' else 0) equals total_walls, j is unspecified, printed output is 'YES' and '1 j+1'**
