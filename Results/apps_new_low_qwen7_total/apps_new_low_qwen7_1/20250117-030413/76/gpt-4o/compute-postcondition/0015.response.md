The provided code snippet contains references to variables (`row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`) that are not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet itself. Additionally, the variable `i` is used in the first line of the code but is not defined anywhere. Given this information, it's not possible to determine the exact values of these variables or the specific changes they undergo. However, based on the operations described, we can infer the following:

- The line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the `row_walls` list by 1.
- The line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the `col_walls` list by 1.
- The line `total_walls += 1` increments the value of `total_walls` by 1.

Since the initial state only mentions that `m` must be greater than 1 and `j` is 1, and no other variables are mentioned, we can assume that `m` is related to either `row_walls` or `col_walls` but is not directly manipulated in the given code. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1. 

Given the lack of specific values for `row_walls` and `col_walls`, and since `j` is 1, the only definitive change is to `total_walls`.

Output State: **m is greater than 1, j is 1, total_walls is 1**
