Output State: **i is n - 1, n is greater than 0, grid is [data[index] to data[index + n - 1]], index is n, row_walls is [0] * m, col_walls is [0] * m, total_walls is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line initializes `row_walls` as a list of zeros with a length of `m`.
- The second line initializes `col_walls` as a list of zeros with a length of `m`.
- The third line initializes `total_walls` to 0.

These assignments do not affect the existing variables `i`, `n`, `grid`, or `index`. Therefore, they remain unchanged from their initial states.
