The provided code consists of two print statements:

1. `print('YES')`
2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`

Let's analyze each line:

1. The first print statement outputs the string 'YES'.
2. The second print statement outputs the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the code)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the code)
- `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls` (though this condition is not needed for the final state)

After executing the first line, no variables are updated or affected. After executing the second line, `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2 and `j` being 1.

Output State: **i is 2, j is 1, m must be greater than 0, n must be greater than 0**
