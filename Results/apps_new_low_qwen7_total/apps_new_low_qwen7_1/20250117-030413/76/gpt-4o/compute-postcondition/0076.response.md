Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 1 (not relevant for the loop condition)
   - `m` is greater than 0 (not relevant for the loop condition)
   - `n` is greater than 0 (not relevant for the loop condition)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and needs to be less than `n` for the loop to continue, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making it 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which is now 2.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i` becoming 2 and `n` must remain greater than 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2**
