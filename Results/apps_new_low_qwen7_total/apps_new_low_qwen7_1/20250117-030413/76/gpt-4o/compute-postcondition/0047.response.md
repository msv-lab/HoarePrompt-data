Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. 

3. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - The initial value of `j` is given as `0`.
   - The initial value of `n` (which is used to initialize `m`) must be greater than `0`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `m` at the start. Given that `j` starts at `0`, `m` must be at least `1`.

5. **State the Required Conditions**: 
   - `j` is initialized to `0`.
   - `m` must be at least `1` to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required state for the loop head is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1**.
