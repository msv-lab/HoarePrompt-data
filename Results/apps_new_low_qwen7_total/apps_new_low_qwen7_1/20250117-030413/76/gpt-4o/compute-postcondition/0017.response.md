The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 1 and `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 2. Since `m` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1, the condition for the loop to continue is satisfied.

State: **`m` is greater than 1 and `j` is 2**
