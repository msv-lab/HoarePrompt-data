Let's analyze the given code and the provided states step-by-step to determine the final output state after all executions of the loop.

### Initial State
- `i` is 1
- `j` is less than `m`
- `m` must be at least 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) != total_walls` holds for all `j` in `range(m)`

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. For each iteration, it checks the condition:
\[ \text{row\_walls}[i] + \text{col\_walls}[j] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) = \text{total\_walls} \]

If the condition is true, it prints `YES` followed by the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` and returns. If the condition is false, the loop continues to the next value of `j`.

### Output States Provided
1. **After 1 time:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The condition `row_walls[1] + col_walls[0] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[1][0] == '*' \text{ else } 0) = \text{total_walls}` is true

2. **After 2 times:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - If `row_walls[1] + col_walls[1] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[1][1] == '*' \text{ else } 0) = \text{total_walls}`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

3. **After 3 times:**
   - `i`, `j`, `m`, and `n` are integers.
   - If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) == \text{total_walls}` is true, no changes occur to the variables.
   - If the condition is false, no changes occur to the variables.

### Final Analysis
- From the provided states, we can see that the loop has executed exactly three times, and in the third iteration, the condition was false (since it did not change the variables).
- Therefore, the final state of the variables will be the same as after the third iteration.

### Final Output State
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- No changes to `row_walls`, `col_walls`, or `grid` are made

### Conclusion
Since the loop exits without further execution, the final state of the variables remains unchanged from the last valid state before the loop exited.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0.**
