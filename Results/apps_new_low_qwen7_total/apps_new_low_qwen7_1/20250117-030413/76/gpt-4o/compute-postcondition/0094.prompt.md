You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the number of rows and columns in the depot field. Following these, there are n lines, each containing m symbols "." and "*", representing the cells of the field where "." means an empty cell and "*" means a cell occupied by a wall.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

m = int(data[1])

grid = []

index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is n - 1, n is greater than 0, grid is [data[index] to data[index + n - 1]], index is n.
    row_walls = [0] * n

col_walls = [0] * m

total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `i` is `n - 1`
    #- `n` is greater than 0
    #- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
    #- `index` is `n`
    #- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `total_walls` is `0`
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n):
    #    for j in range(m):
    #        if grid[i][j] == '*':
    #            row_walls[i] += 1
    #            col_walls[j] += 1
    #            total_walls += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
    #   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
    #   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.
    #
    #2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
    #   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
    #   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
    #   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.
    #
    #### Summary of Loop Behavior:
    #- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
    #- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
    #- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #### Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
    #- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
    #- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
    #- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
    #- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = 0
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
