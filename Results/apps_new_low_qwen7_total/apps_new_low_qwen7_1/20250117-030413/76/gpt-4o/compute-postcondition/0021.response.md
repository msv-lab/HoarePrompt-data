Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i = n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, incrementing `i` to `n` would make `i >= n`, and the loop would terminate.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given that the loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented to `n`, we update `i` to `n`.

5. **Keep Other States Unchanged**: The other states (such as `m`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, and `total_walls`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `m` > 0, row_walls[i] is the count of '*' in the i-th row, col_walls[j] is the count of '*' in the j-th column for each j from 0 to m-1, and total_walls is the total count of '*' in the entire grid**.
