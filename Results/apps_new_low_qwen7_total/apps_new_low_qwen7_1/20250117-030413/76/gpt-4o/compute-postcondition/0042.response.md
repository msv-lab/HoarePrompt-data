The first line of code increments `row_walls[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 0 and `row_walls[0]` is the total count of `'*'` in the 0-th row plus 1, we increment `row_walls[0]` by 1. This means if there were originally `k` `'*'` characters in the 0-th row (making `row_walls[0] = k + 1`), after this line, it will become `k + 2`.

The second line increments `col_walls[j]` by 1 for a specific `j` which is given as `m`. Since `j` is set to `m` (the number of columns), `col_walls[m-1]` (since `col_walls` is indexed starting from 0) will have its value incremented by 1. Initially, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` represents the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column plus 1, so after this increment, the value of `col_walls[m-1]` will increase by 1.

The third line increments `total_walls` by 1. Initially, `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid plus 1, so adding 1 to `total_walls` simply increases its value by 1.

Given these updates and keeping all other conditions and values unchanged, the final state is:

Output State: **i is 0, m is greater than 0, row_walls[0] is the total count of '*' in the 0-th row plus 2, col_walls[m-1] is the total count of '*' in the (m-1)-th column plus 1, and total_walls is the total count of '*' in the entire grid plus 2.**
