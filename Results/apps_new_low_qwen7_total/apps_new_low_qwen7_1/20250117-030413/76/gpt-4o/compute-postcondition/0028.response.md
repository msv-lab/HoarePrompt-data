Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0. If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `j` becomes 2, `m` remains greater than 0, `row_walls[<index>]` is increased by 1, `col_walls[1]` is increased by 1, and `total_walls` is increased by 1. If `grid[i][j]` does not equal '*', `j` remains 1 and `m` remains greater than 0.***
