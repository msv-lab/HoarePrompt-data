Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(m)`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop Variables:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for j in range(m)` to execute the first time, the value of `m` must be at least 1 (since `range(m)` will generate numbers from 0 to `m-1`, and the loop will execute as long as `m > 0`).

4. **Consider the State of Other Variables:**
   - The variable `i` is not used inside the loop `for j in range(m)`, so its value (`n - 1`) does not directly affect whether the loop can execute.
   - `n` being greater than 0 ensures that `i` is valid, but it does not control the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the Required State:**
   - The loop `for j in range(m)` will execute the first time if `m` is greater than 0.

Based on this analysis, the required state for the loop head is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
