Output State: **j is 2, m must be greater than 0, row_walls[<index>] is increased by 1 again, col_walls[1] is increased by 1 again, total_walls is increased by 1 again**

Explanation:
- The initial state had `j` as 2, `m` greater than 0, `row_walls[<index>]` incremented by 1, `col_walls[1]` incremented by 1, and `total_walls` incremented by 1.
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increases the value of `row_walls[<index>]` by 1. Since `<index>` is not specified to be different from the previous increment, we assume it's the same index, so `row_walls[<index>]` is incremented again.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increases the value of `col_walls[1]` (since `j` is 2, but the code snippet uses 1-based indexing for `col_walls`) by 1. Again, since no new index is specified, we assume it's the same index, so `col_walls[1]` is incremented again.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increases the value of `total_walls` by 1. Since no new value is specified, `total_walls` is incremented again.

Thus, the final state retains the same structure as the initial state but with each affected variable incremented once more.
