Output State: **j is 1, m is greater than 0, row_walls[i] is the original value plus 1, col_walls[j] is the original value plus 1, total_walls is the original value plus 1, grid[i][j] is '*'**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value of `row_walls[i]` by 1.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value of `col_walls[j]` by 1.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the value of `total_walls` by 1.
- The value of `j` is updated to 1 (as it starts at 0 and is incremented).
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 is unchanged.
- The value of `grid[i][j]` remains '*', as the code block does not modify it.
