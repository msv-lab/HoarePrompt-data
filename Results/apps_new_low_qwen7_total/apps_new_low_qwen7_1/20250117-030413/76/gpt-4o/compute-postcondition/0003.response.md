Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head defines the variables that can change within the loop. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
   ```
   Therefore, the variables that can change are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `grid` is `[data[0]]`
   - `index` is 1

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, the next value of `i` would be 1. However, the value of `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

5. **Checking the Loop Condition**: After incrementing `i` to 1, the loop condition (`i < n`) will hold true if `n` is still greater than 1. Given that `n` was initially greater than 0, it must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`grid` and `index`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values should not be modified based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `grid` remains `[data[0]]`
- `index` remains 1

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `grid` is [data[0]], `index` is 1**
