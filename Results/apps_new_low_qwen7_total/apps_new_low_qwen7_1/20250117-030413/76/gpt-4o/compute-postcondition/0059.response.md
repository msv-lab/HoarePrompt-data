Postcondition: ***`i`, `j` are indices such that `i` and `j` start at 1, assuming `j` was 0 before. `m`, `n`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `grid`, and `total_walls` maintain their initial values. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds, the program does not return any value. If the condition does not hold, the program also does not return any value.***
