Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `grid[i][j]` remains unchanged. If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `j` is set to 1, `row_walls[i]` is incremented by 1, `col_walls[j]` is incremented by 1, `total_walls` is incremented by 1, and `grid[i][j]` is set to '*'. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
