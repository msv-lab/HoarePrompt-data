Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - The condition for `grid[i][j]` is checked within the loop body.
     - If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then:
       - `j` becomes 2
       - `m` remains greater than 0
       - `row_walls[<index>]` is increased by 1
       - `col_walls[1]` is increased by 1
       - `total_walls` is increased by 1
     - If `grid[i][j]` does not equal '*', then:
       - `j` remains 1
       - `m` remains greater than 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must become 2 (as it would then be less than `m`).
   - `m` must remain greater than 0.
   - `row_walls[<index>]` must be increased by 1.
   - `col_walls[1]` must be increased by 1.
   - `total_walls` must be increased by 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be 2.
- `m` must remain greater than 0.
- `row_walls[<index>]` should be increased by 1.
- `col_walls[1]` should be increased by 1.
- `total_walls` should be increased by 1.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `row_walls[<index>]` is increased by 1, `col_walls[1]` is increased by 1, `total_walls` is increased by 1**.
