Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop in question is `for j in range(m):`. This means the loop variable is `j`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `j` from `range(m)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.

4. **Verify the conditions**:
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls` should hold true for `j = 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls`**
