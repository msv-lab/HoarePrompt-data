Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop variable is `i` and it iterates from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `grid` is [10, 20]
   - `index` is 2

3. **Determine the next iteration conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `grid` and `index` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
