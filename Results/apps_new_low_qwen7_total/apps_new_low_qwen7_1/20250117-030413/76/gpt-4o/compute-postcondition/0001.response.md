Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop is controlled by the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` is the loop index, and `n` is the range parameter.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(n)` means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is the number of rows (a positive integer).
   - `m` is the number of columns (a positive integer).
   - `grid` is an empty list.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0 because `range(n)` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the first iteration of the loop must satisfy the following conditions:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state of the objects at the start of the loop head must be:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
