Output State: **i is 1, m is greater than 0, row_walls[0] is the total count of '*' in the 0-th row plus 2, col_walls[j] for each j from 0 to m-1 is the total count of '*' in the j-th column plus 2 for each j, and total_walls is the total count of '*' in the entire grid plus 2. Moreover, j is now m**

Explanation:
1. The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value of `row_walls[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `row_walls[0]` is incremented by 1, changing its value to the total count of `'*'` in the 0-th row plus 2.
2. The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value of `col_walls[j]` by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`. This means each element in `col_walls` (from index 0 to `m-1`) is incremented by 1, changing their values to the total count of `'*'` in the corresponding column plus 2.
3. The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the value of `total_walls` by 1, changing its value to the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid plus 2.

The variable `j` is set to `m` by the last line, but since the question asks to list the impact on the program's state, it's important to note this change as well.
