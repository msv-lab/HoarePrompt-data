Output State: **i is the same as the previous iteration, j is j + 2, m is greater than 0, n is greater than 2, print statements executed** 

Explanation: 
- The first line `print('YES')` prints "YES" to the console.
- The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console. It does not modify any variables.
- The initial state shows that `j` is `j + 1`. After executing the print statement, `j` is effectively `j + 2` because the print statement increments `j` by 1. 
- Other variables `i`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
