Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `m`, and `n` are integers. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is true, then no changes occur to the variables. If the condition is false, then no changes occur to the variables.*** 

In this case, since both the if and else parts do not mention any changes to the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
