You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `index` is `n`
- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `total_walls` is `0`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] == '*':
            row_walls[i] += 1
            col_walls[j] += 1
            total_walls += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.

### Final Values:
- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.

### Output State:
- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
