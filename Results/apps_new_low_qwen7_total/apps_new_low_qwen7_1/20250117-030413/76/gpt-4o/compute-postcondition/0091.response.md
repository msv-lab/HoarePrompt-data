Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is a positive integer
- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `index` is `n`
- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `total_walls` is `0`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
            print('YES')
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            return
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
   - The loop checks if `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the indices `(i+1, j+1)` and returns immediately.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated based on the presence of `'*'` in the grid.
   - `total_walls` is updated as elements are added to `row_walls` and `col_walls`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
- The loop will check the condition for each element in the grid and print the coordinates if the condition is met.

### Final Values:
- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
- `n` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
- `row_walls` and `col_walls` will contain the counts of `'*'` in each row and column, respectively.
- `total_walls` will contain the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute up to `n * m` times (one for each cell in the grid).
- It will exit early if the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is met for any cell `(i, j)`.

### Output State:
- **Output State**: 
  - `i = 0`
  - `m > 0`
  - `n > 0`
  - `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` for the cell that causes the loop to return (if it exits early).
  - `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` contains the count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column.
  - `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
  - The loop may not execute if no cell satisfies the condition, in which case it will simply return without printing anything.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **i = 0**, **m > 0**, **n > 0**, **row_walls[0] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[0][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls** for the cell that causes the loop to return (if it exits early), **col_walls[j]** for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` contains the count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and **total_walls** is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
