Postcondition: ***`i`, `j` are indices, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds true, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains as the precondition since there are no changes specified in the else part.***
