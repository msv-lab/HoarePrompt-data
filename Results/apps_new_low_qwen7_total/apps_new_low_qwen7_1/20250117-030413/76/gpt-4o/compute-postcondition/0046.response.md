Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `index` is `n`
- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `total_walls` is `0`

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The variable `i` starts with the value `n - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(n)`.
   - For the first iteration of the loop, `i` must be within the range `range(n)`.

3. **Range of `range(n)`:**
   - The `range(n)` function generates integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the first value that `i` can take is `0` (the smallest integer in the range).

4. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `n - 1`, it will decrement by 1 on each iteration of the loop.
   - To reach `i = 0` on the first iteration, we need `n - 1` to be `0` or more.

5. **Ensuring `n` is Greater Than 0:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute even once, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0` and `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State Before the First Iteration:
- `i` must be `0`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Output:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
