Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `row_walls[0]` is the total count of `'*'` in the 0-th row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid. The current value of `grid[i][j]` is '*', meaning `grid[0][j]` is '*'**
