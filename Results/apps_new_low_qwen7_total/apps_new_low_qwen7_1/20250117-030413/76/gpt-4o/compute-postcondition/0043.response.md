Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[0]` is the total count of `'*'` in the 0-th row plus 2, `col_walls[m-1]` is the total count of `'*'` in the (m-1)-th column plus 1, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid plus 2. This is true if `grid[i][j]` is '*', otherwise, the original values of `row_walls[0]`, `col_walls[m-1]`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged.***
