The first line prints 'YES' to the console. This line does not modify any variables.

The second line prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`, which are 2 and 3 respectively, to the console. After executing this line, the values of `i` and `j` are not changed; they remain as 1 and 2, respectively. 

The precondition states that `m` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. These conditions are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **i is 1, j is 2, m must be greater than 0, n must be greater than 0**
