Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `index` is `n`
- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `total_walls` is `0`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] == '*':
            row_walls[i] += 1
            col_walls[j] += 1
            total_walls += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.

### Final Values:
- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.

### Output State:
- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
            ) == total_walls:
            print('YES')
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            return


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls` for all `j` in `range(m)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: i is 2, j is the index where the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds true, m is 0, n is greater than 2.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
