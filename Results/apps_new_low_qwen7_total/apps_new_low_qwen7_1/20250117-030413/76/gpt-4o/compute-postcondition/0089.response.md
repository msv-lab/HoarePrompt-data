Postcondition: ***`i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 2. If the condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` holds true, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, the program continues without any specified changes to the variables.***
