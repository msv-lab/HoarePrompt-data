Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
- `index` is `n`
- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
- `total_walls` is `0`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if grid[i][j] == '*':
            row_walls[i] += 1
            col_walls[j] += 1
            total_walls += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.

### Final Values:
- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.

### Output State:
- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
