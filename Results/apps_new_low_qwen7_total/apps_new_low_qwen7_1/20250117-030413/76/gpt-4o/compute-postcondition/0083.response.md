Output State: **i is 3, j is 2, m must be greater than 0, n must be greater than 2, and (row_walls[3] + col_walls[2] - (1 if grid[3][2] == '*' else 0) != total_walls)**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints "YES" to the console but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console, which are 3 and 2 respectively. This does not modify any variables either.
- The initial conditions state that `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, and the condition `(row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) != total_walls)` holds true. After the code execution, `i` is incremented to 3 and `j` is incremented to 2, while the other conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `i` and `j`, and the other conditions still hold true.
