The given code consists of two print statements. Let's break down the impact of each line:

1. `print('YES')`: This line prints the string 'YES' to the console.
2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`: This line prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console.

Since the initial state is `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the values to be printed will be:

- For `i + 1`: `1 + 1 = 2`
- For `j + 1`: `0 + 1 = 1`

Therefore, the output will be:

```
YES
2 1
```

Now, let's compile the final state based on the provided code execution:

- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged at 0.
- The values of `m`, `n`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `grid`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged.
- The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` remains unaffected because no operations were performed on these variables within the code block.

The final output state will include the unchanged variables along with the printed output. 

Output State: **i is 1, j is 0, m, n, row_walls, col_walls, grid, total_walls maintain their initial values, printed output is 'YES' and 2 1**
