The first line of the code appends the value at `data[index]` to the `grid` list. Given the initial state where `index` is 1, `data[index]` refers to the second element of `data`. The second line increments `index` by 1. 

Given that the initial state includes `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `grid` is `[data[0]]`, and `index` is 1, let's assume `data` is a list. For the sake of this example, let's assume `data = [10, 20, 30]`. (Note: The actual content of `data` is not provided, but we can use this assumption for clarity.)

Initially:
- `i` = 1
- `n` > 1
- `grid` = [10]
- `index` = 1

After executing the first line:
- `grid` becomes `[10, 20]` because `data[index]` (which is `data[1]` or 20) is appended to `grid`.

After executing the second line:
- `index` becomes 2.

Since no other variables are modified and the condition for `n` is only checked initially, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 1, grid is [10, 20], index is 2**
