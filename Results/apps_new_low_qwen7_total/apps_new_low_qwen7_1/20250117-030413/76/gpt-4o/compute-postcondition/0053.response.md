Output State: **i is 1, j is 0, n must be greater than 0, m must be at least 1, row_walls[0] + col_walls[1] - (1 if grid[0][1] == '*' else 0) is not equal to total_walls**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints 'YES' but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Since `i` is initially 0 and `j` is not defined in the initial state but is used here, it implies `j` is implicitly 0 (as no other value is provided). Therefore, it prints '1 1'. This line also does not modify any variables.

The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `row_walls[0] + col_walls[1] - (1 if grid[0][1] == '*' else 0)`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code execution.
