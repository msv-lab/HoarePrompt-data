The only object in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m-1`.

Since `m` must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `m` is 1. Therefore, if `j` is currently 0 (the smallest possible starting value), for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**.
