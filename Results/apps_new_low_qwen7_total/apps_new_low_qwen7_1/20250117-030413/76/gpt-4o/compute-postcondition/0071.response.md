Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- The condition for the function to return `None` is: `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`.
- Since `j` starts at `1` in the initial state, the loop will execute for `j` values from `1` to `m-1`.

### Adjusting States
At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2.

### Conditions to Check
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

### Updated State
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` becomes 2.
- `m` must remain greater than 0.
- `n` must remain greater than 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
