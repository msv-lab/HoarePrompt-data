Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `grid[i][j]` remains unchanged.
   - If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', specific actions are performed (setting `j` to 1, incrementing counters, etc.).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will execute as long as `j < m`, the first iteration sets `j` to 1 (since `j` was 0 initially).
   - Given that `m` is greater than 0, the loop can still execute.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be set to 1.
- `m` remains the same (greater than 0).

4. **Adjust the State**:
- The variable `j` needs to be updated to 1.
- The variable `m` does not change, so it remains greater than 0.

Thus, the state adjustments are:
- `j` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).

Final State:
**`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0**.
