Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n`
- `m` > 0
- `row_walls[i]` is the count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row
- `col_walls[j]` is the count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`
- `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - On the first iteration, `j` will be `0`.

2. **Condition for Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < m`.
   - Since `j` starts at `0` and `m` is greater than `0`, the condition `j < m` will be true for the first iteration.

### Variables Involved:
- `j`: This is the only variable explicitly mentioned in the loop header.
- `m`: This is used to determine the upper limit of the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be `0` and the condition `j < m` must be true.

### State After Adjustments:
- `j` should be `0`.
- `m` must be greater than `0` to ensure the loop can start.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
