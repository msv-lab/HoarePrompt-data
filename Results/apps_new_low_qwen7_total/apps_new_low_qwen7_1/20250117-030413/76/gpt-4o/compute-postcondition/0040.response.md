Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row_walls[0]` is the total count of `'*'` in the 0-th row plus 1, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column plus 1 for each `j`, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid plus 1. Moreover, `j` is now `m`. If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `row_walls[0]` is incremented by 1 and `col_walls[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
