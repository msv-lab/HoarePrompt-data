    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `i` is `n - 1`
    #- `n` is greater than 0
    #- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
    #- `index` is `n`
    #- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `total_walls` is `0`
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n):
    #    for j in range(m):
    #        if grid[i][j] == '*':
    #            row_walls[i] += 1
    #            col_walls[j] += 1
    #            total_walls += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
    #   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
    #   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.
    #
    #2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
    #   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
    #   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
    #   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.
    #
    #### Summary of Loop Behavior:
    #- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
    #- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
    #- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #### Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
    #- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
    #- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
    #- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
    #- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = 0
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a depot field from standard input, which is represented as a grid of characters where '.' denotes an empty cell and '*' denotes a cell occupied by a wall. It then counts the number of walls in each row and each column, as well as the total number of walls. The function checks if there is a cell that, when removed, would result in the total wall count being equal to the sum of the row and column wall counts for that cell minus one (if the cell is a wall). If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input grid is empty or contains invalid dimensions. The function does not handle these cases explicitly and may raise an error if the input does not meet the specified constraints.
