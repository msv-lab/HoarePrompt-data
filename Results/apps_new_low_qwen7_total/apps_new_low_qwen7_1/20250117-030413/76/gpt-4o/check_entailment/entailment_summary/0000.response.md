Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input string at once using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into components, and parses the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Grid Construction**: It constructs the grid and separately tracks the number of walls in each row (`row_walls`) and column (`col_walls`).
3. **Total Walls Calculation**: It calculates the total number of walls in the grid (`total_walls`).
4. **Checking Possibility**: For each cell \((i, j)\), it checks if the sum of the walls in row \(i\) and column \(j\) minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. If this condition is met, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the cell, then exits.
5. **Handling No Solution**: If no such cell is found, it prints "NO".

The program follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately and handles the necessary calculations and checks. There are no obvious errors in the logic flow or calculations.

Given the execution summary aligns with the problem requirements and the provided code accurately implements the described logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
