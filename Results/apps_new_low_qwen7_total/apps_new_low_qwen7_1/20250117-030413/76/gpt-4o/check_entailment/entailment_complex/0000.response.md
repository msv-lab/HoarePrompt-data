### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It initializes `row_walls` and `col_walls` to keep track of the number of walls in each row and column, respectively.
   - `total_walls` is initialized to count the total number of walls in the grid.

2. **Counting Walls:**
   - The nested loops iterate through each cell in the grid to update `row_walls`, `col_walls`, and `total_walls`.

3. **Checking for Valid Bomb Placement:**
   - The subsequent nested loops check if there exists a cell `(i, j)` such that the sum of the walls in row `i` and column `j` minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - This condition is checked using the expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`.

4. **Output:**
   - If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` (1-indexed).
   - If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program handles the case where the grid might be empty or contain invalid dimensions implicitly by the nature of the loop conditions.
- The program ensures that the bomb placement condition is met for both empty and wall cells.

### Conclusion:
The given program logic is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. It correctly identifies whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing a single bomb in a valid position.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
