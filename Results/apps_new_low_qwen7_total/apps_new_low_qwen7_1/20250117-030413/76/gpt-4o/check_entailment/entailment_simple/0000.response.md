### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into components.
   - It initializes the grid and counts the number of walls in each row and column.

2. **Counting Walls**:
   - The nested loops correctly count the number of walls in each row and column and store them in `row_walls` and `col_walls` respectively.

3. **Determining Feasibility**:
   - The logic in the nested loop checks if placing a bomb at position `(i+1, j+1)` would result in all walls being removed.
   - Specifically, it checks if the sum of walls in the current row and column minus one (if the current cell is a wall) equals the total number of walls. This condition ensures that placing a bomb at this position will remove all walls in the specified row and column.

4. **Output**:
   - If such a position is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates.
   - If no such position exists, the program prints "NO".

Given the logical steps and the correct implementation of the required checks, the provided code accurately determines whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb.

### Conclusion:
The correctness of the provided code is validated by the logical steps and the accurate implementation of the required conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
