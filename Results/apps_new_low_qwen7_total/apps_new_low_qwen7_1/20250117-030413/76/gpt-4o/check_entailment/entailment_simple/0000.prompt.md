Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the number of rows and columns in the depot field. Following these, there are n lines, each containing m symbols "." and "*", representing the cells of the field where "." means an empty cell and "*" means a cell occupied by a wall.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

m = int(data[1])

grid = []

index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is n - 1, n is greater than 0, grid is [data[index] to data[index + n - 1]], index is n.
    row_walls = [0] * n

col_walls = [0] * m

total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `i` is `n - 1`
    #- `n` is greater than 0
    #- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
    #- `index` is `n`
    #- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `total_walls` is `0`
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n):
    #    for j in range(m):
    #        if grid[i][j] == '*':
    #            row_walls[i] += 1
    #            col_walls[j] += 1
    #            total_walls += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
    #   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
    #   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.
    #
    #2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
    #   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
    #   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
    #   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.
    #
    #### Summary of Loop Behavior:
    #- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
    #- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
    #- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #### Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
    #- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
    #- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
    #- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
    #- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = 0
    print('NO')
