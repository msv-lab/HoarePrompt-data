You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `i` is `n - 1`
    #- `n` is greater than 0
    #- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
    #- `index` is `n`
    #- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `total_walls` is `0`
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n):
    #    for j in range(m):
    #        if grid[i][j] == '*':
    #            row_walls[i] += 1
    #            col_walls[j] += 1
    #            total_walls += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
    #   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
    #   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.
    #
    #2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
    #   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
    #   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
    #   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.
    #
    #### Summary of Loop Behavior:
    #- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
    #- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
    #- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #### Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
    #- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
    #- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
    #- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
    #- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = 0
    print('NO')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input grid is empty or has dimensions larger than 1000x1000, although the problem statement specifies that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). However, the primary issue is with the logic to determine if it's possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb.

The logic in the program checks if the sum of walls in the row and column minus the overlap (if any) equals the total number of walls. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the placement of the bomb in a way that would actually clear all walls. For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

In this case, the program would output "YES" and suggest placing the bomb at (1, 1), but the correct answer should be "NO" because no single bomb can clear all walls.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check three conditions:
1. There must be at least one row with only walls.
2. There must be at least one column with only walls.
3. The intersection of this row and column should have either no walls or a single wall.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    
    # Check if there exists a row and a column with all walls
    for i in range(n):
        if row_walls[i] == m and col_walls[i] == 1:
            print("YES")
            print(i + 1, col_walls[i])
            return
    for j in range(m):
        if col_walls[j] == n and row_walls[j] == 1:
            print("YES")
            print(row_walls[j], j + 1)
            return
    
    print("NO")

func_1()
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic and should provide the correct output for all valid inputs.
