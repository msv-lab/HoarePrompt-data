### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the grid data into the `grid` list.

2. **Counting Walls**:
   - The program correctly initializes `row_walls` and `col_walls` arrays to count the number of walls in each row and column, respectively.
   - It iterates through the grid to update these counts and also keeps track of the total number of walls in `total_walls`.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - For each cell, it checks if the condition \( \text{row\_walls}[i] + \text{col\_walls}[j] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[i][j] == '*') == \text{total\_walls} \) holds true.
     - This condition ensures that placing a bomb at cell \((i, j)\) would wipe out all walls in row \(i\) and column \(j\), effectively clearing all walls if this condition is met.
   - If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of that cell and returns, indicating that a solution exists.
   - If no such cell is found after checking all cells, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is not possible to clear all walls with one bomb.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is empty or contains only empty cells (no walls).
   - The condition check accounts for the presence or absence of walls in the current cell.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement requirements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis of the program and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The conditions are correctly checked, and the output is formatted appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
