Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input, parsing the dimensions of the grid and then the grid itself.
2. **Counting Walls**: The program correctly counts the number of walls in each row and column.
3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks whether placing a bomb at each cell would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by verifying if the sum of walls in the respective row and column minus the wall at the cell (if present) equals the total number of walls.
4. **Output**: If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of that cell. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

Correctness: **True**
