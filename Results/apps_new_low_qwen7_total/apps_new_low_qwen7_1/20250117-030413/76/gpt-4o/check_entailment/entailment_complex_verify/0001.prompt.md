You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Following these, there are n lines, each containing m symbols "." and "*", representing the cells of the field where "." means an empty cell and "*" means a cell occupied by a wall.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `i` is `n - 1`
    #- `n` is greater than 0
    #- `grid` is a list of lists containing elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
    #- `index` is `n`
    #- `row_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `col_walls` is `[0] * m`
    #- `total_walls` is `0`
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(n):
    #    for j in range(m):
    #        if grid[i][j] == '*':
    #            row_walls[i] += 1
    #            col_walls[j] += 1
    #            total_walls += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The outer loop iterates `n` times over the rows.
    #   - The inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
    #   - For each element `grid[i][j]` that is '*', it increments `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, and `total_walls`.
    #
    #2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by the outer loop until it reaches 0.
    #   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `m` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `row_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each row.
    #   - `col_walls` is updated based on the presence of '*' in each column.
    #   - `total_walls` is incremented each time an '*' is encountered.
    #
    #### Summary of Loop Behavior:
    #- After `n` iterations of the outer loop, `i` will be 0.
    #- The loop will increment `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]` for every '*' in the grid.
    #- `total_walls` will accumulate the total count of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #### Final Values:
    #- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
    #- `m` will remain as its initial value since it is not modified.
    #- `row_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each row, starting from the last row and moving upwards.
    #- `col_walls` will contain the count of '*' in each column.
    #- `total_walls` will contain the total count of '*' in the entire grid.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- **Output State**: `i = 0`, `m > 0`, `row_walls[i]` is the total count of `'*'` in the `i`-th row plus the number of times the loop iterates over that row, `col_walls[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `m-1` is the total count of `'*'` in the `j`-th column, and `total_walls` is the total count of `'*'` in the entire grid.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = 0
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a depot field from standard input, which is represented as a grid of characters where '.' denotes an empty cell and '*' denotes a cell occupied by a wall. It then counts the number of walls in each row and each column, as well as the total number of walls. The function checks if there is a cell that, when removed, would result in the total wall count being equal to the sum of the row and column wall counts for that cell minus one (if the cell is a wall). If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input grid is empty or contains invalid dimensions. The function does not handle these cases explicitly and may raise an error if the input does not meet the specified constraints.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input, parsing the dimensions of the grid and then the grid itself.
2. **Counting Walls**: The program correctly counts the number of walls in each row and column.
3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks whether placing a bomb at each cell would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by verifying if the sum of walls in the respective row and column minus the wall at the cell (if present) equals the total number of walls.
4. **Output**: If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of that cell. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.
