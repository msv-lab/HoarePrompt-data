### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in the `grid` list.
   - This part is correct and handled well.

2. **Counting Walls**:
   - The program correctly initializes `row_walls` and `col_walls` with zeros.
   - It iterates through each cell in the grid and updates the counts of walls in the corresponding row and column.
   - The `total_walls` variable is also correctly incremented whenever a wall is encountered.
   - This part is correct and handles the counting logic accurately.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if placing a bomb at a specific cell (i.e., a cell with walls) would result in all walls being wiped out.
   - It does this by verifying if the sum of walls in the respective row and column minus one (if the cell is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in this condition check. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the presence of a wall at the cell being checked can be ignored in the condition check, which is not always true.

   Specifically, the condition:
   ```python
   if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
   ```
   This condition is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the wall at the cell being checked (if it exists) does not contribute to the total wall count. In reality, if the cell is a wall, it should be included in the total wall count.

4. **Output**:
   - If the program finds a cell that satisfies the condition, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of that cell.
   - If no such cell is found, it prints "NO".
   - The output handling is correct.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is incorrect because the condition check is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the wall at the cell being checked can be ignored in the condition check, which leads to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
