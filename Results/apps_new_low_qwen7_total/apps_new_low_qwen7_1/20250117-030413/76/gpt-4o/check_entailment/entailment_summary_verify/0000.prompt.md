You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
.*..
....
.*..

Output
YES
1 2

Input
3 3
..*
.*.
*..

Output
NO

Input
6 5
..*..
..*..
*****

Output
YES

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
    print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a depot field from standard input, which is represented as a grid of characters where '.' denotes an empty cell and '*' denotes a cell occupied by a wall. It then counts the number of walls in each row and each column, as well as the total number of walls. The function checks if there is a cell that, when removed, would result in the total wall count being equal to the sum of the row and column wall counts for that cell minus one (if the cell is a wall). If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input grid is empty or contains invalid dimensions. The function does not handle these cases explicitly and may raise an error if the input does not meet the specified constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input grid is empty or has dimensions larger than 1000x1000, although the problem statement specifies that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). However, the primary issue is with the logic to determine if it's possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb.

The logic in the program checks if the sum of walls in the row and column minus the overlap (if any) equals the total number of walls. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the placement of the bomb in a way that would actually clear all walls. For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

In this case, the program would output "YES" and suggest placing the bomb at (1, 1), but the correct answer should be "NO" because no single bomb can clear all walls.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check three conditions:
1. There must be at least one row with only walls.
2. There must be at least one column with only walls.
3. The intersection of this row and column should have either no walls or a single wall.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    
    # Check if there exists a row and a column with all walls
    for i in range(n):
        if row_walls[i] == m and col_walls[i] == 1:
            print("YES")
            print(i + 1, col_walls[i])
            return
    for j in range(m):
        if col_walls[j] == n and row_walls[j] == 1:
            print("YES")
            print(row_walls[j], j + 1)
            return
    
    print("NO")

func_1()
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic and should provide the correct output for all valid inputs.
