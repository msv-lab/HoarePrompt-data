Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input, parsing the dimensions of the grid and then the grid itself. This part is accurate and follows the input format described in the problem statement.

2. **Counting Walls**: The program correctly counts the number of walls in each row and column. This is done using `row_walls` and `col_walls` lists, which track the number of walls in each row and column respectively. This step is also correct.

3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks whether placing a bomb at each cell would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by verifying if the sum of walls in the respective row and column minus the wall at the cell (if present) equals the total number of walls. However, there is a logical flaw in this condition. Specifically, the formula used in the loop:
   ```python
   if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
   ```
   is not quite right. The condition should ensure that the walls in the row and column combined (excluding the wall at the cell if it exists) match the total walls minus the wall at the current cell if it is a wall. The correct condition should be:
   ```python
   if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0):
   ```
   Without this adjustment, the condition might incorrectly identify some cells as valid when they are not.

4. **Output**: If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of that cell. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The output handling is correct.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment missed the critical logical error in the condition checking. The program does not correctly account for the wall at the cell when checking the condition. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect due to this flaw.

Final: **False**
