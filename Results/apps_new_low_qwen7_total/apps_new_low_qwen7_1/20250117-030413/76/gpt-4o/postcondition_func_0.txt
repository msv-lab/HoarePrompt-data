The function reads a depot field from standard input, which is represented as a grid of characters where '.' denotes an empty cell and '*' denotes a cell occupied by a wall. It then counts the number of walls in each row and each column, as well as the total number of walls. The function checks if there is a cell that, when removed, would result in the total wall count being equal to the sum of the row and column wall counts for that cell minus one (if the cell is a wall). If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input grid is empty or contains invalid dimensions. The function does not handle these cases explicitly and may raise an error if the input does not meet the specified constraints.
