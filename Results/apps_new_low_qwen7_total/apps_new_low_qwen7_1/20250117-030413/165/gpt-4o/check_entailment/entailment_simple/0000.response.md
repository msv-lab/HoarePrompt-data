Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and initializes variables.
2. The function `func_1` checks several conditions to ensure that Robo-Wallace can potentially score a goal:
   - Checks if the ball is too close to the wall or if the wall is too close to the goal posts.
   - Ensures that the goal's midpoint is within the field boundaries.
   - Calculates the x-coordinate (`x_w`) where the ball should be kicked to hit the wall and then bounce towards the goal.
3. The calculations are performed under the assumption that the ball bounces elastically and follows the laws of reflection.
4. The final check ensures that `x_w` is positive, meaning the calculated point is within the field bounds.
5. The program returns `-1` if any condition fails, indicating that Robo-Wallace cannot score under the given constraints.
6. The example outputs align with the expected behavior of the program.

Given the logical structure and the checks implemented, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
