Reasoning:  
The provided code appears to address the problem correctly based on the execution summary. Here are the key points:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the ball can score a goal by bouncing off the right wall and going into the goal.
2. The function returns `-1` under several specific conditions that prevent the ball from scoring:
   - If the ball is too close to the top wall (`yb + r >= yw`).
   - If the walls are incorrectly ordered (`y1 >= y2`).
   - If the ball is too close to the top wall due to the radius (`y1 + r >= y2 - r`).
   - If the goalpost is too close to the bottom or top wall (`y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`).
   - If the calculated `x_w` is not positive (`x_w <= 0`).
3. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates and returns the correct `x_w` using the given formula.

Given the constraints and the conditions checked, the function behaves as expected according to the problem statement. The output matches the requirements described in the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
