### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly checks if the ball is within the bounds for scoring. Specifically, it ensures `yb + r < yw` and `y1 < y2 < yw`. These conditions are checked appropriately.
   - However, the condition `y1 + r >= y2 - r` is unnecessary and can be removed. This condition is overly restrictive and does not affect the solution's correctness since the ball must be below the wall (`yb + r < yw`) and the wall must be between the goal posts (`y1 < y2`).

2. **Goal Post Boundaries Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the midpoint of the goalposts is within the height range where the ball could bounce and still reach the goal. This is done via `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`, ensuring the ball won't overshoot the goal after bouncing.
   - This check is correct and necessary to ensure the ball can indeed reach the goal after bouncing off the wall.

3. **Calculation of Target X-coordinate**:
   - The formula used to calculate the target x-coordinate, `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`, is derived from the principles of reflection. This formula correctly calculates the point on the right wall from which the ball would bounce and reach the goal.
   - The formula assumes that the ball is kicked horizontally (along the x-axis) and reflects off the wall at the same angle it hits it. Given the right wall is vertical, the calculation is correct.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - The program correctly returns `-1` if the calculated `x_w` is invalid (i.e., less than or equal to 0). Otherwise, it prints `x_w` formatted to 10 decimal places.
   - The check `x_w <= 0` is necessary to ensure the ball does not hit the left wall or the goalpost.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and the annotated code, we can confirm that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the target x-coordinate for the ball to bounce off the right wall and score a goal. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and requirements.
