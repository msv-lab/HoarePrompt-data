Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the ball's initial position is such that the calculated aiming point would result in the ball hitting the goal post or the left wall before reaching the right wall. Specifically, the calculation of `x_w` does not ensure that the ball bounces off the right wall and then directly into the goal. 

Consider the following input:
```
4 10 13 10 3 1
```
According to the problem description, the correct output should be `4.3750000000`. However, the current implementation calculates `x_w` based on the assumption that the ball will bounce off the right wall and go directly into the goal, without considering the constraints of the field geometry and the exact path of the ball. 

The program should check if the calculated `x_w` results in the ball touching the goal post or the left wall before reaching the right wall. If such a scenario exists, the program should return `-1`.

Here is an example of a failing case:
- Given the input `4 10 13 10 3 1`, the program calculates `x_w` as `4.375`, but it does not verify whether this point ensures that the ball bounces off the right wall and goes directly into the goal without touching any other part of the wall or the goal post. This is a potential case where the program fails to meet the problem description.
