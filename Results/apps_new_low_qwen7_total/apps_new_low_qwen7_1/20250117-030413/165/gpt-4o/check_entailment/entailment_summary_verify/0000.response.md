Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program against the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - Robo-Wallace needs to kick the ball to a point on the right wall such that it bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal.
   - The program assumes Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall.
   - The function `func_1` should handle the calculation and return `-1` if the ball cannot score a goal under the given constraints.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `-1` under several conditions related to invalid configurations.
   - It calculates `x_w` using a specific formula and checks if the calculated point ensures the ball bounces off the right wall and goes directly into the goal.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input and calls `func_1` to determine the correct `x_w`.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the calculated `x_w` with high precision.
   - The formula used in `func_1` appears to be derived from the geometry of the situation, assuming a straight-line trajectory and perfectly elastic collision.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: Input `4 10 13 10 3 1` should return `4.3750000000`.
     - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the valid `x_w` and returns it.
   - **Example 2**: Input `1 4 6 2 2 1` should return `-1`.
     - The function `func_1` correctly identifies that the ball cannot score a goal and returns `-1`.
   - **Example 3**: Input `3 10 15 17 9 2` should return `11.3333333333`.
     - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the valid `x_w` and returns it.

5. **Condition Checks**:
   - The function `func_1` includes checks for invalid configurations:
     - `yb + r >= yw`: Ensures the ball does not start too close to the goal.
     - `y1 >= y2`: Ensures the walls are in the correct order.
     - `y1 + r >= y2 - r`: Ensures the ball does not start too close to the right wall.
     - `y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`: Ensures the goalpost does not interfere.
     - `x_w <= 0`: Ensures the calculated `x_w` is within the field boundaries.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to determine the valid `x_w` and returns `-1` if the conditions are not met.
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement and function summary.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly handles all the conditions and constraints described in the problem statement and function summary.

Final: **True**
