### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program checks `yb + r < yw` to ensure the ball is below the goal height.
   - It checks `y1 < y2 < yw` to ensure the goalpost boundaries are valid.
   - These checks are correct and necessary.

2. **Goal Post Boundaries Check**:
   - The program calculates `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2` and checks `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`.
   - This ensures the ball will bounce within the goal height range and can reach the goal.
   - The condition `y1 + r >= y2 - r` is also checked, which is redundant since it is already covered by `y1 < y2` and `y1 + r < y2 - r`.

3. **Calculation of Target X-coordinate**:
   - The formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` is derived from the reflection property of the ball.
   - Given the ball's initial position `(xb, yb)` and the wall midpoint `(y_goal_mid)`, the formula correctly computes the x-coordinate on the right wall where the ball should be kicked.
   - The formula ensures the ball will hit the wall and bounce to the goal.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - The program checks `x_w <= 0` to ensure the target x-coordinate is valid.
   - If `x_w` is invalid, the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `x_w` formatted to 10 decimal places.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - The program correctly handles boundary conditions and returns `-1` if the ball cannot score.
  
- **Mathematical Correctness**:
  - The formula for calculating the target x-coordinate is mathematically sound and correctly applies the reflection property.

- **Formatting and Precision**:
  - The output is formatted to 10 decimal places as required.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all cases as per the problem description and constraints. The logic and calculations are mathematically sound and correctly implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
