Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly checks if the ball is within the bounds for scoring. Specifically, it ensures `yb + r < yw` and `y1 < y2 < yw`. These conditions are checked appropriately.
2. **Goal Post Boundaries Check**: The program correctly checks if the midpoint of the goalposts is within the height range where the ball could bounce and still reach the goal. This is done via `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`, ensuring the ball won't overshoot the goal after bouncing.
3. **Calculation of Target X-coordinate**: The formula used to calculate the target x-coordinate, `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`, seems correct for finding the point on the right wall from which the ball would bounce and reach the goal.
4. **Final Validation**: The program correctly returns `-1` if the calculated `x_w` is invalid (i.e., less than or equal to 0). Otherwise, it prints `x_w` formatted to 10 decimal places.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the solution appears to handle all cases correctly as per the provided instructions.

Correctness: **True**
