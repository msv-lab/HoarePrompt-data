Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the ball can hit the right wall and bounce into the goal without hitting other parts of the wall or goalposts.
2. The function first validates the input constraints to ensure that the ball can theoretically reach the right wall and bounce into the goal.
3. The calculations in the function are based on the physics of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
4. The formula used to calculate `x_w` (the abscissa of the point of aiming) is derived from the reflection principle.
5. The function returns `-1` if the ball cannot hit the right wall and bounce into the goal according to the given constraints.
6. The state transitions and conditional checks in the function are logically consistent with the problem statement.

Given the logical consistency and correctness of the function implementation, the program as annotated is correct.

Correctness: **True**
