Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts six integers `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r` with specific constraints and returns `-1` in three cases and a value `x_w` in the fourth case. Specifically, the function calculates `x_w` using the formula `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` where `y_goal_mid` is the midpoint between `y1` and `y2`. The function returns `-1` if any of the following conditions are met:
1. `yb + r >= yw`
2. `y1 >= y2`
3. `y1 + r >= y2 - r`
4. `y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`
5. `x_w <= 0`.

If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `x_w`, which is guaranteed to be greater than 0.**

This summary covers all potential edge cases and the missing logic is included as per the actual code execution.
