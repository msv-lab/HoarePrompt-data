The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. All of these parameters are integers, and they satisfy the following constraints: `y1, y2, yw > 0`, `y1 < y2 < yw`, `yb + r < yw`, `2 * r < y2 - y1`, and `r > 0`.

The function has four return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `-1`.
- Case_2: The function returns `-1`.
- Case_3: The function returns `-1`.
- Case_4: The function returns `x_w`, which is calculated as `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`, and `x_w` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r` under specific constraints and return `-1` in three cases and `x_w` in the fourth case, where `x_w` is calculated based on the given formula and is required to be greater than 0.
