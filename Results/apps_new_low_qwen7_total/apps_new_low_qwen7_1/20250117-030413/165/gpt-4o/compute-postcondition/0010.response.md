Postcondition: **`y1` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `yw` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `y_goal_mid` is an integer such that `y1 < y_goal_mid < y2` and `y_goal_mid - r >= y1` and `y_goal_mid + r <= y2`, `x_w` is `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`, and `x_w > 0`**
