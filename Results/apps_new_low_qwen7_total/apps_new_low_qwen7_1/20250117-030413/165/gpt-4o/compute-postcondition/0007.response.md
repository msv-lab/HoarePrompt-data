`x_w` is assigned the value of `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`. We know that `y1 < y_goal_mid < y2` and `y_goal_mid - r >= y1` and `y_goal_mid + r <= y2`. However, the specific values of `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, `r`, and `y_goal_mid` are not provided, so we express the calculation in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`y1` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `yw` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `y_goal_mid` is an integer such that `y1 < y_goal_mid < y2` and `y_goal_mid - r >= y1` and `y_goal_mid + r <= y2`, `x_w` is `xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`**
