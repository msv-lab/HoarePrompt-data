Postcondition: **`y1` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `yw` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `y_goal_mid` is an integer such that `y1 < y_goal_mid < y2`. The current value of `y_goal_mid - r` is less than `y1` or the current value of `y_goal_mid + r` is greater than `y2`.**
