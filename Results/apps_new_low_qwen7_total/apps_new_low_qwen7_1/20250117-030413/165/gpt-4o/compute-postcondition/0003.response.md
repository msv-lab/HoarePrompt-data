The code assigns the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2` to the variable `y_goal_mid`. Since `y1` and `y2` are known to be integers and `y1 < y2`, the value of `y_goal_mid` will be the average of `y1` and `y2`. However, since the division of two integers results in an integer in Python, the result will be truncated to the nearest lower integer if necessary.

Given the conditions `y1 < y2 < yw`, the value of `y_goal_mid` will be an integer between `y1` and `y2`.

The states of the other variables (`yb`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y1` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `yw` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `y_goal_mid` is an integer such that `y1 < y_goal_mid < y2`**
