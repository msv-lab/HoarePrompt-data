The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list is either 1 or -1, and there are `n` integers in the list where `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`. The function does not return an error message but rather a specific value based on the conditions provided. Since no specific return value is mentioned other than the conditions, we need to consider the possible return values derived from the conditions.

However, given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it seems the function might be calculating something based on the list of integers. But without more specific information about the exact calculation or condition, we can only state the input parameters and acknowledge that the function returns a specific value based on those parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and the length of the list `n` satisfies `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`. It returns a specific value based on the list of integers.**
