Output State: **`b` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` < 100, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` for any `b` from 1 to `n` where the indices satisfy `(i - b) % k != 0`**
