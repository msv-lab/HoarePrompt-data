Output State: **b is 2, i is 2, n is greater than or equal to 1, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in tabs from index 1 to n-1, e is 1 (if tabs[0] is 1), e is 0 (if tabs[0] is -1), s is 1 (if tabs[0] is -1), s is 0 (if tabs[0] is 1), and (i - b) % k is not equal to 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the `tabs` list is 1. Since `i` is 1 initially, `i - 1` is 0. If `tabs[0]` is 1, `e` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
2. The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the `tabs` list is -1. Again, since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0. If `tabs[0]` is -1, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Since `i` is 1, both conditions will check `tabs[0]`. Depending on the value of `tabs[0]`, `e` and `s` will be updated accordingly. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
