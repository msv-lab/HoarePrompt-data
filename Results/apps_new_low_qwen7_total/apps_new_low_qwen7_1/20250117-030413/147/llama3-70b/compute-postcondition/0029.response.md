Let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop variable `b` is being iterated from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `b` is 2
  - `i` is `n`
  - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
  - `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
  - `e` is the sum of 1s in `tabs` where the index satisfies \((i - 2) \% k \neq 0\)
  - `s` is the sum of -1s in `tabs` where the index satisfies \((i - 2) \% k \neq 0\)

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop variable `b` is being incremented in each iteration, starting from 1 up to `n`.

### Current Iteration:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2.
- For the next iteration, `b` will be increased by 1, making it `b = 3`.

### Adjusting States:
- Since the loop only changes the value of `b`, the other variables (`i`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, `s`) should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

### New State:
- The only variable that changes is `b`, which will now be `3`.
- All other variables retain their previous values: `i` is still `n`, `tabs` remains the same, `max_diff` is unchanged, `e` is unchanged, and `s` is unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`b` is 3, `i` is `n`, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is the sum of 1s in `tabs` where the index satisfies \((i - 2) \% k \neq 0\), `s` is the sum of -1s in `tabs` where the index satisfies \((i - 2) \% k \neq 0\)**
