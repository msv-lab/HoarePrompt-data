Output State: **b is 3, i is 2, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the new value of abs(e - s), e is 1, s is -1**

Explanation:
- The initial state is: `b` is 3, `i` is 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers (each integer is either 1 or -1), `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is 0, `s` is 0.
- The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true, so the two lines of code are executed.
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if `tabs[0]` (since `i - 1` is 0) is equal to 1 and adds 1 to `e` if it is. Since `tabs[0]` can be either 1 or -1, we consider both possibilities. However, the exact value of `tabs[0]` isn't specified, but we know that initially `e` is 0, so if `tabs[0]` is 1, `e` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if `tabs[0]` is equal to -1 and adds -1 to `s` if it is. Similarly, if `tabs[0]` is -1, `s` becomes -1; otherwise, it remains 0.
- Given the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true, we proceed with these updates. After the updates, `i` becomes 2 (as `i` is incremented implicitly when the condition is met).
- Therefore, the final state is: `b` is 3, `i` is 2, `tabs` remains unchanged, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `e` is 1 (if `tabs[0]` was 1) or 0, and `s` is -1 (if `tabs[0]` was -1) or 0. For simplicity and since the exact value of `tabs[0]` wasn't specified, we assume the worst-case scenario where `tabs[0]` is -1, leading to `e` being 1 and `s` being -1.
