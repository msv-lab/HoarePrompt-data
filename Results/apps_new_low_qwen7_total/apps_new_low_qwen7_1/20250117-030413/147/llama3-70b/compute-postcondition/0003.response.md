Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop uses the variable `i` which ranges from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive), but the loop condition is `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to `1`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` starts at `1`, the condition `i <= n` must be true.

4. **Identify other relevant variables**: Other variables like `b`, `n`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. However, they might affect the loop body. 

5. **State the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - `i` must be `1`.
   - `n` must be an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` (where `k` seems to be a typo and should be `n`).
   - `b`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, and `s` can remain in their initial states as no specific conditions are given that relate them directly to the loop's execution.

Based on this analysis, the state before the first execution of the for loop should be:

State: **`b` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n < 100`, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**
