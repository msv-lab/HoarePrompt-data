Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `b` is 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100.
   - `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
   - `max_diff` is 0.
   - `e` is 1 if `tabs[2] == 1` else 0.
   - `s` is 1 if `tabs[2] == -1` else 0.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` holds true.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` and `(i - b) % k != 0` must hold true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` was 3, in the next iteration, `i` will become 4.
   - The value of `n` does not change unless specified otherwise inside the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` must still hold true for the next iteration. Given `b` is 1, this means `(4 - 1) % k != 0`, i.e., `3 % k != 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is updated to 4 and `n` remains unchanged.
   - Other variables like `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, and `s` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 1 if `tabs[2] == 1` else 0, `s` is 1 if `tabs[2] == -1` else 0, and the condition (i - b) % k != 0 holds true.**
