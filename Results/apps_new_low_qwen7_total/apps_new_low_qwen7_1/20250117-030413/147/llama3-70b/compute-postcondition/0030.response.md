The code initializes `e` and `s` to 0. This directly sets the values of `e` and `s` without changing the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `b`, `i`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, along with the updated values of `e` and `s`.

Output State: **`b` is 3, `i` is `n`, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**
