Postcondition: **`b` is 3, `i` is 3, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is either 1 or 0 plus the value of `tabs[2]`, `s` is either -1 or 0 plus the negative of the value of `tabs[2]`, if `(i - b) % k != 0`.**
