Postcondition: ***`b` is 3, `i` is either 2 or 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is either 1 or 0, `s` is either -1 or 0. If `(i - b) % k != 0`, then `i` is 2, `e` is 1, and `s` is -1. Otherwise, `i` remains 1, and `e` and `s` are adjusted based on the values in the `tabs` list such that `max_diff` is updated accordingly.***
