Postcondition: ***`b` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `e` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[3]` is 1, `e` remains unchanged if `tabs[3]` is -1, `s` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[3]` is -1, `s` remains unchanged if `tabs[3]` is 1.***
