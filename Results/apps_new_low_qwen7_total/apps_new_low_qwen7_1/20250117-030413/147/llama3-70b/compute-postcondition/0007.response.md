The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive), and given the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` holds true, `n` remains unchanged as long as `i` is within the valid range.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`b` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, and the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` holds true.**
