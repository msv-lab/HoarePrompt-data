Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will start when `i` is 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `b` is 2.
   - `i` is initially `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n < 100\).
   - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
   - `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `s` is 0.

4. **Determine the Required State for the First Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1 (since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` in each iteration).
   - The condition `i <= n` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Given the initial values:
- Initially, `i` is `n`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 1 while ensuring the loop condition still holds true.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` should be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `i` is 1 and `i <= n`).

So, the required state for the first execution of the loop is:

State: **`b` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**.
