Output State: **b is 2, i is 3, n is greater than or equal to 1, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in tabs from index 1 to n-1, e is 2 if tabs[2] is 1, e is 1 if tabs[2] is -1, s is 1 if tabs[2] is -1, s is 2 if tabs[2] is 1, (i - b) % k is not equal to 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `b` is 2, `i` is 3, and `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
- The variable `max_diff` is defined based on the conditions given in the initial state.
- The variable `e` is initially set to 1 if `tabs[0]` is 1, otherwise it is 0.
- The variable `s` is initially set to 0 if `tabs[0]` is 1, otherwise it is 1.
- The first line of the code increments `e` by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is 1. Since `i` is 3, we are checking `tabs[2]`.
- The second line of the code increments `s` by 1 if `tabs[i - 1]` is -1. Again, since `i` is 3, we are checking `tabs[2]`.

Thus, the values of `e` and `s` depend on the value of `tabs[2]`:
- If `tabs[2]` is 1, then `e` becomes 2 and `s` becomes 1.
- If `tabs[2]` is -1, then `e` becomes 1 and `s` becomes 2.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
