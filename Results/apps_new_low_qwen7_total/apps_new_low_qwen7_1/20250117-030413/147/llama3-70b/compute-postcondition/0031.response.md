Let's break down the task step-by-step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `b` is 3
- `i` is `n`
- `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
- `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
- `e` is 0
- `s` is 0

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, the loop will start executing when `i` is equal to 1.

2. **Checking the Initial Value of `i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Determining the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to enter its first iteration, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - Specifically, `i` must transition from `n` to 1, which means `i` must decrement to 1 for the loop to start.

4. **Ensuring Valid Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and the loop condition requires `i` to be in the range `[1, n]`, `i` must decrement from `n` to 1 for the loop to start.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute its first time, `i` must be decremented from `n` to 1. The other variables (`b`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, `s`) do not directly control the loop execution and remain unchanged for the initial state.

### Final State:
- `b` is 3
- `i` is 1 (decremented from `n` to 1)
- `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
- `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
- `e` is 0
- `s` is 0

Thus, the state for the first iteration of the loop is:
**State: **`b` is 3, `i` is 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**
