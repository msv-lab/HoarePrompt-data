Postcondition: ***`b` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `e` is 2 if `tabs[2]` is 1, `e` is 1 if `tabs[2]` is -1, `s` is 1 if `tabs[2]` is -1, `s` is 2 if `tabs[2]` is 1, `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0.***

Explanation: The if condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is always false according to the precondition `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the if part is never executed, and the else part is also not provided, meaning the values of `b`, `i`, `n`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, `s`, and `(i - b) % k` remain unchanged.
