Postcondition: **`b` is 3, `i` is 4, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`. If `(i - b) % k != 0`, then `e` is 2 + `x` if `tabs[3]` is 1, otherwise `x`, and `s` is -`x` if `tabs[3]` is -1, otherwise -1 - `x`. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where `(i - b) % k == 0`.**
