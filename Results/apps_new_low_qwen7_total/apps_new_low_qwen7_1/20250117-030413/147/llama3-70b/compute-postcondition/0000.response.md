The given code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1. It then initializes a variable `max_diff` to 0. However, the code does not proceed to calculate or update `max_diff` with any values, so the value of `max_diff` remains 0 after the input operations.

Since no further operations are performed on `n` or `k`, their values remain unchanged. The list `tabs` is populated with the input values, and `max_diff` is left at its initialized value of 0.

Given the constraints 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, we know that `n` and `k` are within these bounds, but without specific input values, we cannot provide exact numerical values for them. Therefore, the final output state reflects the known variables and their unaltered values.

Output State: **n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is 0**
