The code initializes `e` and `s` to 0. This resets the counts of 1s and -1s in the `tabs` list, respectively. The values of `b`, `i`, `n`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, and `s` (the count of -1s) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`b` is 2, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n < 100\), `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `e` is 0, `s` is 0.**
