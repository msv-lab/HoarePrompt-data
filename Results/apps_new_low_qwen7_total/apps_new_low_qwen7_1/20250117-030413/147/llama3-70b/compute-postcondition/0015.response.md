Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for b in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop variable is `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is 1.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n < 100\).
   - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
   - `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - `e` is the count of 1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - `s` is the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**: In each iteration of the loop, `b` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
   - All other variables (`i`, `n`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `e`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`b` is 2, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n < 100\), `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `e` is the count of 1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `s` is the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
