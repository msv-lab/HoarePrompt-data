Output State: **b is 3, i is 3, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the new value of abs(e - s), e is either 1 or 0 plus the value of tabs[2], s is either -1 or 0 plus the negative of the value of tabs[2]**

Explanation:
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` (which is `tabs[2]` since `i` is 3) is 1. If it is, it adds 1 to `e`. Therefore, `e` becomes `e + 1` if `tabs[2]` is 1, or remains `e` otherwise.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` (which is `tabs[2]`) is -1. If it is, it adds 1 to `s`. Therefore, `s` becomes `s + 1` if `tabs[2]` is -1, or remains `s` otherwise.
- All other variables (`b`, `i`, `tabs`, `max_diff`) remain unchanged.
