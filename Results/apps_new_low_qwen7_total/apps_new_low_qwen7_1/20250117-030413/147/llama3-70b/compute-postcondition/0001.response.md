Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `b`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
   - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either `1` or `-1`.
   - `max_diff` is initially `0`.

3. **First Iteration of the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be within the range defined by the loop condition, i.e., `1` to `n + 1`.
   - The smallest value `b` can take is `1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `b` must be set to `1` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Since the loop condition does not depend on `k`, `tabs`, or `max_diff` directly (other than the length of `tabs`), we don't need to adjust these values specifically for the first iteration.

5. **Final State for the First Iteration:**
   - `b` must be `1`.
   - No specific changes are needed for `n`, `k`, `tabs`, or `max_diff` as they do not affect the loop condition for the first iteration.

Therefore, the state required for the first iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`b` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0**
