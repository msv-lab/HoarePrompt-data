Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `b` is 3
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
   - `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
   - `e` is the sum of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`
   - `s` is the negative of the sum of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
   ```

   - This line updates `max_diff` to be the maximum value between its current value and `abs(e - s)`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The only variable directly modified by this line is `max_diff`. It gets updated to the maximum of its current value and `abs(e - s)`.

4. **Updating the Output State**:
   - `b` remains 3.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `tabs` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
   - `e` remains the sum of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - `s` remains the negative of the sum of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - `max_diff` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `abs(e - s)`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `b` is 3
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
- `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
- `e` is the sum of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`
- `s` is the negative of the sum of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`

Output State: **`b` is 3, `i` is `n + 1`, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is the sum of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`, `s` is the negative of the sum of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.**
