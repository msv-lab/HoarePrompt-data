Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `b` is 3
   - `i` is `n`
   - `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
   - `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
   - `e` is 0
   - `s` is 0

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, it checks if `(i - b) % k != 0`. If true, it updates `e` and `s` based on the value of `tabs[i-1]`.

3. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - `b` remains constant at 3.
   - `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`, meaning it will execute `n` times.
   - `tabs` remains unchanged.
   - `max_diff` is updated based on the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between `e` and `s` after each iteration.
   - `e` is updated by adding 1 to `e` if `tabs[i-1]` is 1.
   - `s` is updated by subtracting 1 from `s` if `tabs[i-1]` is -1.

4. **Summarizing the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute `n` times since `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.
   - For each iteration, if `(i - b) % k != 0`, `e` will increment by 1 if `tabs[i-1]` is 1, and `s` will decrement by 1 if `tabs[i-1]` is -1.
   - `max_diff` will be updated as the maximum of 0 and the current absolute difference between `e` and `s`.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `b` remains 3.
   - `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.
   - `tabs` remains unchanged.
   - `max_diff` will be the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between `e` and `s` after the last iteration.
   - `e` will be the sum of the occurrences of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - `s` will be the negative of the sum of the occurrences of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.

### Final Output State

Since the loop runs `n` times, `i` will be `n + 1`. The final values of `e` and `s` depend on the specific values in the `tabs` list and the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.

Output State: **`b` is 3, `i` is `n + 1`, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`, `e` is the sum of 1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`, `s` is the negative of the sum of -1 in `tabs` for indices `i` such that `(i - b) % k != 0`.**
