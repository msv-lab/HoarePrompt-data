Given the initial state:
- `b` is 2
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
- `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`
- `e` is 2 if `tabs[2]` is 1, `e` is 1 if `tabs[2]` is -1
- `s` is 2 if `tabs[2]` is 1, `s` is 1 if `tabs[2]` is -1
- `(i - b) % k` is not equal to 0

And the code block:
```python
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

Let's analyze the code:
1. `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`: This line checks if the value at index `i - 1` (which is 3, since `i` is 4) in the `tabs` list is 1. If it is, `e` will be incremented by 1. Since we don't know the exact value of `tabs[3]`, let's denote it as `x`.
2. `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`: This line checks if the value at index `i - 1` (which is 3, since `i` is 4) in the `tabs` list is -1. If it is, `s` will be incremented by 1. Again, let's denote this value as `y`.

The updated values of `e` and `s` will depend on the values of `tabs[3]`:
- If `tabs[3]` is 1, then `e` will become `e + 1` and `s` will remain unchanged.
- If `tabs[3]` is -1, then `s` will become `s + 1` and `e` will remain unchanged.

Since we do not have the exact value of `tabs[3]` provided, we cannot specify the exact new values of `e` and `s`. However, we can represent them in terms of their current values before the operation:

- If `tabs[3]` is 1, then `e` becomes `e + 1` and `s` remains `s`.
- If `tabs[3]` is -1, then `s` becomes `s + 1` and `e` remains `e`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `e` and `s` based on the value of `tabs[3]`, while keeping all other variables as they were initially or as updated due to the conditions provided. 

Final Output State: **b is 2, i is 4, n is greater than or equal to 1, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, e is e + 1 if tabs[3] is 1 else e, s is s + 1 if tabs[3] is -1 else s, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in tabs from index 1 to n-1**
