Let's analyze the given code and track the changes in the variables through the iterations of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `b` is 1
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100
   - `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
   - `max_diff` is 0
   - `e` is 0
   - `s` is 0

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if (i - b) % k != 0:
           e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
           s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
   ```

3. **Tracking Variable Changes:**
   - `b` remains constant as it is initialized to 1 and does not change within the loop.
   - `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` must hold true for the loop to increment `i`.
   - `e` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1] == 1`.
   - `s` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[i - 1] == -1`.

4. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
   - Since `i` will reach `n` and the loop will continue as long as `(i - b) % k != 0`, the loop will run `n - 1` times (assuming `i` is incremented each time and `k` is such that the condition holds until `i = n`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n`.
   - `e` will be the count of 1s in the `tabs` list from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - `s` will be the count of -1s in the `tabs` list from index 1 to `n-1`.

### Final Output State

- `b` remains 1 since it is never changed within the loop.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `tabs` remains unchanged.
- `max_diff` remains 0 since it is not modified in the loop.
- `e` is the count of 1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.
- `s` is the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.

### Summary of Final Output State

Output State: **`b` is 1, `i` is n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n < 100, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is the count of 1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`, `s` is the count of -1s in `tabs` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
