Output State: **b is 1, i is 2, n is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n < 100, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is 0, e is 0, s is 0, and (i - b) % k is not equal to 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to 1. If it is, it increments the value of `e` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0. The value of `tabs[0]` is not specified, but since it can only be 1 or -1, we don't know the exact value of `e` without knowing `tabs[0]`.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to -1. If it is, it increments the value of `s` by 1. Again, since `tabs[0]` can only be 1 or -1, we don't know the exact value of `s` without knowing `tabs[0]`.

Since no new variables are introduced and no variables other than `i` are changed, the only change is in `i`, which is incremented to 2. The rest of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
