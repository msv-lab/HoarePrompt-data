The code initializes two variables `e` and `s` to 0. The values of `b`, `n`, `tabs`, and `max_diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables and the newly initialized variables.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `tabs` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**
