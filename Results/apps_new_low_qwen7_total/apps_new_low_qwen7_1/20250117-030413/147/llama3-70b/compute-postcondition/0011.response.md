Output State: **b is 1, i is 4, n is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n < 100, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is 0, e is 1 if tabs[3] == 1 else 0, s is 1 if tabs[3] == -1 else 0, and the condition (i - b) % k != 0 holds true**

Explanation:
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` (which is `tabs[3]`) is equal to 1. If it is, `e` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `e` will be 1 if `tabs[3]` is 1, and 0 otherwise.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` (which is `tabs[3]`) is equal to -1. If it is, `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `s` will be 1 if `tabs[3]` is -1, and 0 otherwise.
- All other variables (`b`, `i`, `n`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
