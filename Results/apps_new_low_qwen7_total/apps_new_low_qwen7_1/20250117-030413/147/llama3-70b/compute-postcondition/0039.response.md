Given the initial state:
- `b` is 3
- `i` is 4
- `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1
- `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `abs(e - s)`
- `e` is either 1 or 0 plus the value of `tabs[2]`
- `s` is either -1 or 0 plus the negative of the value of `tabs[2]`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Line 1: `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`**
   - `i` is 4, so `i - 1` is 3.
   - The value of `tabs[3]` will be either 1 or -1 (since it is defined to be either).
   - If `tabs[3]` is 1, then `tabs[i - 1] == 1` evaluates to `True`, which is `1` in Python.
   - If `tabs[3]` is -1, then `tabs[i - 1] == 1` evaluates to `False`, which is `0` in Python.
   - Therefore, `e` will increase by 1 if `tabs[3]` is 1, and remain unchanged otherwise.

2. **Line 2: `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`**
   - Similarly, `i - 1` is 3.
   - The value of `tabs[3]` will be either 1 or -1.
   - If `tabs[3]` is -1, then `tabs[i - 1] == -1` evaluates to `True`, which is `1`.
   - If `tabs[3]` is 1, then `tabs[i - 1] == -1` evaluates to `False`, which is `0`.
   - Therefore, `s` will increase by 1 if `tabs[3]` is -1, and remain unchanged otherwise.

Since we don't know the exact value of `tabs[3]`, let's consider both cases:

- **Case 1: `tabs[3]` is 1**
  - `e` increases by 1.
  - `s` remains unchanged.
  
- **Case 2: `tabs[3]` is -1**
  - `e` remains unchanged.
  - `s` increases by 1.

Given the initial values:
- `e` is either 1 or 0 plus the value of `tabs[2]`.
- `s` is either -1 or 0 plus the negative of the value of `tabs[2]`.

Let's denote the value of `tabs[2]` as `x`. Then:
- `e` is `1 + x` (if `x` is 1) or `x` (if `x` is -1).
- `s` is `-1 - x` (if `x` is 1) or `-x` (if `x` is -1).

Now, applying the changes from the code snippet:
- If `tabs[3]` is 1, `e` becomes `1 + x + 1 = 2 + x`.
- If `tabs[3]` is -1, `s` becomes `-1 - x + 1 = -x`.

Therefore, the final values depend on the value of `tabs[2]` (denoted as `x`):

- `b` remains 3.
- `i` remains 4.
- `tabs` remains unchanged.
- `max_diff` is updated based on the new values of `e` and `s`.
- `e` is `2 + x` if `tabs[3]` is 1, otherwise `x`.
- `s` is `-x` if `tabs[3]` is -1, otherwise `-1 - x`.

The final output state is:
Output State: **b is 3, i is 4, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is the maximum of 0 and the new value of abs(e - s), e is 2 + x if tabs[3] is 1, otherwise x, s is -x if tabs[3] is -1, otherwise -1 - x**
