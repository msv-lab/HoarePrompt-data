Output State: **b is 1, i is 3, n is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n < 100, tabs is a list of n integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, max_diff is 0, e is 1 if tabs[2] == 1 else 0, s is 1 if tabs[2] == -1 else 0, and the condition (i - b) % k != 0 holds true**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `b` as 1, `i` as 3, `n` as an integer in the range 2 to 99, `tabs` as a list of `n` integers each being either 1 or -1, `max_diff` as 0, `e` as 0, `s` as 0, and the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` holds true.
- The code block modifies two variables: `e` and `s`.
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in `tabs` is 1. If it is, `e` is incremented by 1. Given `i` is 3, this checks `tabs[2]`.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in `tabs` is -1. If it is, `s` is incremented by 1. Again, given `i` is 3, this checks `tabs[2]`.

Therefore, depending on the value of `tabs[2]`:
- If `tabs[2]` is 1, then `e` becomes 1.
- If `tabs[2]` is -1, then `s` becomes 1.
- If `tabs[2]` is neither 1 nor -1, `e` and `s` remain 0.

Since the initial value of both `e` and `s` is 0, their new values will be 1 if `tabs[2]` is 1 or -1, respectively. Otherwise, they will remain 0. Hence, the final state includes updated values for `e` and `s` based on the value of `tabs[2]`.
