Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining tabs containing test information (`e`) and the number of remaining tabs containing social network information (`s`).
2. It iterates over all possible choices of `b` (from 1 to `n`), which represents the starting tab to be considered for closing every `k`-th tab.
3. For each choice of `b`, it counts the number of tabs to be kept (`e` for test tabs and `s` for social network tabs) based on the given rule.
4. The program calculates the absolute difference `|e - s|` for each choice of `b` and keeps track of the maximum difference encountered.
5. The final result is printed, which is the maximum absolute difference.

Given that the logic implemented matches the problem statement and requirements, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
