### Reasoning

Let's carefully review the given program and the provided annotated code to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap
Roman needs to close every \( k \)-th tab starting from a chosen tab \( b \). He then calculates the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining tabs containing test information (1) and the number of remaining tabs containing social network information (-1).

#### Provided Code
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)
```

#### Annotated Code
The annotated code describes the following steps:
1. The loop iterates over \( b \) from 1 to \( n \).
2. For each \( b \), another loop runs from 1 to \( n \), updating \( e \) and \( s \) based on the condition \( (i - b) \% k \neq 0 \).
3. \( max_diff \) is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference \( abs(e - s) \).

#### Analysis
1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - `e` and `s` are initialized to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration (for each \( b \)).
   - The inner loop updates `e` and `s` for indices \( i \) where \( (i - b) \% k \neq 0 \).

2. **Tab Closure Condition**:
   - The condition \( (i - b) \% k \neq 0 \) ensures that only the tabs not being closed are counted.
   - This condition correctly identifies the tabs that remain open after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \).

3. **Counting Remaining Tabs**:
   - The program correctly counts the remaining tabs of each type and updates `max_diff` accordingly.
   - This approach ensures that the program considers the correct subset of tabs for each \( b \).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     ```
     Input:
     14 3
     1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1
     ```
   - For \( b = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - Closed tabs: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13
     - Remaining tabs: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14
     - Counts: \( e = 5 \), \( s = 4 \)
     - \( |e - s| = |5 - 4| = 1 \)

   - This matches the expected behavior and output.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program iterates over all possible choices of \( b \) from 1 to \( n \), ensuring that all possible configurations of remaining tabs are considered.
   - The logic for counting the remaining tabs and updating `max_diff` is sound and consistent with the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the loop behavior. The program indeed correctly handles the closure of tabs and calculates the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
