You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `n`.
    #   - Inside the loop, `e` and `s` are initialized to 0.
    #   - For each `b`, another loop runs from 1 to `n`, updating `e` and `s` based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #   - The variable `max_diff` keeps track of the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s (`e`) and -1s (`s`) that satisfy the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `k`, and `tabs` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #   - **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
    #     - `max_diff`: Updated in each iteration of the outer loop.
    #     - `e` and `s`: Updated in each iteration of the inner loop based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop iterates `n` times for each value of `b` from 1 to `n`.
    #   - For each `b`, the inner loop updates `e` and `s` for the indices where `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #   - `max_diff` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference `abs(e - s)`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - After all iterations, `max_diff` will contain the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s in `tabs` for any `b` from 1 to `n` where the indices satisfy `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #
    #### Output State Calculation
    #
    #Given the provided output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can generalize the behavior of the loop. After `n` iterations, the loop will have considered all possible values of `b` from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #- **Final Values**:
    #  - `b`: The last value of `b` considered, which is `n`.
    #  - `i`: The last value of `i` considered, which is `n` in the context of the inner loop.
    #  - `n`: Remains the same as the initial value.
    #  - `tabs`: Remains the same as the initial value.
    #  - `max_diff`: Contains the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s in `tabs` for any `b` from 1 to `n` where the indices satisfy `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #Output State: `b` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` < 100, `tabs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `max_diff` is the maximum of 0 and the absolute difference between the count of 1s and the count of -1s in `tabs` for any `b` from 1 to `n` where the indices satisfy `(i - b) % k != 0`.
    print(max_diff)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining tabs containing test information (`e`) and the number of remaining tabs containing social network information (`s`).
2. It iterates over all possible choices of `b` (from 1 to `n`), which represents the starting tab to be considered for closing every `k`-th tab.
3. For each choice of `b`, it counts the number of tabs to be kept (`e` for test tabs and `s` for social network tabs) based on the given rule.
4. The program calculates the absolute difference `|e - s|` for each choice of `b` and keeps track of the maximum difference encountered.
5. The final result is printed, which is the maximum absolute difference.

Given that the logic implemented matches the problem statement and requirements, the program appears to be correct.
