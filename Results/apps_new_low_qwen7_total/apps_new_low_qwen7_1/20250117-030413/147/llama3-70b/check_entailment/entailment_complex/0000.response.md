Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the inputs `n` and `k` followed by the list `tabs` containing integers 1 and -1. This part of the code is correct and adheres to the problem statement.

2. **Loop Structure**: 
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices `b` from 1 to `n`.
   - The inner loop iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n`, but only updates `e` and `s` for indices where `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - The logic to update `e` and `s` based on the value of `tabs[i-1]` is correct.

3. **Updating `max_diff`**: 
   - `max_diff` is correctly updated to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference `abs(e - s)` after each iteration of the outer loop. This ensures that the final value of `max_diff` is the maximum absolute difference for any valid `b`.

4. **Output**: The function correctly prints the final value of `max_diff`, which is the required output as per the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the specified constraints (2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100) implicitly since the problem statement requires the inputs to be within these bounds. However, the function does not explicitly check for invalid inputs like non-integer values or values outside the specified range. Given the problem constraints, this is acceptable.

6. **General Logic**: The overall logic of the function matches the problem requirements and correctly implements the solution.

Given the analysis, the function appears to be correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
