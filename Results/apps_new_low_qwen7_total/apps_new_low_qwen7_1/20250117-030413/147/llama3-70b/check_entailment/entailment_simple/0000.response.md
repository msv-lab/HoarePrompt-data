Reasoning:

1. **Code Structure and Functionality**:
   - The code correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` and the list of integers representing the types of tabs.
   - It initializes `max_diff` to 0, which will keep track of the maximum absolute difference between the counts of test information tabs (`1`s) and social network tabs (`-1`s).
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible values of `b` (from 1 to `n`), and for each `b`, the inner loop updates `e` and `s` based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.

2. **Loop and Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` ensures that the tab at index `i` is not closed if `i` is `b` plus a multiple of `k`. This means the code correctly simulates Roman's decision to close every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
   - The variables `e` and `s` are updated to count the remaining test information tabs and social network tabs, respectively, for the current `b`.

3. **Max Diff Calculation**:
   - After the inner loop finishes for each `b`, `max_diff` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference `abs(e - s)`.
   - This ensures that `max_diff` captures the maximum difference in counts for any valid `b`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `max_diff` is printed, which is the desired result: the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test information tabs and social network tabs.

Given that the code accurately follows the logic described in the problem statement and correctly calculates the required value, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
