You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function accepts a list of integers `tabs` where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`. It calculates and returns the maximum absolute difference between the number of 1s and -1s in `tabs` for any subsequence starting at index `b` and ending at index `i`, where `(i - b) % k != 0`.

This means the function iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `n`, and for each `b`, it considers subsequences defined by the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`. It keeps track of the maximum absolute difference between the counts of 1s and -1s across all such subsequences. The function ultimately prints this maximum difference.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` or `k` do not satisfy the conditions `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, the behavior is undefined as these constraints are not checked within the function.
- If the list `tabs` contains elements other than 1 and -1, the function still operates, but the results might not be meaningful.

There is no missing functionality mentioned in the code; however, the function assumes that `n` and `k` are valid according to the specified constraints, and it correctly computes the required difference for all valid subsequences defined by the given condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the difference \( |e - s| \). Specifically, the loop that counts the remaining tabs of each type (`e` and `s`) should consider only the tabs that are not closed, but the current implementation counts all tabs regardless of whether they are closed or not.

To illustrate this issue, let's consider the following input:

```
Input:
14 3
1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1
```

The program will iterate over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to 14 and calculate the difference \( |e - s| \) for each choice of \( b \). However, the logic inside the nested loop is flawed because it increments both \( e \) and \( s \) for all tabs, not just the ones that remain after closing every \( k \)-th tab.

For example, when \( b = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program will incorrectly count all tabs instead of only the ones that are not closed. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the remaining tabs and the maximum absolute difference.

A correct solution would involve properly identifying which tabs are closed and updating the counts of remaining tabs accordingly. Here’s a brief outline of how the correct logic could look:

1. Identify the tabs that will be closed based on the chosen \( b \).
2. Count the remaining tabs of each type after these closures.
3. Calculate the difference \( |e - s| \) and keep track of the maximum difference.

Since the current implementation does not correctly handle the closure of tabs, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
