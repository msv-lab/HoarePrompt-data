### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- Roman needs to close every \( k \)-th tab starting from a chosen tab \( b \).
- The goal is to find the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining tabs containing test information (\( e \)) and the number of remaining tabs containing social network information (\( s \)).

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function correctly iterates over all possible choices of \( b \) (from 1 to \( n \)).
- For each \( b \), it counts the number of test tabs (\( e \)) and social network tabs (\( s \)) that remain after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \).
- It calculates the absolute difference \( |e - s| \) for each \( b \) and keeps track of the maximum difference encountered.
- Finally, it prints the maximum absolute difference.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic for Counting Remaining Tabs**:
   - The inner loop should iterate over the indices of the `tabs` list, not over the range from 1 to \( n \). This is because the input list is indexed from 0.
   - The current logic incorrectly counts all tabs that do not meet the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`. Instead, it should count only the tabs that do meet the condition.

2. **Counting Correctly**:
   - The program should iterate over the valid indices `i` and check if `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - If the condition is met, it should update `e` or `s` accordingly.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(n):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(n):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                if tabs[i] == 1:
                    e += 1
                elif tabs[i] == -1:
                    s += 1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)
```

#### Analysis:
- The corrected program now correctly iterates over the indices of the `tabs` list.
- It checks the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` for each tab.
- It updates the counts of `e` and `s` based on the condition.

Given that the corrected program aligns with the problem description and the function summary, and assuming the original assessment did not account for the potential issue in the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct after accounting for the logical issue in the original implementation.
