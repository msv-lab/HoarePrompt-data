### Reasoning:

1. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program iterates over all possible starting positions `b` (from 1 to `n`), considering each position as a potential starting point for closing every `k`-th tab.
   - For each `b`, it counts the number of tabs containing test information (`e`) and social network information (`s`) that remain open, i.e., where `(i - b) % k != 0`.

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - The inner loop correctly updates `e` and `s` based on the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
   - The `e` and `s` variables are incremented based on whether the current tab is a test tab (1) or a social network tab (-1).

3. **Tracking Maximum Difference**:
   - The variable `max_diff` is updated to keep track of the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s` encountered during the iterations.
   - This ensures that the final value of `max_diff` is the largest possible difference between the counts of test and social network tabs for any starting position `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly check for the validity of `n` and `k` (i.e., `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`), but it does assume that these constraints are satisfied.
   - The program also assumes that the `tabs` list only contains 1s and -1s, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `max_diff`, which is the desired output.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all relevant cases without errors.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining tabs containing test information and social network information for any valid starting position `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
