Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of tabs `n` and the interval `k`, followed by the types of the tabs. It initializes the `max_diff` variable to store the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`).

2. **Main Logic**: The program iterates over all possible starting points `b` for closing tabs, calling the `func_1` function to determine the remaining tabs after closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`. It then counts the number of `1`s (test information tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in the resulting list and calculates the absolute difference `abs(e - s)`. It keeps track of the maximum difference seen so far.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a starting point `b` and modifies the `remaining_tabs` list by setting elements at indices `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]` to `0`.
   - The first loop in the function is incorrectly decrementing `i` by `k`, which should instead be incrementing `i` by `k`.
   - The second loop in the function is correctly decrementing `i` by `k`, but it is unnecessary because the correct operation should increment `i` by `k` starting from `b`.

4. **Corrected Function**:
   - The corrected version of `func_1` should iterate over indices starting from `b` and increment by `k` each time, setting these indices to `0`.
   - The corrected function would look like this:
     ```python
     def func_1(b):
         remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
         for i in range(b, n, k):
             remaining_tabs[i] = 0
         return remaining_tabs
     ```

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `b` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute, and `remaining_tabs` will be a copy of `tab_types`.
   - If `k` is `1`, the loop will iterate over all indices from `b` to `n-1`, setting all values to `0` starting from `b`.
   - If `b` is `1` and `k` is close to `n`, the loop will only set a few values to `0`, specifically those in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`.

Given the analysis, the current implementation of the program and the function `func_1` has a logic error in the first loop, but the overall logic is sound. Once corrected, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
