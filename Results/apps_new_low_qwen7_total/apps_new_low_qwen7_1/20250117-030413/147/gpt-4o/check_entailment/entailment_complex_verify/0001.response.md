### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified a critical flaw in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function incorrectly sets the values to `0` instead of marking them for removal. This misinterpretation led to an incorrect implementation where tabs are essentially removed instead of marked for removal.

The corrected function should mark the tabs to be removed using a special marker (e.g., `-2`), and then the main loop should count the remaining `1`s and `-1`s to determine the maximum absolute difference. This is accurately described in the annotations, which state that `remaining_tabs[i]` should be set to `0` only in the intended removal process.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotations, the step-by-step analysis reveals that the original function already correctly simulates the removal process by setting the tabs to `0` when they are to be closed. This means that the original code is actually correct, as it follows the intended logic of marking and counting the remaining tabs.

The annotations mention potential edge cases and the behavior of the function, but they do not contradict the original code's logic. The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the list, marks the tabs to be removed, and returns the modified list. The main loop then correctly calculates the difference between the remaining `1`s and `-1`s.

Therefore, the original assessment was overly critical and misunderstood the intent of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
