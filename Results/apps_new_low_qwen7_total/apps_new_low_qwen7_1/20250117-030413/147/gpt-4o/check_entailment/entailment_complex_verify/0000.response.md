### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The program's logic and the function `func_1(b)` are designed to work as intended, despite the annotations suggesting a potential mistake. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1(b)`**:
   - The function takes an integer `b` and creates a copy of `tab_types`.
   - It then iterates over the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time, setting these indices to `0`.
   - It also iterates over the list in reverse starting from `b-1` and decrements by `-k` each time, setting these indices to `0`.

2. **Behavior of the Loops**:
   - The first loop: `for i in range(b, n, k)` sets indices `[b, b+k, b+2k, ..., min(n-1, b+(floor((n-b)/k)*k))]` to `0`.
   - The second loop: `for i in range(b-1, -1, -k)` sets indices `[b-1, b-k-1, b-2k-1, ..., 0]` to `0`.

3. **Effect on `remaining_tabs`**:
   - These loops ensure that all indices starting from `b` and incrementing/decrementing by `k` are set to `0`.
   - After these loops, `remaining_tabs` contains all `0`s at indices `[b, b+k, b+2k, ..., b+(floor((n-b)/k)*k)]` and retains the original values elsewhere.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `remaining_tabs` directly without any additional filtering.
   - Since `remaining_tabs` is already set to `0` at the specified indices, it effectively removes those tabs.

5. **Calculation of Maximum Absolute Difference**:
   - The main program then counts the remaining `1`s (test information) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in `remaining_tabs`.
   - It calculates the maximum absolute difference between the counts of `1`s and `-1`s.

Given the above, the function `func_1(b)` correctly simulates the process of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b` and returns the appropriate modified list. The logic matches the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Therefore, the original assessment incorrectly identified a mistake in the function `func_1(b)`. The provided function works as intended, and the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
