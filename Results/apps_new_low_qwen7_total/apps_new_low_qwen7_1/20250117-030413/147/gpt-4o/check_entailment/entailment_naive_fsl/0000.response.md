Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to simulate the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from tab \(b\). Specifically, the function `func_1(b)` is not correctly implemented. It sets elements to 0 instead of removing them entirely, which means it retains the original list rather than creating a new list with the specified tabs removed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
n = 6
k = 2
tab_types = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]
```
If Roman chooses \(b = 1\), the expected result would be to remove tabs 1, 3, and 5, leaving [0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1]. However, the current implementation will still keep the original tab types and simply set them to 0, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this, the function `func_1(b)` should create a new list and remove the tabs as described, rather than modifying the original list in place. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b-1, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    return [t for t in remaining_tabs if t != 0]
```

This corrected function properly removes the tabs according to the rules and calculates the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs correctly.
