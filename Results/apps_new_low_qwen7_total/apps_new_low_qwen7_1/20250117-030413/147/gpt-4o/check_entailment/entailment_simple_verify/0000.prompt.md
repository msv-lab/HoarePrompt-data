You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The list consists of n integers, each equal to either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables:
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time.
    #   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
    #   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
    #   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i + k` on each iteration.
    #
    #3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
    #   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.
    #
    #4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and incrementing by `k` until `i >= n`.
    #   - The loop stops executing once `i` exceeds `n - 1`.
    #
    #5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
    #   - The loop will execute `floor((n - b) / k)` times if `(n - b) % k == 0` or `floor((n - b) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
    #   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b + k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))]` will be set to `0`.
    #
    #### Final Output State Calculation
    #
    #After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b + k, b + 2k, ..., min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #Output State: `total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list of `n` integers where `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`, and `i` is undefined outside the loop context.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, and `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all other `i`.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs` is a list where for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, `remaining_tabs[i] = 0`, and for all other `i`, `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to simulate the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from tab \(b\). Specifically, the function `func_1(b)` is not correctly implemented. It sets elements to 0 instead of removing them entirely, which means it retains the original list rather than creating a new list with the specified tabs removed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
n = 6
k = 2
tab_types = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]
```
If Roman chooses \(b = 1\), the expected result would be to remove tabs 1, 3, and 5, leaving [0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1]. However, the current implementation will still keep the original tab types and simply set them to 0, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this, the function `func_1(b)` should create a new list and remove the tabs as described, rather than modifying the original list in place. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b-1, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    return [t for t in remaining_tabs if t != 0]
```

This corrected function properly removes the tabs according to the rules and calculates the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs correctly.
