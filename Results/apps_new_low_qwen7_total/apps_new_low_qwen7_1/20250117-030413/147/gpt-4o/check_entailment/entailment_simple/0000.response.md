### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Code Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of tabs (`n`) and the interval (`k`) to close tabs.
   - It also reads the type of each tab (either `1` for test information or `-1` for social networks).
   - A function `func_1(b)` is defined to simulate the process of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.

2. **Function `func_1(b)`**:
   - This function takes an integer `b` as input.
   - It creates a copy of the `tab_types` list named `remaining_tabs`.
   - It iterates through the indices starting from `b` and increments by `k` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
   - During each iteration, it sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0`, effectively marking the tab as closed.
   - After the loop, it reverses the process to close tabs from `b` backward, ensuring all indices from `b` to the start are considered.
   - Finally, it returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program iterates over all possible values of `b` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each `b`, it calls `func_1(b)` to get the modified list `remaining_tabs`.
   - It counts the number of `1`s (test information tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in `remaining_tabs`.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between these counts and updates `max_diff` if the current difference is larger.

4. **Analysis of Function `func_1(b)`**:
   - The loop correctly updates `remaining_tabs` to mark every `k`-th tab starting from `b` as closed.
   - The backward loop ensures all tabs from `b` to the start are considered.
   - The function correctly simulates the tab-closing process.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop correctly considers all possible choices for `b` and calculates the maximum absolute difference in tab types.

6. **Output**:
   - The final output is the maximum absolute difference calculated, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement accurately. The function `func_1(b)` correctly simulates the tab-closing process, and the main loop correctly finds the maximum absolute difference in tab types.

**Correctness: True**
