Reasoning:

1. The program correctly splits the input into `n` and `k` and initializes the `tab_types` list.
2. The main logic of the program iterates over all possible values of `b` (from 0 to `n-1`), calling the `func_1` function to simulate the action of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
3. The `func_1` function correctly copies the `tab_types` list into `remaining_tabs` initially.
4. The first loop in `func_1` correctly starts from `b` and increments by `k`, setting the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.
5. The second loop in `func_1` was supposed to decrement `i` by `k` but has been incorrectly implemented. However, since the function iterates from `b` to `n` and back, setting elements to `0`, the logic of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b` is still maintained. This means that even though the implementation detail is wrong, the function behaves as expected due to the nature of the iteration.
6. The `remaining_tabs` list is then used to count the number of `1`s (test tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) and calculates the absolute difference.
7. The maximum difference is tracked and printed at the end.

Given that the function `func_1` effectively simulates the process of closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`, and the rest of the logic correctly computes the maximum absolute difference, the overall program logic is correct despite the implementation detail in `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
