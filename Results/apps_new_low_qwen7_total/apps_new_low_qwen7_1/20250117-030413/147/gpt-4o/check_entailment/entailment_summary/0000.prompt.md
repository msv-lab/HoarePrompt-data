Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

# Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0
for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = func_1(b)
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
print(max_diff)

def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    return remaining_tabs





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b` and returns a list `remaining_tabs`. After execution, `remaining_tabs` is a modified version of the original `tab_types` list. Specifically, for all indices `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` is set to `0`. For all other indices `i`, `remaining_tabs[i]` retains the value from `tab_types[i]`.

This behavior can be explained as follows:
1. The function starts by copying `tab_types` into `remaining_tabs`.
2. It then iterates over indices of `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time, setting these indices to `0`.
3. The first for-loop in the code snippet contains a mistake. Instead of decrementing `i` by `k` (`for i in range(b, -1, -k)`), it should increment `i` by `k` (`for i in range(b, n, k)`). This mistake would result in incorrect behavior where indices are set to `0` in reverse order, which is not intended based on the annotations and return postconditions.
4. After the correction, the function iterates over indices starting from `b` and increments by `-k` each time, setting these indices to `0`. However, this is unnecessary because the correct iteration should start from `b` and increment by `k`, as mentioned in the annotations.
5. Finally, the function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute, and `remaining_tabs` will be a copy of `tab_types`.
- If `k` is `1`, the loop will iterate over all indices from `b` to `n-1`, setting all values to `0` starting from `b`.
- If `b` is `1` and `k` is close to `n`, the loop will only set a few values to `0`, specifically those in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`.

In summary, the function sets certain indices of the `remaining_tabs` list to `0` based on the value of `b` and `k`, and returns the modified list. The corrected code ensures that the loop operates as intended, and the returned list reflects the specified postconditions.
