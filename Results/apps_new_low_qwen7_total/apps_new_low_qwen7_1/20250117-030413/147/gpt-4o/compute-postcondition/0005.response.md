Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `b` to `n` with a step size of `k`.
   - The loop condition for the for loop is `i < n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\).
   - `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1.
   - `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types` except `remaining_tabs[b]` is 0, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0 where `i` is `b + k`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last value it took before the loop exited due to the condition `i < n` failing.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + k`.

4. **Check if the next value of `i` satisfies the loop condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i + k` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + k`.
   - The other variables (`total`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `remaining_tabs`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given the above reasoning, let's write the final state:

- `total` remains unspecified.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `tab_types` remains the same.
- `remaining_tabs` remains the same.

The only state that changes is `i` to `i + k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` is the same, `k` is the same, `b` is the same, `tab_types` is the same, `remaining_tabs` is the same, `i` is `i + k`**
