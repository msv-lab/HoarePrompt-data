You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The list consists of n integers, each equal to either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network).
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables:
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time.
    #   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
    #   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
    #   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i + k` on each iteration.
    #
    #3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
    #   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.
    #
    #4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and incrementing by `k` until `i >= n`.
    #   - The loop stops executing once `i` exceeds `n - 1`.
    #
    #5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
    #   - The loop will execute `floor((n - b) / k)` times if `(n - b) % k == 0` or `floor((n - b) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
    #   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b + k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))]` will be set to `0`.
    #
    #### Final Output State Calculation
    #
    #After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b + k, b + 2k, ..., min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #Output State: `total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list of `n` integers where `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`, and `i` is undefined outside the loop context.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, and `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all other `i`.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs` is a list where for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, `remaining_tabs[i] = 0`, and for all other `i`, `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, and returns a list `remaining_tabs` where for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, `remaining_tabs[i] = 0`, and for all other `i`, `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]`.

```

Return Postconditions: `remaining_tabs` is a list where for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, `remaining_tabs[i] = 0`, and for all other `i`, `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
