`remaining_tabs[i]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `i` is `i + k`, but since `i + k` is just an updated value of `i`, we will keep `i` as `i + k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` is the same, `k` is the same, `b` is the same, `tab_types` is the same, `remaining_tabs` is the same, `i` is `i + k`, `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0**
