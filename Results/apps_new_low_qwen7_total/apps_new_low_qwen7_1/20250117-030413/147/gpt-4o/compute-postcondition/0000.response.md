The code `remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]` creates a copy of the list `tab_types` and assigns it to the variable `remaining_tabs`. This does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `b`, nor does it affect the contents of the `tab_types` list itself. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The list `tab_types` consists of `n` integers, each equal to either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network); `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types`.**
