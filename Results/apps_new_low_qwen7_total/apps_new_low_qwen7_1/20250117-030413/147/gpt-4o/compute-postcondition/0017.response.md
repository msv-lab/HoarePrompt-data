Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b` and returns a list `remaining_tabs`. After execution, `remaining_tabs` is a modified version of the original `tab_types` list. Specifically, for all indices `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` is set to `0`. For all other indices `i`, `remaining_tabs[i]` retains the value from `tab_types[i]`.

This behavior can be explained as follows:
1. The function starts by copying `tab_types` into `remaining_tabs`.
2. It then iterates over indices of `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time, setting these indices to `0`.
3. The first for-loop in the code snippet contains a mistake. Instead of decrementing `i` by `k` (`for i in range(b, -1, -k)`), it should increment `i` by `k` (`for i in range(b, n, k)`). This mistake would result in incorrect behavior where indices are set to `0` in reverse order, which is not intended based on the annotations and return postconditions.
4. After the correction, the function iterates over indices starting from `b` and increments by `-k` each time, setting these indices to `0`. However, this is unnecessary because the correct iteration should start from `b` and increment by `k`, as mentioned in the annotations.
5. Finally, the function returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute, and `remaining_tabs` will be a copy of `tab_types`.
- If `k` is `1`, the loop will iterate over all indices from `b` to `n-1`, setting all values to `0` starting from `b`.
- If `b` is `1` and `k` is close to `n`, the loop will only set a few values to `0`, specifically those in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`.

In summary, the function sets certain indices of the `remaining_tabs` list to `0` based on the value of `b` and `k`, and returns the modified list. The corrected code ensures that the loop operates as intended, and the returned list reflects the specified postconditions.**
