The code sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to 0, where `i` is `b - 2k`. Since `remaining_tabs[b - k]` was initially 0 and `i` is `b - 2k`, the value of `remaining_tabs[b - 2k]` is now 0. The value of `i` remains `b - 2k`, and the value of `remaining_tabs[b - k]` remains 0.

Output State: **`remaining_tabs[b - k]` is 0, `remaining_tabs[b - 2k]` is 0, `i` is `b - 2k`**
