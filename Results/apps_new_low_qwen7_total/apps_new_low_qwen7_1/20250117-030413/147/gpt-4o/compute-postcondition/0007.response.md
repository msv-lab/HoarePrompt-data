Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time.
   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i + k` on each iteration.

3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.

4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and incrementing by `k` until `i >= n`.
   - The loop stops executing once `i` exceeds `n - 1`.

5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute `floor((n - b) / k)` times if `(n - b) % k == 0` or `floor((n - b) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b + k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))]` will be set to `0`.

### Final Output State Calculation

After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b + k, b + 2k, ..., min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.

### Conclusion

Output State: `total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list of `n` integers where `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`, and `i` is undefined outside the loop context.
