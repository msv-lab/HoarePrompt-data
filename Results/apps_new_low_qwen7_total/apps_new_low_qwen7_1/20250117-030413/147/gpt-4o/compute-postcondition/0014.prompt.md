Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time.
   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i + k` on each iteration.

3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.

4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and incrementing by `k` until `i >= n`.
   - The loop stops executing once `i` exceeds `n - 1`.

5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute `floor((n - b) / k)` times if `(n - b) % k == 0` or `floor((n - b) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b + k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))]` will be set to `0`.

### Final Output State Calculation

After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b + k, b + 2k, ..., min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.

### Conclusion

Output State: `total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list of `n` integers where `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`, and `i` is undefined outside the loop context.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    remaining_tabs[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is 0, `i` is `b - k`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is 0, `remaining_tabs[b - 2k]` is 0, `i` is `b - 2k`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
