Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their current values:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop starts from `b` and decrements by `k` until `i` is no longer greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0.

3. **Understand how the loop variable changes:**
   - The loop decrements `i` by `k` each time it iterates.

4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still satisfy the condition `i >= 0`.

5. **Calculate the new value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by `k`, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be `b - k`.

6. **Update the state:**
   - The `remaining_tabs` array and the specific index `i` will change as per the loop decrement.
   - However, since the problem only asks for the state of the loop variables and the condition for the next iteration, we focus on updating `i`.

7. **Final state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - `remaining_tabs[i]` remains 0 (since the loop body is omitted and we only care about the loop head).
   - `i` is now `b - k`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`remaining_tabs[i]` is 0, `i` is `b - k`**
