Let's break down the given loop and determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Loop
```python
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop uses the `range()` function to generate a sequence of indices starting from `b` and decrementing by `-k` each time.
   - The loop will continue as long as the generated index `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

2. **Identify Relevant Variables**:
   - The loop is controlled by the variables `i`, `b`, and `k`.
   - `i` is the index being iterated over.
   - `b` is the starting index.
   - `k` is the decrement step size.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the initial value of `i` (which is `b`) must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Additionally, the loop should not immediately terminate due to the decrement step size `-k`.

### Determining the Initial Conditions

- **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `b`.
- **Condition for First Iteration**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Final State for the Loop Head

To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to adjust the initial state of the relevant variables.

**State:**
- `b` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `k` must be a positive integer (since it is used for decrementing, it must be non-zero).

### Conclusion

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:

**State:**
- `total` is unspecified,
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\) (though these are not directly involved in the loop condition),
- `b` is an integer such that \(b \geq -1\),
- `k` is a positive integer.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:

```
State: **total is unspecified, b is an integer such that b >= -1, k is a positive integer**
```
