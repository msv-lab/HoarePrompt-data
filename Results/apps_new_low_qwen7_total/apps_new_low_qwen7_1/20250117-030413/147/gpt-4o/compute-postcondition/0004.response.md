`i` is set to `b + k`. The value of `remaining_tabs[i]` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types` except `remaining_tabs[b]` is 0, and `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0 where `i` is `b + k`.**
