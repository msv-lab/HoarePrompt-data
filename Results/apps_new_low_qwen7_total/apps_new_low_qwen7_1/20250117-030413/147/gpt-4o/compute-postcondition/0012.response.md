Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `b` to `-1` with a step of `-k`. This means that `i` decreases by `k` in each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is 0
   - `i` is `b - k`

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decreases `i` by `k` in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `b - k - k = b - 2k`.

5. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, `b - 2k >= -1`.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `remaining_tabs[b - k]` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` changes to `b - 2k`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b - 2k >= -1`, but since we are adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we focus on the new value of `i`.

State: **`remaining_tabs[b - k]` is 0, `i` is `b - 2k`**
