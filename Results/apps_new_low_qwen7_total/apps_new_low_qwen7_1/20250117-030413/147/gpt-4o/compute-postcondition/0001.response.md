To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the requirements and constraints given:

1. **Variables `n`, `k`, and `b`:**
   - `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`
   - `1 ≤ b ≤ n`

2. **List `tab_types`:**
   - Consists of `n` integers, each equal to either 1 or -1.

3. **List `remaining_tabs`:**
   - A copy of `tab_types`.

4. **Loop:**
   - `for i in range(b, n, k):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values of `i` in the Loop:**
   - The loop will start with `i = b` and increment by `k` until `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be equal to `b`.

2. **Range Constraints:**
   - Since `i` starts from `b` and increments by `k`, the initial value of `i` must be within the range `[b, n)`.

3. **Constraints on `b` and `k`:**
   - Given `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, the smallest possible value for `b` is 1, but since `n ≥ 2`, `b` can be 1.
   - For the loop to start, `b` must be within the valid range, and `k` must be such that `b` is a valid starting point for the range.

4. **Lists `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs`:**
   - These lists are not directly involved in the loop condition, but they are necessary to ensure the loop can proceed as expected.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the initial value of `i` must be `b`. Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head should reflect this requirement.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types`, and `i` is set to `b`.**
