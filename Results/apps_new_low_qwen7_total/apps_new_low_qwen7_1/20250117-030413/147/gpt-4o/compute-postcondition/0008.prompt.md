You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and increments by `k` each time.
   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i + k` on each iteration.

3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.

4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and incrementing by `k` until `i >= n`.
   - The loop stops executing once `i` exceeds `n - 1`.

5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute `floor((n - b) / k)` times if `(n - b) % k == 0` or `floor((n - b) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b + k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))]` will be set to `0`.

### Final Output State Calculation

After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b + k, b + 2k, ..., min(n - 1, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k))` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.

### Conclusion

Output State: `total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a list of `n` integers where `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, b + (floor((n - b) / k) * k)]`, and `i` is undefined outside the loop context.
```
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
