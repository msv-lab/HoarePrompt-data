Let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Given Loop

```python
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    remaining_tabs[i] = 0
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `remaining_tabs` starting from `b` and decrements by `k` each time.
   - The condition `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n` define the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `b`.
   - `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` are initially copies of each other, meaning `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all valid `i`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `b`, `n`, `k`, and `tab_types` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `remaining_tabs` changes as it gets updated to `0` at specific indices.
   - `i` is a temporary variable used within the loop and is updated to `i - k` on each iteration.

3. **Identify Invariant Variables**:
   - `n`, `k`, `b`, `tab_types`, and `i` (though `i` is not visible outside the loop) are invariants.

4. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop updates `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each index `i` starting from `b` and decrementing by `k` until `i < 0`.
   - The loop stops executing once `i` becomes less than `0`.

5. **Determine the Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute `floor((b + 1) / k)` times if `(b + 1) % k == 0` or `floor((b + 1) / k) + 1` times otherwise.
   - For each iteration, `remaining_tabs[b]`, `remaining_tabs[b - k]`, ..., `remaining_tabs[max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]` will be set to `0`.

### Final Output State Calculation

After the loop completes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have all the elements at positions `b, b - k, b - 2k, ..., max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)` set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged and equal to the corresponding elements in `tab_types`.

### Conclusion

Output State: `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`. All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their corresponding elements in `tab_types`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`remaining_tabs[i] = 0` for all `i` in the range `[b, max(0, b - (floor((b + 1) / k) * k) - 1)]`, and `remaining_tabs[i] = tab_types[i]` for all other `i`.**
