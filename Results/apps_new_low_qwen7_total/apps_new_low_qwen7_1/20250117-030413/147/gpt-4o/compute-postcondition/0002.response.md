The code `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` updates the value of `remaining_tabs` at index `i` to `0`. The value of `i` is set to `b`, so `remaining_tabs[b]` is now `0`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `tab_types` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types` except `remaining_tabs[b]` is 0, and `i` is set to `b`.**
