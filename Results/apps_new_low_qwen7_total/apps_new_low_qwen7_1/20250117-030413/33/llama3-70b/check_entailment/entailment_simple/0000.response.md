Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The program correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
   - For each move, it updates `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance provided.
   - It checks if `curr_lat` goes out of bounds (-90 to 90) or if the movement violates the rules (e.g., moving North when already at the North Pole).
   - After processing all moves, it checks if `curr_lat` is back at the North Pole (90) to ensure the journey ends there.

2. **Edge Cases and Validation:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `curr_lat` might exceed the valid range or violate movement rules.
   - The logic for checking if the journey ends at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) is correctly implemented.
   - The program uses `exit()` to immediately terminate and print "NO" if any condition is violated, ensuring no further unnecessary computation.

3. **Correctness:**
   - The program follows the problem requirements accurately.
   - It ensures that Limak can only move South when at the North Pole and only move North when at the South Pole.
   - It correctly checks that the journey ends at the North Pole.
   - The logic is sound and handles all given constraints and examples properly.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
