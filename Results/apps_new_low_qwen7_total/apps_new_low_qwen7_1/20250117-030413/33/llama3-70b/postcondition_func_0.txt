The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and calculates the resulting latitude. It ensures that the calculated latitude remains within the valid geographic range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the latitude exceeds these bounds or if certain invalid conditions occur during the process, the function prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' indicating that the final latitude is within the valid range. The function does not return any value.
