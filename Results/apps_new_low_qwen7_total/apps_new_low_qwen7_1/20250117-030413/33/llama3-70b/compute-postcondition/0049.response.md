The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to operate on a set of predefined variables `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each i from 1 to n, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East". 

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function does not return any value explicitly described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on predefined variables `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` without returning any specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined variables n, t_i, and dir_i, and does not return any value.**
