The code updates `curr_lat` by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. Since `t` is an integer and `curr_lat` is initially 90, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`. The variables `n`, `dir`, and the initial value of `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90 + t / 111.195, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'North'**
