The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90], `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
