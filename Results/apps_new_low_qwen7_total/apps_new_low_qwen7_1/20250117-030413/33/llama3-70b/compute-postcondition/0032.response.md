The given code block consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines do not affect any variables and simply print "NO" and then terminate the program execution. Given that no variables are modified and the initial state is not altered by these lines, the output state remains the same as the initial state provided in the precondition.

Output State: **curr_lat is adjusted based on the value of dir and t. If curr_lat is exactly -90 and dir is not 'North', curr_lat remains -90. Otherwise, curr_lat stays within the valid range [-90, 90]. No other variables are affected.**
