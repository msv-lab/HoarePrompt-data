Output State: **curr_lat is 90 if dir is not 'North' or 'South', curr_lat is 90 + t / 111.195 if dir is 'North', curr_lat is 90 - t / 111.195 if dir is 'South', n is greater than 0, t is an integer, and dir is a string**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('NO')` prints 'NO' to the console but does not affect any variables.
- The second line `exit()` immediately terminates the program without further execution of the code. Therefore, no other lines are executed, and the values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged from their initial states.
