The given code snippet reads an integer `n` from input and initializes `curr_lat` to 90. However, the rest of the code block is incomplete, as there are no further lines provided to update or use `n` or `curr_lat`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and `curr_lat` is 90, and considering that the remaining lines are missing, the only variables that are explicitly modified or referenced are `n` (which gets an integer value from input) and `curr_lat` (which is set to 90).

Since no additional operations are performed on `n` or `curr_lat`, their values remain as follows after the provided lines are executed:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `curr_lat` is 90.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, curr_lat is 90**
