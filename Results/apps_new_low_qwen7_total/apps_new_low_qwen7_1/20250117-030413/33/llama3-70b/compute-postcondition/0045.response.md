The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines indicate that the program should print 'NO' and then terminate immediately without executing any further code. Given this, the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` will not be modified or affected by the code execution. The conditions specified in the precondition will remain unchanged.

Output State: **curr_lat is within the valid range [-90, 90], n is greater than 0, t is an integer, and dir is a string. If curr_lat equals -90 and dir is not 'North', then the condition is met; otherwise, curr_lat remains unchanged.**
