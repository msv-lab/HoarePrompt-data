Output State: **curr_lat is 90, n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**

Explanation:
The given code snippet contains two lines. The first line prints 'NO' and the second line calls the `exit()` function. These lines do not modify any of the variables (`curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`). The code's condition checks if `curr_lat` is outside the range of -90 to 90, which it is (90 is not within this range), but since the conditions inside the if-statement are not met (as `dir` is not 'North' or 'South'), the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as described above.
