The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the program flow in a meaningful way. The precondition remains the same.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the direction `dir` is not 'South'**
