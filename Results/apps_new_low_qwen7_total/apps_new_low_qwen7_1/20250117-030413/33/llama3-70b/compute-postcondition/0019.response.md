Output State: **curr_lat is 90, n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**

Explanation: The provided code consists of two lines, both of which are not executed due to the presence of `print('NO')` followed immediately by `exit()`. As a result, no modifications are made to the initial state, and all variables retain their initial values.
