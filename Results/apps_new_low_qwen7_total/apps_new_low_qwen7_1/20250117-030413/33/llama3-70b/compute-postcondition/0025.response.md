The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
