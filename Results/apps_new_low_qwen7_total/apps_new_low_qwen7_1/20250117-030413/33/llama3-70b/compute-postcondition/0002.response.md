Output State: **curr_lat is 90, n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**

Explanation:
- The first line splits the input into two parts, assigning the integer part to `t` and the string part to `dir`.
- The value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged at 90.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0 but is not directly modified by this code block; it is just referenced in the precondition.
- `t` is assigned the integer value of the first part of the input.
- `dir` is assigned the string value of the second part of the input.
