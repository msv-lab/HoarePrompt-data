Functionality: **The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and calculates the resulting latitude. It ensures that the calculated latitude remains within the valid geographic range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the latitude exceeds these bounds or if certain invalid conditions occur during the process, the function prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' indicating that the final latitude is within the valid range. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. The function does not handle the cases where the latitude reaches exactly -90 or 90 degrees except when the corresponding direction ('North' or 'South') is specified. For instance, if the latitude is -90 and a 'South' movement is attempted, or if the latitude is 90 and a 'North' movement is attempted, the function still prints 'NO'. This could be considered an edge case as the function should ideally handle these boundary conditions more gracefully.
2. The function does not explicitly handle the case where the input `n` is less than 1 or greater than 50. While the code checks the validity of `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6), it does not check if `n` is within the specified range.
3. The function assumes that `dir` will always be one of the valid directions ("North", "South", "West", "East"). If an invalid direction is provided, the function will continue without updating the latitude, which might lead to incorrect results. This is another potential edge case.
