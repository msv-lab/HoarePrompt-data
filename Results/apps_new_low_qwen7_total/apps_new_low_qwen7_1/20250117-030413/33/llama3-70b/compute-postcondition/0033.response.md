Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir` and `t`. If `curr_lat` is exactly 90 and `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90]. If `curr_lat` is exactly -90 and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` remains -90. Otherwise, `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90]. No other variables are affected.***
