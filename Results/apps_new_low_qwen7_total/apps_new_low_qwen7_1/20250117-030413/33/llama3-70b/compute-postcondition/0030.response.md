Output State: **curr_lat is adjusted based on the value of dir and t, dir is a string, t is an integer, n is greater than 0, no other variables are affected**

Explanation:
- The first line prints 'NO'.
- The second line exits the program.
Since the program exits immediately after printing 'NO', no further modifications to variables occur. Therefore, the initial conditions for `curr_lat` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified. The other variables (`dir`, `t`, `n`) are mentioned but not explicitly modified by the code.
