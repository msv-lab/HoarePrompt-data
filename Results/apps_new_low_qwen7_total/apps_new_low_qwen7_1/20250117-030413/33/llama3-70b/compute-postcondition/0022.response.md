The first line takes input in the form of two space-separated values and splits them into `t` and `dir`. Then it converts `t` to an integer. After executing these lines, the values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, but `dir` now holds the second value from the input and `t` holds the integer value of the first input. 

Given the initial state where `curr_lat` is 90, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string, and after running the code block, we can conclude the following:
- `curr_lat` remains 90.
- `n` remains greater than 0 (no specific value is provided or changed).
- `t` becomes the integer value of the first input.
- `dir` becomes the string value of the second input.

Output State: **curr_lat is 90, n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**
