Output State: **curr_lat is 90, n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string and its value is not 'North'**

Explanation:
- The print statement 'print('NO')' is executed but it does not modify any variable; it just prints 'NO'.
- The 'exit()' function call terminates the program immediately after the print statement, preventing further execution of the remaining lines in the code block.
- Since no variables are modified within the code block, their pre-existing states remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all the initial conditions without any alteration.
