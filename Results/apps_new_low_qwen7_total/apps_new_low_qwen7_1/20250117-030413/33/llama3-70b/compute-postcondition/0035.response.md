The initial state is that `curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90] and `n` must be greater than 0. The code snippet provided performs the following actions:

1. It takes a string input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `t` (after converting it to an integer) and the second part to `dir`.

The second line does not modify any existing variables; it merely assigns the integer value of the first part of the input to `t`. The `dir` variable receives the second part of the input as a string.

Since no new variables are defined and the only change is the assignment of `t` (an integer), and the `dir` (a string), we need to consider the constraints and initial values provided. However, the specific value of `curr_lat` and `n` are not altered by the code, and `t` and `dir` are introduced.

Output State: **curr_lat is within the valid range [-90, 90], n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**
