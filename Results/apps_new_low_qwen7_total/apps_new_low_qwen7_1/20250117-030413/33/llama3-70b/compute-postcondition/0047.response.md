Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90], `n` is equal to the number of times the loop was executed, `t` is an integer representing the last distance traveled, `dir` is a string representing the direction of the last movement, provided that no exit conditions were met. If `curr_lat` is 90, `dir` must be 'South'. If `curr_lat` is -90, `dir` must be 'North'.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop processes movements in latitude (`curr_lat`) based on the given direction (`dir`) and distance (`t`). The initial state has `curr_lat` set to 90, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**: `n` is decremented with each iteration but starts at a value greater than 0. `t` and `dir` are read from the input and updated during each iteration.
   - **Variable Changes**: `curr_lat` can change based on the direction (`dir`) and distance (`t`). The loop ensures that `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90] by checking and adjusting its value accordingly.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - After each iteration, `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction and distance provided. If `curr_lat` exceeds the valid range, the loop exits with an error message.
   - The loop ensures that if `curr_lat` becomes exactly 90, `dir` must be 'South', and if `curr_lat` becomes exactly -90, `dir` must be 'North'.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions for exiting the loop ensure that `curr_lat` remains within the valid range [-90, 90].
   - The final state of `curr_lat` and the corresponding `dir` are consistent with the loop's behavior and the exit conditions.

Thus, after the loop completes all iterations, `curr_lat` will be within the valid range [-90, 90], `n` will be the number of iterations executed, `t` will be the distance of the last movement, and `dir` will be the direction of the last movement, ensuring that no invalid state is reached.
