The code prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `curr_lat` is 90. However, the code itself does not change the values of any variables. It only prints a string based on the condition. The output does not affect the values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90]; `n` is equal to the number of times the loop was executed; `t` is an integer representing the last distance traveled; `dir` is a string representing the direction of the last movement; the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `curr_lat` is 90.**
