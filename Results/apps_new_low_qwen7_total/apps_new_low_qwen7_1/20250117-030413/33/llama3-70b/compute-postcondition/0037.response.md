The code subtracts `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. Since `curr_lat` is within the valid range of [-90, 90] and `t` is an integer, the new value of `curr_lat` will also remain within this range because the division `t / 111.195` results in a small enough value that does not push `curr_lat` outside the valid range. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90] minus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
