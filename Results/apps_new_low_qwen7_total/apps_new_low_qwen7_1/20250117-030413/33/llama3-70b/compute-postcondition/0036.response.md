`curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the code. The value of `t` is used in the calculation, but its specific value is not provided, so it remains as `t`. The variable `dir` is also not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90] and has been updated by adding `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90] and has been updated by adding `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
