Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
  - `curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir` and `t`.
  - If `curr_lat` is exactly 90 and `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90].
  - If `curr_lat` is exactly -90 and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` remains -90.
  - Otherwise, `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90].
  - No other variables are affected.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop statement is:
  ```
  for _ in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop head variables in this case are `_` (a dummy variable) and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
2. **Adjust `curr_lat`**: Since the loop does not directly affect `curr_lat`, we need to consider how `curr_lat` is adjusted in each iteration.
3. **Adjust `n`**: For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the loop condition and the fact that `curr_lat` is only adjusted based on conditions involving `dir` and `t`, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

### Final State
- `curr_lat` remains within the valid range [-90, 90] based on the conditions mentioned.
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90], `n` must be greater than 0**.
