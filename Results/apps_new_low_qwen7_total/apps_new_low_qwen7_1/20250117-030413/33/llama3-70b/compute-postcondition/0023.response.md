`curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. Since `t` is an integer and `111.195` is a constant, `curr_lat` will be updated to its current value plus `t / 111.195`. The other variables (`n`, `dir`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90 + t / 111.195, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
