State: **`curr_lat` is 90, `n` must be greater than 0** 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `curr_lat` is initially 90.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

2. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop uses `range(n)` to determine how many times the loop will execute.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `range(0)` would produce an empty sequence).

3. **Adjust Initial State:**
   - The initial state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged at 90.
   - The initial value of `n` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `curr_lat` is 90
- `n` must be greater than 0
