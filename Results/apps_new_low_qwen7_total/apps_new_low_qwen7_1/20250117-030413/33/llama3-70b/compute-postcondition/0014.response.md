Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is 90, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string. Since the condition `curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90` does not apply (as `curr_lat` is always initialized to 90), the postcondition remains the same as the precondition: `curr_lat` is 90, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string.***
