The code `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` subtracts the value of `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. Since `t` is an integer, the value of `curr_lat` will be updated accordingly. The other variables (`n`, `dir`) remain unchanged.

Given that `curr_lat` initially is 90, let's denote the new value of `curr_lat` as `90 - t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90 - t / 111.195, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
