`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer, and since `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a valid integer, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `curr_lat` will be updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its current value of 90. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is 90 - t / 111.195, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'**
