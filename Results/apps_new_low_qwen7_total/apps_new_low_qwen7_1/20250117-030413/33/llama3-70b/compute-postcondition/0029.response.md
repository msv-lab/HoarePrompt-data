Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir` and `t`. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, it remains unchanged. Specifically, if `dir` is not 'North' or 'South', `curr_lat` is already within the valid range. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is set to 90 + `t` / 111.195, and if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is set to 90 - `t` / 111.195. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string, the final value of `curr_lat` stays within the valid range [-90, 90].***
