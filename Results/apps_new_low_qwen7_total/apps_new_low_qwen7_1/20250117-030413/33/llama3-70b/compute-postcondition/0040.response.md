Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90]. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is reduced by `t / 111.195`. Otherwise, the value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string.***
