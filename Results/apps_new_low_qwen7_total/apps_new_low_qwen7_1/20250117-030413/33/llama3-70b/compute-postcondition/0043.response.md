The provided code snippet contains two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines will execute in sequence. The `print('NO')` line will print 'NO' to the console, and then the `exit()` function will be called, causing the program to terminate immediately without executing any further lines of code.

Given the initial state where `curr_lat` is within the valid range [-90, 90], `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string, none of these variables will be affected by the executed lines of code. The only action performed is printing 'NO' and exiting the program.

Since the program exits immediately after printing 'NO', no further state updates can be made. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **curr_lat is within the valid range [-90, 90], n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string**
