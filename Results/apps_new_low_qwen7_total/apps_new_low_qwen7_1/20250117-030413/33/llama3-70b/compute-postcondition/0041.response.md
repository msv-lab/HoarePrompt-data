Output State: **curr_lat is within the valid range [-90, 90], n is greater than 0, t is an integer, dir is a string, the program prints 'NO' and exits**

Explanation: The code block consists of two lines. The first line prints 'NO'. The second line calls the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately without further execution of the subsequent lines. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`. The program simply prints 'NO' and then stops executing, resulting in the given output state.
