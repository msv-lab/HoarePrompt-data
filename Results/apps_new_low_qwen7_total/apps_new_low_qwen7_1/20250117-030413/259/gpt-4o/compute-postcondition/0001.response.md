Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `half_n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < half_n`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `half_n = n // 2`.
   - `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_question_marks`, and `right_question_marks` are all initialized to 0.
   - `ticket` is a string of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters.
   - The number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even.

4. **Determine Initial Values for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `half_n`.
   - Since `half_n = n // 2`, and `n` is an even integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `half_n` will be at least 1 (since the smallest even integer is 2, making `half_n` 1).

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 or greater, but strictly less than `half_n`. Given that `half_n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `i` to enter the loop is 0.

5. **Final State Before First Loop Execution**:
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `half_n` remains as calculated from `n`.

So, the state before the first execution of the loop must be:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `half_n` is \(n // 2\)**.

Note that the values of `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_question_marks`, `right_question_marks`, and `ticket` do not directly affect the loop condition, so they remain as their initial states.
