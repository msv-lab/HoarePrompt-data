Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the first half of the ticket string. For each iteration, it checks whether the character at the current index is a question mark ('?'). If it is, it increments `left_question_marks`. If not, it adds the integer value of the character to `left_sum`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **`i`**: The loop variable starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `half_n - 1`.
- **`half_n`**: This is initially set as `n // 2` and remains constant throughout the loop.
- **`left_sum`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the integers from the characters in the ticket that are not '?'.
- **`left_question_marks`**: This variable counts the number of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.

### Summary of Loop Behavior
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `half_n - 1`.
- `left_sum` will be the sum of the integer values of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
- `left_question_marks` will be the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.

### Verify Relationships
From the given information, we can confirm that:
- `i` will be `half_n - 1` after the loop ends.
- `half_n` remains unchanged and is `n // 2`.
- `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` will reflect the values accumulated during the loop based on the conditions provided.

### Output State
After the loop has executed for all iterations, the final output state will be:
- `i` will be `n // 2 - 1`.
- `left_sum` will be the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
- `left_question_marks` will be the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is \( n // 2 - 1 \), `left_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket, and `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.**
