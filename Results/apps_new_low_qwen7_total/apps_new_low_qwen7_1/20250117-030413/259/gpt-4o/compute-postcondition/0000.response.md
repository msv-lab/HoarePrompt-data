Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, half_n is n // 2, left_sum is 0, right_sum is 0, left_question_marks is 0, right_question_marks is 0, ticket is a string of length n containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, the number of '?' characters in the ticket is even**

Explanation:
1. The line `half_n = n // 2` calculates half of `n` and assigns it to `half_n`. This is done without changing the value of `n`.
2. The lines `left_sum = 0` and `right_sum = 0` initialize `left_sum` and `right_sum` to 0. These variables are now set to 0.
3. The lines `left_question_marks = 0` and `right_question_marks = 0` initialize `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks` to 0. These variables are now set to 0.
4. The variable `ticket` remains unchanged, being a string of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, with the number of '?' characters being even.

No other variables or the initial state of `n` and `ticket` are affected by the given code block.
