To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the second half of the `ticket` list, starting from index `half_n` up to `n-1`.
   - For each element `ticket[i]`:
     - If `ticket[i]` is `'?'`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**: 
     - The initial value of `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
     - The initial state of `left_sum` and `left_question_marks` does not affect the outcome of the loop.
   - **Variables that change**:
     - `i` increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
     - `right_sum` accumulates the sum of integers in `ticket` where the character is not `'?'`.
     - `right_question_marks` counts the number of `'?'` characters in the second half of `ticket`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
   - `right_sum` will be the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of `ticket`.
   - `right_question_marks` will be the count of '?' characters in the second half of `ticket`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop correctly updates `right_sum` and `right_question_marks` based on the condition of each element in the second half of `ticket`.

Given this analysis, the final state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list, and `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list.**
