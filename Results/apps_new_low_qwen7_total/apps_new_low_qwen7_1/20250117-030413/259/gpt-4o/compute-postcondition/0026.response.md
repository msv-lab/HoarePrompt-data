Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Current State**: 
   - `ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket` and is now `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
   - `right_sum` is increased by either the ASCII value of `ticket[i]` (if `ticket[i]` is not '?') or `right_question_marks` is increased by 1 (if `ticket[i]` is '?'.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (current `i` + 1).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` (current `i + 1` + 1).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, and `right_sum` is increased by either the ASCII value of `ticket[i]` (if `ticket[i]` is not '?') or `right_question_marks` is increased by 1 (if `ticket[i]` is '?'.**
