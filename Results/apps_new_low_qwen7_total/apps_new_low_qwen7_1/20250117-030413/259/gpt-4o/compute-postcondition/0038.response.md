Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even. It calculates the sum of non-'?' characters and counts the '?' characters in two halves of the ticket. Based on these values, it determines whether the ticket can be considered "bicarp" or "monocarp". Specifically, it checks if the difference between the sums of non-'?' characters in the two halves plus half of the '?' characters (multiplied by 9) is divisible by 9. If true, it prints "Bicarp"; otherwise, it prints "Monocarp". The function handles the case where the number of '?' characters is even and ensures all necessary calculations are performed before making the final decision.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is odd or out of the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the function will not execute correctly because the initial condition checks are not present in the code. However, given the problem constraints, `n` should always be even within the specified range.
- If the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is not even, the function will still proceed with the calculation, but the overall logic assumes an even number of '?' characters, which might lead to incorrect results if this assumption is violated.
