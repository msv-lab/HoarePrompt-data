Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list, and `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list.

Code Block:
```
diff = left_sum - right_sum
q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
```

Analysis:
- The first line calculates `diff` as the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`.
- The second line calculates `q_diff` as the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`.

Since the initial state does not include the values of `left_sum`, `left_question_marks`, `ticket`, or the exact length of the list `n`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `diff` and `q_diff`. However, we know that these two new variables are created and populated based on the given conditions.

Final Output State: **i is n-1, right_sum is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, right_question_marks is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, diff is left_sum - right_sum, q_diff is left_question_marks - right_question_marks**
