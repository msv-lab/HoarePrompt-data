The code snippet updates the `right_sum` by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Since `ticket[i]` is a character, its ASCII value is being added to `right_sum`. If `ticket[i]` is '?', it is treated as 0. The value of `i` has already been updated to `i + 1`, so it is no longer `i` but `i + 1`. The states of `n` and `right_question_marks` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket` and its ASCII value is added to `right_sum`; `i` is now `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`; `right_question_marks` remains increased by 1 if `ticket[i]` was '?', otherwise `right_sum` is increased by the ASCII value of `ticket[i]`.**
