The code `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments the value of `right_sum` by converting `ticket[i]` to an integer. Given that `ticket[i]` is a character, converting it to an integer will yield its ASCII value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains valid.

The updated states are:
- `right_sum` is incremented by the ASCII value of `ticket[i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` is still valid.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, and `right_sum` is increased by the ASCII value of `ticket[i]`.**
