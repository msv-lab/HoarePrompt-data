Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables involved are `i` and `half_n`, as well as `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `half_n` to `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be equal to `half_n` and less than `n`.

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is initially set to \( n // 2 - 1 \).
   - `left_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
   - `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.

4. **First Execution Check**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be incremented from its initial value to `half_n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be `half_n` when the loop starts its first iteration.

5. **Adjust Initial State**:
   - Initially, `i` is \( n // 2 - 1 \). To reach `i = half_n` (which is the starting point for the loop), `i` must be incremented once.
   - This means that after the increment, `i` should be `half_n`.

6. **Final State Required for First Execution**:
   - `i` must be `half_n` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - `half_n` is \( \frac{n}{2} \).

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `i` is `half_n`, which is \( \frac{n}{2} \).
- `left_sum` remains the same as the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
- `left_question_marks` remains the same as the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.

**State:**
**`i` is half_n (which is \( \frac{n}{2} \)), `left_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket, `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket**.
