The code updates the variable `left_sum` by adding the integer value of the ticket at index `i`. However, the initial state does not specify what the value of `ticket[i]` is, only that it is not '?'. Since `ticket[i]` could be any value except '?', and we are converting it to an integer and adding it to `left_sum`, the exact value of `left_sum` cannot be determined without knowing `ticket[i]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `half_n` is \(n // 2\), the ticket at index `i` is not '?', and `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `half_n` is \(n // 2\), the ticket at index `i` is not '?', `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[i]`**
