`right_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The value of `ticket[i]` is not specified in the current code, so it remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged since the code does not affect it. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not interact with it. The value of `right_sum` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `right_question_marks` is increased by 1, and `right_sum` is increased by either the ASCII value of `ticket[i]` (if `ticket[i]` is not '?') or `right_question_marks` is increased by 1 (if `ticket[i]` is '?'.**
