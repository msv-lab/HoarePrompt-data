The code `print('Monocarp')` simply prints the string 'Monocarp' to the console. This does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **i is n-1, right_sum is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, right_question_marks is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, diff is left_sum - right_sum, q_diff is left_question_marks - right_question_marks, and ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 != 0)**
