Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `half_n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `half_n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `half_n` is \( n // 2 \)
   - If `ticket[i]` equals '?', then `left_question_marks` is 1. Otherwise, `left_question_marks` remains unchanged.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `half_n` remains unchanged as it is derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `total` remains unchanged as there is no operation affecting it mentioned in the loop body.
   - The value of `left_question_marks` remains unchanged unless `ticket[2]` equals '?', but since we don't know the value of `ticket[2]` from the given information, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `half_n` is \( n // 2 \), `left_question_marks` remains unchanged**.
