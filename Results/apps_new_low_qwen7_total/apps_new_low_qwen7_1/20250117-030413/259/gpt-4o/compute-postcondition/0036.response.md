Postcondition: ***`i` is n-1, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `diff` is `left_sum - right_sum`, `q_diff` is `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`. If `((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0)`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made as well since the else part has the same conditions as the if part.***
