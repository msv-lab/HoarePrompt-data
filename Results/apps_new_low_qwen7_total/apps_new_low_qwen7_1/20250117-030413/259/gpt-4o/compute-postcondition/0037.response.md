The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. 
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the ticket is even.

The function does not directly return a value based on the given output cases, but rather processes the input and may return a value depending on certain conditions. However, following the given structure:

- Case_1: The function checks if the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even. If true, it proceeds to some logic (not detailed here).
- Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met (i.e., the number of '?' characters is not even), the function returns an appropriate value or message (not specified).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of specific characteristics, and based on the evenness of the number of '?' characters in `ticket`, it either proceeds with some logic (Case_1) or returns a value (Case_2).

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even. If the number of '?' characters is even, it performs some logic; otherwise, it returns a value or message.**
