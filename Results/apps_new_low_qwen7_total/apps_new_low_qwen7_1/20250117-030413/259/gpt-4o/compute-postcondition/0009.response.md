The code snippet `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` attempts to add the integer value of `ticket[i]` to the variable `left_sum`. However, there are a few issues here:

1. `left_sum` is not defined in the given initial state.
2. `ticket` is not defined in the given initial state.

Given these points, the code cannot be executed as written because `left_sum` and `ticket` are undefined. Since no valid operations can be performed, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `half_n` is \( n // 2 \)**
