Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `half_n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < half_n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `half_n` is \( n // 2 \).

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - `half_n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` remains 0 because it was not modified in the loop body.
   - `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `half_n` remains \( n // 2 \).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `half_n` is \( n // 2 \)**.
