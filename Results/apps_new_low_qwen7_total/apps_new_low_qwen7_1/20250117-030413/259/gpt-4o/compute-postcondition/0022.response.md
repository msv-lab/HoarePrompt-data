The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the given loop condition `for i in range(half_n, n)`, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`.
- `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket`.
- If `ticket[i]` is equal to '?', then `right_question_marks` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `right_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the range.

Let's assume the value of `half_n` is `a` and the value of `n` is `b`. Therefore, the loop starts with `i = a` and increments `i` until `i < b`.

If `i` was at the maximum value less than `b` (i.e., `i = b - 1`), then the next value of `i` would be `b`.

So, if `i` was at the end of the previous iteration and was less than `n`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`ticket[i]` is a character within the list `ticket`, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ticket` and `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
