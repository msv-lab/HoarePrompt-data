`left_question_marks` is incremented by 1. The value of `left_question_marks` was initially 0 (since it is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it starts at 0). The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `half_n` is \( n // 2 \); `left_question_marks` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `half_n` is \( n // 2 \); `left_question_marks` is 1**
