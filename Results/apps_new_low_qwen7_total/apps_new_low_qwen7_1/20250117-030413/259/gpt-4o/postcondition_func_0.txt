The function `func_1` accepts an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even. It calculates the sum of non-'?' characters and counts the '?' characters in two halves of the ticket. Based on these values, it determines whether the ticket can be considered "bicarp" or "monocarp". Specifically, it checks if the difference between the sums of non-'?' characters in the two halves plus half of the '?' characters (multiplied by 9) is divisible by 9. If true, it prints "Bicarp"; otherwise, it prints "Monocarp". The function handles the case where the number of '?' characters is even and ensures all necessary calculations are performed before making the final decision.
