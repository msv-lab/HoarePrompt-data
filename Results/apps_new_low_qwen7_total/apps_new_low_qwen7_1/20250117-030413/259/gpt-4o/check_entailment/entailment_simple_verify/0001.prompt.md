You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
func_1(n, ticket)

def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2
    left_sum = 0
    right_sum = 0
    left_question_marks = 0
    right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
    diff = left_sum - right_sum
    q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if (diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0:
        print('Bicarp')
    else:
        print('Monocarp')



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
func_1(n, ticket)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and ticket is a string of length n containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the ticket is even.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2

left_sum = 0

left_question_marks = 0

right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is \( n // 2 - 1 \), `left_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket, and `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-1`, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list, and `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list.
    diff = left_sum - right_sum

q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0) :
        print('Bicarp')
    else :
        print('Monocarp')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is n-1, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `diff` is `left_sum - right_sum`, `q_diff` is `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`. If `((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0)`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made as well since the else part has the same conditions as the if part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to check if the logic implemented matches the requirements of the game and the conditions for winning.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of digits `n` and the ticket string.
2. **Splitting and Summing**: It splits the ticket into two halves and sums the digits and counts the question marks in each half.
3. **Calculating Differences**: It calculates the difference between the sums of the digits and the differences in the number of question marks.
4. **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the adjusted difference is divisible by 9. This is because if the sum of the first half can be made equal to the sum of the second half by replacing question marks appropriately, the total difference must be a multiple of 9 (since each replacement can change the sum by at most 9).

The logic is sound because:
- If the adjusted difference is a multiple of 9, it means Bicarp can always make the ticket happy by replacing question marks optimally.
- If not, Monocarp can prevent Bicarp from making the ticket happy by strategically replacing question marks.

Given the logic, the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy of both players.
