You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
func_1(n, ticket)

def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2
    left_sum = 0
    right_sum = 0
    left_question_marks = 0
    right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
    diff = left_sum - right_sum
    q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if (diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0:
        print('Bicarp')
    else:
        print('Monocarp')

func_1(n, ticket)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and ticket is a string of length n containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the ticket is even.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2

            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is \( n // 2 - 1 \), `left_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the first half of the ticket, and `left_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the first half of the ticket.
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-1`, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list, and `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the `ticket` list.
    diff = left_sum - right_sum

q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0) :
        print('Bicarp')
    else :
        print('Monocarp')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is n-1, `right_sum` is the sum of all non-'?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `right_question_marks` is the count of '?' characters in the second half of the ticket list, `diff` is `left_sum - right_sum`, `q_diff` is `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`. If `((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0)`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made as well since the else part has the same conditions as the if part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits from '0' to '9' and '?' characters, where the number of '?' characters is even. It calculates the sum of non-'?' characters and counts the '?' characters in two halves of the ticket. Based on these values, it determines whether the ticket can be considered "bicarp" or "monocarp". Specifically, it checks if the difference between the sums of non-'?' characters in the two halves plus half of the '?' characters (multiplied by 9) is divisible by 9. If true, it prints "Bicarp"; otherwise, it prints "Monocarp". The function handles the case where the number of '?' characters is even and ensures all necessary calculations are performed before making the final decision.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Monocarp and Bicarp. The logic in `func_1` checks if the ticket can be made happy by replacing question marks, but it does not simulate the turns of the game where each player tries to prevent the other from winning.

Here is a counterexample where the program incorrectly determines the winner:

**Input:**
```
6
?00?0?
```

**Expected Output:**
- Bicarp should win because Monocarp cannot prevent Bicarp from making the ticket happy. No matter how Monocarp replaces the question marks, Bicarp can always replace them in such a way that the sums of the two halves become equal.

**Actual Output:**
- The program outputs "Monocarp".

The program fails to consider the optimal moves of both players. It only checks if the ticket can be made happy without considering the turns and optimal strategies of the players. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
