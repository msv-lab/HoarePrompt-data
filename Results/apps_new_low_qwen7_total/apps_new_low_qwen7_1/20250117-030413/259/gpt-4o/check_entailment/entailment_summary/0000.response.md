Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic used in the `func_1` function correctly identifies whether Bicarp can always make the ticket happy or not, assuming both players play optimally.

1. **Sum Calculation**: The function correctly separates the ticket into two halves and calculates the sum of non-'?' digits and counts the '?' characters in each half.
2. **Difference Calculation**: The difference (`diff`) between the sums of the first half and the second half is calculated.
3. **Question Mark Handling**: The difference due to the '?' characters (`q_diff`) is calculated. Each '?' can be replaced with any digit from 0 to 9, contributing up to 9 to the sum. The function uses `q_diff // 2 * 9` to account for the maximum possible adjustment by replacing half of the '?' characters optimally.
4. **Divisibility Check**: The condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` checks if the adjusted sum difference is divisible by 9. This is a crucial step because the sum of digits of a number being divisible by 9 means the sums of the two halves can be made equal by optimally filling the '?' characters.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the function correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the given conditions. Therefore, the logic appears sound and should work correctly under optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
