Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Monocarp and Bicarp. The logic in `func_1` checks if the ticket can be made happy by replacing question marks, but it does not simulate the turns of the game where each player tries to prevent the other from winning.

Here is a counterexample where the program incorrectly determines the winner:

**Input:**
```
6
?00?0?
```

**Expected Output:**
- Bicarp should win because Monocarp cannot prevent Bicarp from making the ticket happy. No matter how Monocarp replaces the question marks, Bicarp can always replace them in such a way that the sums of the two halves become equal.

**Actual Output:**
- The program outputs "Monocarp".

The program fails to consider the optimal moves of both players. It only checks if the ticket can be made happy without considering the turns and optimal strategies of the players. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
