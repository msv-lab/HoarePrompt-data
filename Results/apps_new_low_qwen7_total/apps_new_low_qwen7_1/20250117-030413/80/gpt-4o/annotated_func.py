#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\) and p is an integer representing the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `p` as parameters. It calculates and returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using the built-in `pow` function. The function ensures that the calculation respects the modulus \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `p` is less than 3 (since \(p-2\) would be negative or zero), in which case the function should raise a ValueError. However, the provided code does not handle this edge case explicitly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7. `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, MOD) for all i from 1 to m, taken modulo MOD, and i is m + 1.
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns m * length_sum % MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\). It returns either 1 or \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \% \text{MOD}\) based on the value of `m`. Specifically, if `m` is 1, it directly returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of `func_1(i, \text{MOD})` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, takes this sum modulo \(\text{MOD}\), multiplies it by `m`, and returns the result modulo \(\text{MOD}\).

In the case where `m` is 1, the function returns 1 immediately without entering the for loop. In all other cases, the function computes the sum of `func_1(i, \text{MOD})` for each `i` from 1 to `m`, updates `length_sum` accordingly, and finally returns \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \% \text{MOD}\).
