To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

Given:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\)
- `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\)
- `length_sum` is 0

Loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` taking the value 1, as specified by `range(1, m + 1)`.

2. **Condition Check**: The loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true initially.

3. **Variables Involved**: The only variables involved in the loop header are `i` and `m`.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1.

5. **Initial Value of `m`**: `m` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\).

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`length_sum` and `MOD`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition but might be used inside the loop body. However, they do not affect whether the loop executes the first time.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
