The code initializes the variable `length_sum` to 0. This does not affect the value of `m` or `MOD`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `length_sum`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7; `length_sum` is 0.**
