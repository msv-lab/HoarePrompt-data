The code `result = m * length_sum % MOD` multiplies `m` by `length_sum` and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. This means `result` is now the product of `m` and `length_sum` modulo `MOD`. The variables `i` and `func_1(i, MOD)` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `m` remains unchanged (still an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000)
- `length_sum` remains unchanged (the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, taken modulo `MOD`)
- `result` is assigned the value of `m * length_sum % MOD`

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, taken modulo `MOD`, and `result` is `m * length_sum % MOD`**
