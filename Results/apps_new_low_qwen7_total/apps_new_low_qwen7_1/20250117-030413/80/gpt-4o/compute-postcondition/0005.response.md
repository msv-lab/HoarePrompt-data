Output State: **m must be greater than or equal to 1, i is 2, length_sum is length_sum plus func_1(1, MOD) modulo MOD**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `m` being greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1.
- The first line executes `length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)`, which means `length_sum` is incremented by the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` where `i` is 1. The exact value of `length_sum` before this operation is not specified, so we denote it as `length_sum`.
- After the increment, `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD`.
- The second line does not modify any variables, so `m` and `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the final state is that `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is now 2 (since the initial value of `i` was 1 and no change was applied), and `length_sum` is updated to `length_sum + func_1(1, MOD) % MOD`.
