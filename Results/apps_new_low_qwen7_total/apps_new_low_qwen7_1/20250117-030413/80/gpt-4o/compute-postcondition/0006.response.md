Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `length_sum` is `length_sum` plus `func_1(1, MOD)` modulo `MOD`.

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```
  for i in range(1, m + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

2. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[1, m]`.
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (if it is within the range).

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `m + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 3, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 3.
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `length_sum` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.

### Final State:

State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `length_sum` is `length_sum` plus `func_1(1, MOD)` modulo `MOD`**
