Output State: **m must be greater than or equal to 1, i is 4, length_sum is (length_sum + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 3.
- The first line increases `length_sum` by the result of `func_1(i, MOD)`, which is `func_1(3, MOD)`.
- The second line ensures that `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact value of `func_1(3, MOD)` is not provided, we keep it as part of the expression for `length_sum`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 4. Therefore, the final state includes these updated values and the modified `length_sum` expression.
