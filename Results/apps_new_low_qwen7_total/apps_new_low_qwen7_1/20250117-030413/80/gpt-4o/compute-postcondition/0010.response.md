Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. In each iteration, it updates `length_sum` by adding the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Variable `m`**: The value of `m` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. It is the upper limit of the range in the `for` loop.
- **Variable `length_sum`**: This variable is updated in each iteration by adding the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Therefore, `length_sum` changes with each iteration.
- **Variable `i`**: This variable starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m`. Thus, `i` takes values from 1 to `m` sequentially.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will execute exactly `m` times if `m` is a positive integer. After each iteration, `length_sum` is updated as follows:
\[ \text{length_sum} = \left(\text{length_sum} + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func}_1(i, \text{MOD})\right) \mod \text{MOD} \]

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Given the output states after the first few iterations, we can generalize that after `m` iterations, the value of `length_sum` will be:
\[ \text{length_sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func}_1(i, \text{MOD}) \mod \text{MOD} \]

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `m` times), the variables will have the following values:
- `m`: The original value provided.
- `length_sum`: The sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, taken modulo `MOD`.
- `i`: The last value of `i` would be `m + 1`, but since the loop condition is `i < m + 1`, `i` does not get incremented beyond `m` inside the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, MOD) for all i from 1 to m, taken modulo MOD, and i is m + 1.**
