Output State: **m must be greater than or equal to 4, i is 7, length_sum is (length_sum + func_1(7, MOD) + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `m` being greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, and `length_sum` is `(length_sum + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD`.
- The first line of the code block updates `length_sum` by adding `func_1(i, MOD)` to it. Since `i` is 5, this becomes `func_1(5, MOD)`. Therefore, `length_sum` is now `(length_sum + func_1(4, MOD) + func_1(5, MOD)) % MOD`.
- The second line ensures that `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD`, but since the expression already includes a modulo operation, no further change is made.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in the process, so `i` becomes 6. However, since the code block does not explicitly increment `i` to 6, we infer the change in the context of the next potential iteration or usage of `i`.
- Given the instructions, we assume `i` should be updated to reflect the final value within the context of the code block's execution, which would be 7 if considering the sequential execution impact.
- No other variables are affected by the given code block.
