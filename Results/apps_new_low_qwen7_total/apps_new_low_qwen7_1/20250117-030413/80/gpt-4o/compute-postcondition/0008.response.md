Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`, and it ranges from `1` to `m + 1`.

2. **Understand the initial states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is currently 4.
   - `length_sum` is `(length_sum + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue if `m` is greater than or equal to 4.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the current iteration, `i` will be 5.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still satisfy the condition `m >= 4`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` will be 5.
- `length_sum` remains as `(length_sum + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD` since the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `length_sum` in this context.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `length_sum` is `(length_sum + func_1(4, MOD)) % MOD`**
