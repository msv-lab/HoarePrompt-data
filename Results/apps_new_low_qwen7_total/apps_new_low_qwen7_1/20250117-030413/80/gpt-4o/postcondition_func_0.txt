The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `p` as parameters. It calculates and returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using the built-in `pow` function. The function ensures that the calculation respects the modulus \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `p` is less than 3 (since \(p-2\) would be negative or zero), in which case the function should raise a ValueError. However, the provided code does not handle this edge case explicitly.
