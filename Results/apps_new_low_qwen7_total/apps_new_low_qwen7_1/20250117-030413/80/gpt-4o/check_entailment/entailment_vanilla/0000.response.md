Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided.

### Analysis of the Algorithm

1. **Algorithm Description**: 
   - Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer \( x \) from \( 1 \) to \( m \) to the array \( a \).
   - He computes the GCD of all elements in \( a \). If the GCD is \( 1 \), he stops; otherwise, he continues appending.
   - We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The expected length of the array \( a \) is related to the probability of when the GCD becomes \( 1 \). This happens when at least one of the appended numbers is relatively prime to all previously appended numbers.
   - For \( m = 1 \), the expected length is \( 1 \) because the only possible number is \( 1 \), and the GCD is always \( 1 \).
   - For larger \( m \), the expected length involves summing probabilities over all possible sequences until the GCD is \( 1 \).

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, p)`: This function calculates \( a^{(p-2)} \mod p \), which is equivalent to the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( p \) if \( a \) and \( p \) are coprime.
   - `func_2(m)`: This function calculates the expected length of the array based on the provided formula.

### Implementation Check

- **Base Case Handling**: 
  - When \( m = 1 \), the function correctly returns \( 1 \).

- **Loop and Summation**:
  - The loop iterates over all numbers from \( 1 \) to \( m \).
  - For each number \( i \), it calculates the modular inverse of \( i \) using `func_1(i, MOD)`.
  - It sums these inverses multiplied by \( i \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The result is calculated as \( m \times \text{(sum of inverses)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Correctness Verification

- The modular inverse calculation is done correctly using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
- The summation and multiplication operations handle the required arithmetic correctly.
- The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result stays within the valid range for large values.

Based on the above analysis, the provided implementation matches the described algorithm and handles the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
