You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
m = int(input().strip())
print(func_2(m))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\) and p is an integer representing the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7. `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, MOD) for all i from 1 to m, taken modulo MOD, and i is m + 1.
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns m * length_sum % MOD`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the expected length of the array \(a\). The logic in `func_2` does not match the described algorithm. Specifically, the program does not simulate the process of repeatedly appending random integers until the GCD of the array becomes 1, and then calculating the expected length of the array.

The function `func_2` seems to be attempting to compute a sum related to modular inverses but does not properly model the probabilistic nature of the problem. For instance, consider \(m = 2\):

- According to the problem description, the expected length should be 2 because each time a 1 or 2 is appended, the GCD will eventually become 1 after at most two steps, leading to an expected length of 2.
- However, the provided function calculates something different and returns 2, which might be coincidentally correct for this specific input due to the implementation's flaws.

To properly solve this problem, a simulation approach would be necessary, where we simulate the process multiple times to approximate the expected length or derive the formula analytically based on the properties of GCD and uniform distribution. The current implementation does not capture these aspects correctly.
