Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Description and Key Insights

1. **Algorithm Description**:
   - Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer \( x \) from \( 1 \) to \( m \) to the array \( a \).
   - He computes the GCD of all elements in \( a \). If the GCD is \( 1 \), he stops; otherwise, he continues appending.
   - We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The expected length of the array \( a \) depends on the probability of the GCD becoming \( 1 \).
   - For \( m = 1 \), the expected length is \( 1 \) because the only possible number is \( 1 \), and the GCD is always \( 1 \).
   - For larger \( m \), the expected length involves summing probabilities over all possible sequences until the GCD is \( 1 \).

### Given Functions

- **Function 1 (`func_1(a, p)`)**:
  - This function calculates the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( p \) using the formula \( a^{(p-2)} \mod p \).

- **Function 2 (`func_2(m)`)**:
  - This function calculates the expected length of the array \( a \) based on the formula:
    - If \( m = 1 \), it directly returns \( 1 \).
    - Otherwise, it calculates the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for all integers \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( m \), takes this sum modulo \( \text{MOD} \), multiplies it by \( m \), and returns the result modulo \( \text{MOD} \).

### Implementation Check

- **Base Case Handling**:
  - When \( m = 1 \), the function correctly returns \( 1 \).

- **Loop and Summation**:
  - The loop iterates over all numbers from \( 1 \) to \( m \).
  - For each number \( i \), it calculates the modular inverse of \( i \) using `func_1(i, MOD)`.
  - It sums these inverses multiplied by \( i \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The result is calculated as \( m \times \text{(sum of inverses)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Correctness Verification

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1(a, p)` uses `pow(a, p - 2, p)` to calculate the modular inverse, which is correct.

- **Summation and Multiplication**:
  - The summation of modular inverses is correctly handled, and the final multiplication and modulo operation ensure the result stays within the valid range.

- **Use of Modulo**:
  - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the intermediate and final results stay within the valid range, especially for large values of \( m \).

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of the problem constraints and requirements, the provided implementation matches the described algorithm and handles the problem correctly.

Final: **True**

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
