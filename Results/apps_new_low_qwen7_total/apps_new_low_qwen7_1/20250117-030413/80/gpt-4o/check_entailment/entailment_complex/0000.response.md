Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the required logic and that they collectively meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is defined as the value \(b\) such that \((a \cdot b) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1\).
   - The implementation uses the `pow` function with three arguments: base `a`, exponent `p-2`, and modulus \(10^9 + 7\). This correctly computes \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - Edge cases (e.g., when `p` is less than 3) are not handled explicitly, but given the context of the problem and the input constraints (where `p` is effectively `10^9 + 7`), this should not cause issues because the exponent `p-2` will always be positive and within the valid range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the expected length of the array \(a\) based on the given problem statement.
   - If `m` is 1, it directly returns 1, which matches the problem's initial condition.
   - For \(m > 1\), it iterates over each integer from 1 to `m`, computes the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer using `func_1`, sums these values, and then multiplies the sum by `m` before taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The summation and multiplication operations are correctly performed, and the final result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem's constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the program appears to correctly calculate the expected length of the array \(a\) according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
