Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the expected length of the array \(a\). The logic in `func_2` does not match the described algorithm. Specifically, the program does not simulate the process of repeatedly appending random integers until the GCD of the array becomes 1, and then calculating the expected length of the array.

The function `func_2` seems to be attempting to compute a sum related to modular inverses but does not properly model the probabilistic nature of the problem. For instance, consider \(m = 2\):

- According to the problem description, the expected length should be 2 because each time a 1 or 2 is appended, the GCD will eventually become 1 after at most two steps, leading to an expected length of 2.
- However, the provided function calculates something different and returns 2, which might be coincidentally correct for this specific input due to the implementation's flaws.

To properly solve this problem, a simulation approach would be necessary, where we simulate the process multiple times to approximate the expected length or derive the formula analytically based on the properties of GCD and uniform distribution. The current implementation does not capture these aspects correctly.
