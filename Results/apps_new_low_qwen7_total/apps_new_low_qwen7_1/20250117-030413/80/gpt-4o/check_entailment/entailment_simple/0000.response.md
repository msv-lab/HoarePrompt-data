Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the expected length of the array `a` under certain conditions involving appending random integers and computing their gcd until it equals 1. The output needs to be in a specific modular form.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` calculates the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using Fermat's Little Theorem.
   - `func_2` computes the expected length of the array `a` when the initial integer `m` is given.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the modular inverse of `i` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(i, MOD - 2, MOD)`, which is the correct way to find the modular inverse when `MOD` is a prime number (as \(10^9 + 7\) is a prime).

4. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `m` is 1, returning 1.
   - For `m > 1`, it iterates over all integers from 1 to `m`, computes the modular inverse of each using `func_1`, sums these values, and multiplies the result by `m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This approach seems logically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

5. **Execution State Analysis**:
   - The program correctly uses the defined functions and follows the logic outlined in the problem statement.
   - The modular arithmetic operations and the handling of edge cases (like when `m` is 1) appear to be implemented correctly.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
