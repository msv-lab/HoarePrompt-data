You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
m = int(input().strip())
print(func_2(m))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the modulus \(10^9 + 7\) and p is an integer representing the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `p` as parameters. It calculates and returns the result of \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) using the built-in `pow` function. The function ensures that the calculation respects the modulus \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `p` is less than 3 (since \(p-2\) would be negative or zero), in which case the function should raise a ValueError. However, the provided code does not handle this edge case explicitly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7. `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, MOD) for all i from 1 to m, taken modulo MOD, and i is m + 1.
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns m * length_sum % MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` where \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\). It returns either 1 or \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \% \text{MOD}\) based on the value of `m`. Specifically, if `m` is 1, it directly returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of `func_1(i, \text{MOD})` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m`, takes this sum modulo \(\text{MOD}\), multiplies it by `m`, and returns the result modulo \(\text{MOD}\).

In the case where `m` is 1, the function returns 1 immediately without entering the for loop. In all other cases, the function computes the sum of `func_1(i, \text{MOD})` for each `i` from 1 to `m`, updates `length_sum` accordingly, and finally returns \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \% \text{MOD}\).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided.

### Analysis of the Algorithm

1. **Algorithm Description**: 
   - Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer \( x \) from \( 1 \) to \( m \) to the array \( a \).
   - He computes the GCD of all elements in \( a \). If the GCD is \( 1 \), he stops; otherwise, he continues appending.
   - We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The expected length of the array \( a \) is related to the probability of when the GCD becomes \( 1 \). This happens when at least one of the appended numbers is relatively prime to all previously appended numbers.
   - For \( m = 1 \), the expected length is \( 1 \) because the only possible number is \( 1 \), and the GCD is always \( 1 \).
   - For larger \( m \), the expected length involves summing probabilities over all possible sequences until the GCD is \( 1 \).

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, p)`: This function calculates \( a^{(p-2)} \mod p \), which is equivalent to the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( p \) if \( a \) and \( p \) are coprime.
   - `func_2(m)`: This function calculates the expected length of the array based on the provided formula.

### Implementation Check

- **Base Case Handling**: 
  - When \( m = 1 \), the function correctly returns \( 1 \).

- **Loop and Summation**:
  - The loop iterates over all numbers from \( 1 \) to \( m \).
  - For each number \( i \), it calculates the modular inverse of \( i \) using `func_1(i, MOD)`.
  - It sums these inverses multiplied by \( i \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The result is calculated as \( m \times \text{(sum of inverses)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Correctness Verification

- The modular inverse calculation is done correctly using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
- The summation and multiplication operations handle the required arithmetic correctly.
- The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result stays within the valid range for large values.

Based on the above analysis, the provided implementation matches the described algorithm and handles the problem correctly.
