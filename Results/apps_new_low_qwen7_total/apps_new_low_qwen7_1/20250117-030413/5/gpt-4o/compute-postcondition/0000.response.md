The provided code snippet reads two inputs, assigns them to `x`, `hh`, and `mm`, and initializes `snooze_count` to 0. However, the code does not perform any operations or updates to the values of `x`, `hh`, `mm`, or `snooze_count`. Therefore, the values remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 60\).
- `hh` and `mm` are integers representing hours and minutes respectively, where \(00 \leq hh \leq 23\) and \(00 \leq mm \leq 59\).
- `func_1(hh, mm)` is a boolean function that returns `True` if the time represented by `hh:mm` contains the digit '7' and `False` otherwise.

After executing the code block, the values remain the same:
- `x` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 60\).
- `hh` and `mm` remain integers within their respective ranges.
- `snooze_count` is still 0.

Output State: **x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 60, hh and mm are integers representing hours and minutes respectively where 00 ≤ hh ≤ 23 and 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59, and snooze_count is 0**.
