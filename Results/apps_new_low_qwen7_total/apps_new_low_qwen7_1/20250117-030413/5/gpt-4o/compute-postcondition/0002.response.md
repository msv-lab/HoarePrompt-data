Output State: **snooze_count is 1, mm is mm - x, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 60**

Explanation:
- The first line increases `snooze_count` by 1. Given that the initial value of `snooze_count` is 0, after this line, `snooze_count` becomes 1.
- The second line decreases `mm` by the value of `x`. The initial value of `mm` is a specific integer between 00 and 59. After subtracting `x` (which is also an integer between 1 and 60), the new value of `mm` is `mm - x`. The value of `x` itself is not changed by this operation.
