Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `not func_1(hh, mm)` is true, which means `func_1(hh, mm)` must return a truthy value (typically `True`) for the loop to continue.

2. **Understand the function `func_1(hh, mm)`**: Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we assume it takes two parameters (`hh` and `mm`) and returns a boolean value. For the loop to continue, `func_1(hh, mm)` must evaluate to `False`.

3. **Initial states of the variables**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 60\)
   - `hh` and `mm` are integers representing hours and minutes respectively, where \(00 \leq hh \leq 23\) and \(00 \leq mm \leq 59\)
   - `snooze_count` is 0

4. **Determine the necessary conditions**:
   - Since the loop continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`, the initial values of `hh` and `mm` must be such that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.
   - There are no specific constraints given on the values of `hh` and `mm` that would make `func_1(hh, mm)` return `False` in this context, so we focus on ensuring the loop can enter at least once.

Given that `snooze_count` is 0, and assuming the function `func_1` might check for some specific conditions involving `hh` and `mm`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This implies that the initial values of `hh` and `mm` should be such that they do not immediately satisfy the condition `func_1(hh, mm)`, allowing the loop to iterate at least once.

Therefore, the initial states of the variables do not need to be changed; the loop can proceed based on the given constraints.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 60\), `hh` and `mm` are integers representing hours and minutes respectively where \(00 \leq hh \leq 23\) and \(00 \leq mm \leq 59\), and `snooze_count` is 0**
