The initial state is as follows: `snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is \(59 - x\), and `hh` is 23.

Let's analyze the code block:

```python
mm += 60
hh -= 1
```

### First Line: `mm += 60`
- `mm` initially is \(59 - x\).
- Adding 60 to `mm` gives \(59 - x + 60 = 119 - x\).

### Second Line: `hh -= 1`
- `hh` initially is 23.
- Subtracting 1 from `hh` gives \(23 - 1 = 22\).

No other variables are affected by these lines.

### Final State
- `snooze_count` remains unchanged at 2.
- `mm` is now \(119 - x\).
- `hh` is now 22.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **snooze_count is 2, mm is 119 - x, hh is 22**
