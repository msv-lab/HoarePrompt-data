Output State: **snooze_count is 3, mm is 119 - x, hh is 46**

Explanation:
- The first line `snooze_count += 1` increments the value of `snooze_count` by 1. Given that `snooze_count` initially is 2, it becomes 3.
- The second line `mm -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `mm`. Given that `mm` initially is `119 - x`, it becomes `119 - 2x` (since `snooze_count` was incremented by 1, making it 3, and the initial value of `mm` was `119 - x`).

Therefore, the final state includes `snooze_count` being 3, `mm` being `119 - 2x`, and `hh` remaining unchanged at 46.
