The initial state is as follows: `snooze_count` is 3, `mm` is `119 - x`, and `hh` is 46.

The code block is:
```
mm += 60
hh -= 1
```

- The first line `mm += 60` adds 60 to the current value of `mm`. Since `mm` is initially `119 - x`, it becomes `119 - x + 60`, which simplifies to `179 - x`.
- The second line `hh -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `hh`. Since `hh` is initially 46, it becomes 45.

No other variables are affected by these lines. Therefore, the final state is:

Output State: **snooze_count is 3, mm is 179 - x, hh is 45**
