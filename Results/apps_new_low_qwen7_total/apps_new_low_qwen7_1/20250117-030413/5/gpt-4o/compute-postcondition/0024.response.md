Functionality: **The function `func_2` simulates a countdown timer that starts from the given time `hh:mm` and decrements the minutes by `x` until the time contains the digit '7' according to the function `func_1`. It keeps track of the number of times the timer decrements (`snooze_count`). If the minutes go below zero, it wraps around to the next hour. After the loop ends, it prints the number of times the timer was decremented.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True` immediately without entering the loop, the function will still print `0` because no decrement operation is performed.
- If `mm` becomes negative due to decrementing by `x`, it correctly wraps around to the next hour by adjusting `mm` and `hh`.
- If `hh` becomes negative due to decrementing, it correctly wraps around to the next day by adjusting `hh`.
- The function assumes that `func_1` will always eventually return `True` and the loop will terminate. If `func_1` never returns `True`, the function will enter an infinite loop, which is not handled by the current code.
