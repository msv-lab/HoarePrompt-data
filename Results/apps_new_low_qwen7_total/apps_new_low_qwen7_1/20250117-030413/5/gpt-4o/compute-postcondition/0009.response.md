Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while not func_1(hh, mm)`. This means the loop continues as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

2. **Current States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `snooze_count` is 1.
   - `mm` is adjusted based on the condition: if `mm` is less than 0, then `mm` becomes 59 and `hh` is set to 23. If `mm` is not less than 0, the values of `mm` and `hh` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`.
   - To ensure `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False` in the next iteration, we need to ensure that the input to `func_1` remains such that it does not meet the condition for returning `True`.

4. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - Since `func_1` is an unknown function, we cannot directly manipulate its logic. However, we can ensure that the inputs `hh` and `mm` are in a state where `func_1(hh, mm)` might return `False`.
   - The only variables directly controlled by the given conditions are `mm` and `hh`. Therefore, we need to ensure these variables are in a state where `func_1(hh, mm)` would return `False`.

Given the adjustment rule for `mm` and `hh`:
- If `mm` is less than 0, `mm` becomes 59 and `hh` becomes 23.
- Otherwise, `mm` and `hh` remain unchanged.

Since we need to ensure the loop continues, we should ensure `mm` and `hh` are in a state where `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can assume that the worst-case scenario for continuing the loop is when `mm` and `hh` are adjusted to their maximum possible values (23 and 59, respectively).

Thus, the next state should ensure that `mm` and `hh` are in a state where they could still trigger the adjustment but not necessarily return `True` from `func_1`.

State: **`snooze_count` is 1, `mm` is 59, `hh` is 23**
