Output State: **snooze_count is 2, mm is 59 - x, hh is 23**

Explanation:
- The first line increments `snooze_count` by 1, so `snooze_count` becomes 2.
- The second line subtracts `x` from `mm`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the code snippet or the initial state, so `mm` is updated to `59 - x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we leave it as `59 - x` in the final state. All other variables (`hh`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
