Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop continues to execute as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. During each iteration, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, `mm` is decreased by `x`, and if `mm` becomes negative, `mm` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 59] by adding 60, and `hh` is decreased by 1. If `hh` becomes negative, it is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23] by adding 24.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified inside the loop.
- **Variable `snooze_count`**: Increases by 1 in each iteration.
- **Variable `mm`**: Decreases by `x` in each iteration, and if it goes below 0, it is adjusted by adding 60.
- **Variable `hh`**: Decreases by 1 in each iteration, but is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23] if it goes below 0.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues to run until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`. Each iteration decreases `mm` by `x`, and if `mm` goes below 0, it is adjusted to be within the range [0, 59], and `hh` is decreased by 1. If `hh` goes below 0, it is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23].

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
To find the final state after the loop, we need to determine the total decrease in `mm` and `hh` after `n` iterations, where `n` is the number of times the loop executes. The final values of `mm` and `hh` will depend on the cumulative effect of subtracting `x` from `mm` and adjusting `hh` when necessary.

Given the output states:
- After 1 iteration: `snooze_count` is 1, `mm` is adjusted to 59 if `mm` was less than 0, otherwise `mm` is unchanged.
- After 2 iterations: `snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is `119 - x`.
- After 3 iterations: `snooze_count` is 3, `mm` is `179 - x`.

From this, we can infer that after `n` iterations, `snooze_count` is `n`, and `mm` is `(60 * n) - x`. This is because each iteration decreases `mm` by `x` and if `mm` goes below 0, it is adjusted by adding 60.

The final values of `mm` and `hh` can be calculated as follows:
- `mm = (60 * snooze_count) - x`
- To find `hh`, we need to adjust `mm` to be within the range [0, 59]. If `mm` is less than 0, `hh` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23].

### Final Output State
After the loop has finished executing, the final state will be:
- `snooze_count` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `mm` is `(60 * snooze_count) - x`.
- `hh` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23] based on the value of `mm`.

Since the exact number of iterations (`snooze_count`) is not specified, we express the final state in terms of `snooze_count`:

Output State: **snooze_count is the number of iterations the loop executed, mm is (60 * snooze_count) - x, and hh is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23] based on the value of mm.**
