The loop condition is `not func_1(hh, mm)`. This means that the loop continues as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `snooze_count` is 2
- `mm` is 119 - x
- `hh` is 46

Since the loop continues based on the function `func_1(hh, mm)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False` again. Therefore, the values of `hh` and `mm` need to be such that `func_1(46, 119 - x)` returns `False`.

However, since we cannot assume anything about the function `func_1`, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to keep the same values for `hh` and `mm` because we know that with these values, the loop did not exit.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `hh` and `mm` to ensure the loop continues. Given the current values, we should keep `hh` as 46 and `mm` as 119 - x.

State: **`snooze_count` is 2, `mm` is 119 - x, and `hh` is 46**
