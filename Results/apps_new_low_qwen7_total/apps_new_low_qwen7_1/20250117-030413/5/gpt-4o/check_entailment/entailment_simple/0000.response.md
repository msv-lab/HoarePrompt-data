Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines `func_1` to check if a given time contains the digit '7'.
2. The main function `func_2` reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
3. It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
4. A while loop continues until the time `hh:mm` is lucky (contains the digit '7').
5. In each iteration of the loop:
   - The snooze count is incremented.
   - The minutes `mm` are decreased by `x`.
   - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes and decrementing the hour `hh` by one. If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next day by adding 24 hours.
6. Once a lucky time is found, the loop exits, and the total number of snoozes is printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until he reaches a lucky time.

Correctness: **True**
