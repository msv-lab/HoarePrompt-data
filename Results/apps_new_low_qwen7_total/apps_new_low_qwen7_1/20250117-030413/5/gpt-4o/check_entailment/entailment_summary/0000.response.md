Reasoning:
1. The `func_1` function correctly checks if a given time contains the digit '7'. This function will be used to determine if the current time meets the condition.
2. The `func_2` function properly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button. It:
   - Takes the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - Initializes a counter `snooze_count` to keep track of the number of snoozes.
   - Uses a while loop to decrement the minutes by `x` and checks if the new time is lucky using `func_1`.
   - Wraps around to the next hour if the minutes go below zero.
   - Continues this process until a lucky time is found.
3. The logic in `func_2` accurately reflects the problem statement and constraints.
4. There are no apparent logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Given the above reasoning, the program should work as intended and meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
