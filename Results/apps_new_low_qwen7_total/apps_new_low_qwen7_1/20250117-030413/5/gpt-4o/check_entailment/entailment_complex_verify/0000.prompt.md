You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    x = int(input())
    (hh, mm) = map(int, input().split())
    snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        mm -= x
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
    print(snooze_count)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h and m are integers representing hours and minutes respectively, such that 0 <= h <= 23 and 0 <= m <= 59. The function checks if the time h:m contains the digit '7'.
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)
    #The program returns True if either the hour 'h' or the minute 'm' contains the digit '7', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `m`, which represent hours and minutes respectively, with constraints 0 ≤ h ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 59. It checks whether either the hour `h` or the minute `m` contains the digit '7'. If either `h` or `m` contains the digit '7', the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, but the function correctly handles valid inputs within the specified range.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 60, hh and mm are integers representing hours and minutes respectively where 00 ≤ hh ≤ 23 and 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59, and func_1(hh, mm) is a boolean function that returns True if the time represented by hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.
def func_2():
    x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        
        mm -= x
        
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: snooze_count is the number of iterations the loop executed, mm is (60 * snooze_count) - x, and hh is adjusted to be within the range [0, 23] based on the value of mm.
    print(snooze_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` simulates a countdown timer that starts from the given time `hh:mm` and decrements the minutes by `x` until the time contains the digit '7' according to the function `func_1`. It keeps track of the number of times the timer decrements (`snooze_count`). If the minutes go below zero, it wraps around to the next hour. After the loop ends, it prints the number of times the timer was decremented.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button. It checks if the current time (hh:mm) is lucky using the `func_1` helper function. If not, it continuously decreases the minutes by `x` and adjusts the hours and minutes as needed to account for the 24-hour clock format. The loop continues until a lucky time is found, and the count of snooze presses is returned. This approach ensures that the smallest number of snooze presses is determined for any valid input, satisfying the problem description.
