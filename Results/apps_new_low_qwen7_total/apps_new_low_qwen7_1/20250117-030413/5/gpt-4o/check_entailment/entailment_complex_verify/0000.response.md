### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Function Definitions:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time (a time containing the digit '7') starting from a given time `(hh:mm)` and a given snooze interval `x`.
   - `func_1(h, m)` checks if the time `h:m` contains the digit '7'.
   - `func_2()` reads input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`, and uses `func_1()` to determine the number of snooze presses needed.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1(h, m)`):**
     - The function correctly checks if either the hour or the minute contains the digit '7'.
     - No issues identified here.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2()`):**
     - Reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
     - Uses a `while` loop to decrement the minutes by `x` until a lucky time is found.
     - Adjusts the hours and minutes correctly for the 24-hour clock format.
     - The loop terminates when `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`.

3. **Key Points to Validate:**
   - The logic for decrementing minutes and adjusting hours/minutes is correct.
   - The loop condition (`not func_1(hh, mm)`) is correctly checking for the condition to break the loop.
   - The function handles the 24-hour clock correctly by wrapping around when hours go below 0.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly used to check for the presence of the digit '7'.

4. **Original Assessment Verification:**
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of snooze presses.
   - The provided code accurately simulates the countdown to a lucky time and correctly counts the number of presses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of snooze presses needed to reach a lucky time.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
