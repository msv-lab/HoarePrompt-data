### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if either the hour (`h`) or minute (`m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - This is correctly implemented using the string method `in` to check for the presence of '7' in the string representation of `h` and `m`.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time (`hh:mm`) is lucky (contains '7') using `func_1`.
     - If the time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by one.
     - If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the previous day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.
   - Once the loop exits, it prints the snooze count, indicating the minimum number of times the snooze button was pressed.

   - The logic correctly handles the wrap-around of hours and minutes, ensuring that the time remains within valid ranges (00:00 to 23:59).
   - The function ensures that it finds a lucky time since it's guaranteed that such a time exists.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided logic correctly handles edge cases like wrap-around times and ensures that the loop terminates once a lucky time is found.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` checks for the presence of '7' in both the hour and minute, which is accurate.
- The main logic in `func_2` is correctly described and explained.
- The handling of edge cases such as time wrap-around and ensuring the existence of a lucky time is also correctly addressed.

However, there is a minor issue with the annotation regarding the state of the program after the loop execution:

- The annotation states that `mm` is `(60 * snooze_count) - x`, which is not entirely accurate. Instead, `mm` should be adjusted to reflect the actual minutes remaining after the loop has executed multiple times. Specifically, `mm` is the result of continuously subtracting `x` from the initial `mm` until a lucky time is found.

### Final Evaluation:

The program is fundamentally correct, and the logic works as intended. The minor inaccuracy in the annotation does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Final: **True**
