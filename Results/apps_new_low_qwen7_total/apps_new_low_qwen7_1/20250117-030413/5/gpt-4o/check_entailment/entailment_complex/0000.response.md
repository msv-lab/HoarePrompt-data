Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function correctly checks if a given time (hour and minute) contains the digit '7'. It works for any valid time within the constraints.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to 0, which will count the number of times the alarm is snoozed.
   - It enters a loop that continues until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7' as determined by `func_1`.
     - In each iteration, it decreases the minutes (`mm`) by `x`.
     - If `mm` goes below zero, it adjusts `mm` to `mm + 60` and decreases `hh` by 1.
     - If `hh` goes below zero, it adjusts `hh` to `hh + 24` to ensure the time stays within the valid 24-hour format.
   - Once the loop exits, it prints the value of `snooze_count`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function correctly handles the wrapping of minutes and hours.
   - The loop ensures that the time eventually reaches a lucky time, given the problem guarantees one exists.
   - The logic for adjusting minutes and hours is sound and follows the rules of a 24-hour clock.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes it within the constraints provided.

Given the analysis, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement. All functions work together to provide the correct solution.

Correctness: **True**
