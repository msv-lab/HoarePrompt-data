Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button. It checks if the current time (hh:mm) is lucky using the `func_1` helper function. If not, it continuously decreases the minutes by `x` and adjusts the hours and minutes as needed to account for the 24-hour clock format. The loop continues until a lucky time is found, and the count of snooze presses is returned. This approach ensures that the smallest number of snooze presses is determined for any valid input, satisfying the problem description.
