You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    x = int(input())
    (hh, mm) = map(int, input().split())
    snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        mm -= x
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
    print(snooze_count)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` simulates a countdown timer that starts from the given time `hh:mm` and decrements the minutes by `x` until the time contains the digit '7' according to the function `func_1`. It keeps track of the number of times the timer decrements (`snooze_count`). If the minutes go below zero, it wraps around to the next hour. After the loop ends, it prints the number of times the timer was decremented.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if either the hour (`h`) or minute (`m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - This is correctly implemented using the string method `in` to check for the presence of '7' in the string representation of `h` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time (`hh:mm`) is lucky (contains '7') using `func_1`.
     - If the time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by one.
     - If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the previous day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.
   - Once the loop exits, it prints the snooze count, indicating the minimum number of times the snooze button was pressed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the wrap-around of hours and minutes, ensuring that the time remains within valid ranges (00:00 to 23:59).
   - The function ensures that it finds a lucky time since it's guaranteed that such a time exists.

Given the above points, the provided Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
