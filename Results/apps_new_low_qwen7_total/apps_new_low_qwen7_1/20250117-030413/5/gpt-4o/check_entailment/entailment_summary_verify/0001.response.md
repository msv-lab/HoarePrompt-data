### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if either the hour (`h`) or minute (`m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - The implementation using `str(h)` and `str(m)` and checking if `'7' in str(h)` or `'7' in str(m)` is accurate.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
   - The loop decrements `mm` by `x` minutes each iteration until the time contains the digit '7'.
   - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by one.
   - If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the previous day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.

   **Key Points to Evaluate:**
   - The logic for wrapping around hours and minutes is correct.
   - The loop will eventually terminate because the problem guarantees that there is a lucky time.
   - The decrement by `x` minutes and the wrap-around logic ensure that the time will cycle through all valid times until a lucky time is found.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the wrap-around correctly, ensuring that the time remains within valid ranges (00:00 to 23:59).
   - The function ensures that it finds a lucky time since it's guaranteed that such a time exists.

Given the above points, the provided Python program accurately follows the problem description and correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of snoozes needed to reach a lucky time.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to wake up at a lucky time.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
