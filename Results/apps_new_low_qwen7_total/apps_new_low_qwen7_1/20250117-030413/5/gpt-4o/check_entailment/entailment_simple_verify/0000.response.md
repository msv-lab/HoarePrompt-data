### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the given problem description and annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if a given time contains the digit '7'. The function works as expected:
- Converts the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) into strings.
- Checks if either string contains the character '7'.
- Returns `True` if any of the conditions are met; otherwise, returns `False`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function takes the input values `x`, `hh`, and `mm` and determines the minimum number of snooze button presses required to reach a lucky time.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `x`: An integer between 1 and 60.
   - `(hh, mm)`: A pair of integers representing the target time in 24-hour format.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `snooze_count` is initialized to 0.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `snooze_count` is incremented by 1.
     - `mm` is decremented by `x`.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it is adjusted by adding 60 to bring it back within the valid range.
     - If adjusting `mm` causes `hh` to become negative, it is adjusted by adding 24 to bring it back within the valid range.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, meaning a lucky time is found.
   - The function prints the value of `snooze_count`, which represents the minimum number of snooze button presses required.

#### Annotations and Validation:
- **State Before `func_1(h, m)` Call**: 
  - `h` and `m` are integers representing hours and minutes, with valid ranges.
  - The function correctly checks if the time contains '7'.
  
- **State Before `func_2` Call**: 
  - `x` is an integer between 1 and 60.
  - `hh` and `mm` are integers representing the target time, with valid ranges.
  - The loop runs as expected, decrementing `mm` by `x` each iteration, and adjusting `hh` and `mm` as necessary.

The provided code accurately follows the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the nearest future lucky time and calculates the minimum number of snooze button presses required to reach it.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of snooze button presses required to reach a lucky time.
