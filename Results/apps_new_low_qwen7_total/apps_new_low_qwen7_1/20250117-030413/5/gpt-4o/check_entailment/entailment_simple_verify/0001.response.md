### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if either the hour (`h`) or minute (`m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - This is implemented correctly using the string method `in` to check for the presence of '7' in the string representation of `h` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time (`hh:mm`) is lucky (contains '7') using `func_1`.
     - If the time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by one.
     - If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the previous day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.
   - Once the loop exits, it prints the snooze count, indicating the minimum number of times the snooze button was pressed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the wrap-around of hours and minutes, ensuring that the time remains within valid ranges (00:00 to 23:59).
   - The function ensures that it finds a lucky time since it's guaranteed that such a time exists.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

- The program starts with reading `x`, `hh`, and `mm` from the input.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies if a given time is lucky.
- The main loop in `func_2` correctly simulates pressing the snooze button until a lucky time is reached.
- The logic for adjusting `hh` and `mm` during the loop correctly handles all edge cases, including crossing into the next day and wrapping around to the previous hour.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `x` is read as an integer.
   - `hh` and `mm` are read as integers from the input.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues until a lucky time is found (i.e., `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`).
   - In each iteration:
     - `snooze_count` is incremented.
     - `mm` is decremented by `x`.
     - If `mm` goes below zero, `mm` is adjusted by adding 60 and `hh` is decremented by one.
     - If `hh` goes below zero, `hh` is adjusted by adding 24.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The logic correctly handles the transition between days and hours.
   - The condition to break out of the loop (`func_1(hh, mm)`) ensures that the program stops as soon as a lucky time is reached.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected, and the loop terminates only when a lucky time is found.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
