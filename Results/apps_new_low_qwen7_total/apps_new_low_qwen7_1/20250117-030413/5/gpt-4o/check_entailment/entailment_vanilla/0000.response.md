### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if either the hour (`h`) or minute (`m`) contains the digit '7'.
   - This is correctly implemented using the string method `in` to check for the presence of '7' in the string representation of `h` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time (`hh:mm`) is lucky (contains '7') using `func_1`.
     - If the time is not lucky, it increments the snooze count and decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
     - If `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to the next hour by adding 60 minutes to `mm` and decrementing `hh` by one.
     - If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to the previous day by adding 24 hours to `hh`.
   - Once the loop exits, it prints the snooze count, indicating the minimum number of times the snooze button was pressed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the wrap-around of hours and minutes, ensuring that the time remains within valid ranges (00:00 to 23:59).
   - The function ensures that it finds a lucky time since it's guaranteed that such a time exists.

Given the above points, the provided Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
