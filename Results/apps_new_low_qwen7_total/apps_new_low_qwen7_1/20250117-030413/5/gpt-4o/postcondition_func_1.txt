The function `func_2` simulates a countdown timer that starts from the given time `hh:mm` and decrements the minutes by `x` until the time contains the digit '7' according to the function `func_1`. It keeps track of the number of times the timer decrements (`snooze_count`). If the minutes go below zero, it wraps around to the next hour. After the loop ends, it prints the number of times the timer was decremented.
