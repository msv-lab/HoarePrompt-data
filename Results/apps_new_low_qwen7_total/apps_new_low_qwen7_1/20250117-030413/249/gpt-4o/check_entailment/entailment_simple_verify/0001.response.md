### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to calculate the number of ways in which Memory's final score can be strictly greater than Lexa's final score after `t` turns, where each turn involves adding an integer from the range `[-k, k]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: 
   - The code uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each possible score difference between Memory and Lexa.
   - It uses two arrays, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`, to store the counts of ways to achieve each score difference up to `2k*t` (since the maximum possible score difference is `2kt`).

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each turn, the code updates the `dp_curr` array based on the previous `dp_prev` values.
   - The `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the range sum needed to update `dp_curr`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all turns, the result is computed by summing the counts in `dp_prev` where Memory’s score is strictly greater than Lexa’s score (`max_diff + 1` to `2*max_diff`).

5. **Modulo Operation**: 
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized to zeros and `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is set to 1. This correctly initializes the starting point for the DP arrays.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The `prefix_sum` array is used to compute cumulative sums efficiently. This helps in calculating the range sum for updating `dp_curr`.

- **DP Transition**:
  - The transition logic in the nested loop correctly updates `dp_curr` based on the prefix sums. The sliding window technique ensures that the range of possible score differences is considered efficiently.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The final result is correctly calculated by summing the relevant elements in `dp_prev`. The modulo operation is applied correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution appears to be correct according to the problem description. The approach correctly models the problem using dynamic programming, and the implementation details are sound. The use of prefix sums and the modulo operation are appropriate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program logic aligns with the requirements of the problem, and the implementation details are sound.
