Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to count the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa after \( t \) turns. Each player can gain or lose an integer between \([-k, k]\) each turn.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways Memory can end up with a higher score than Lexa. The state `dp_prev[i]` represents the number of ways to have a difference of `i` between Memory's and Lexa's scores after all turns.
3. **Initialization and Transition**: 
   - The initial difference between Memory and Lexa is `a - b`.
   - For each turn, we update the DP array based on the possible score changes (\([-2k, 2k]\)).
4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array (`prefix_sum`) is used to efficiently compute the number of ways to reach a certain score difference.
5. **Result Calculation**: The result is computed by summing the number of ways where Memory's score is greater than Lexa's score (i.e., differences from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`).

The provided code correctly implements the above logic, ensuring that the dynamic programming table is updated properly and the result is calculated accurately using modular arithmetic.

Based on the explanation and the provided execution summary, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
