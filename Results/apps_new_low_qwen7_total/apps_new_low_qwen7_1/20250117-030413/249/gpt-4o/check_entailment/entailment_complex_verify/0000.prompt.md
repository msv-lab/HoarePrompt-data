You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Memory and his friend Lexa are competing to get higher score in one popular computer game. Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [ - k;k] (i.e. one integer among  - k,  - k + 1,  - k + 2, ...,  - 2,  - 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.

Memory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k + 1)^2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Please solve this problem for Memory.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7) in one line.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 2 1

Output
6

Input
1 1 1 2

Output
31

Input
2 12 3 1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2. If Lexa picks  - 2, Memory can pick 0, 1, or 2 to win. If Lexa picks  - 1, Memory can pick 1 or 2 to win. If Lexa picks 0, Memory can pick 2 to win. If Lexa picks 1 or 2, Memory cannot win. Thus, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games in which Memory wins.

    #
    #### Analysis and Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Initial State**:
    #   - `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
    #   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000.
    #   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
    #   - `max_diff` is set to 2 * k * t.
    #   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1, both initially filled with zeros.
    #   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is 1.
    #
    #2. **Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
    #   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum` is reset to a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3, all set to zero.
    #   - A prefix sum array is built up from the `dp_prev` array.
    #   - For each position `i` in `dp_curr`, the value is computed using the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique.
    #
    #3. **Invariants**:
    #   - The value of `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
    #   - The structure of the loops and computations ensures that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap roles after each iteration but maintain the same values within their respective roles.
    #
    #4. **Final Output State**:
    #   - After `t` iterations, both `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will contain the same values because they continuously swap roles while maintaining the same state due to the nature of the loop and the way the `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` lists are updated.
    #   - The `prefix_sum` array is rebuilt from scratch in each iteration, but its structure remains consistent with the cumulative sums of the `dp_prev` array.
    #   - All `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` elements are calculated based on the prefix sum values, ensuring consistency across iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The output state after the loop has executed `t` times is that `t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, and `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD.
    result = 0
    for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
        result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `result` is updated as (result + dp_prev[i]) \% MOD.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. It computes a specific value based on these parameters and prints the result. Here’s the detailed summary of the function's final state after execution:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is greater than `b` and `t` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `t` is 1, both players will get a random integer in the range `[-k, k]`, and we need to calculate the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

Let's consider the case `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `k = 2`, and `t = 1`. In this case, Memory starts with 2 and Lexa starts with 1. For Memory to win, he needs to get a higher score than Lexa after one turn. Possible outcomes for each player are:

- Memory: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
- Lexa: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

For Memory to win, the following scenarios must occur:
- Memory gets 0 and Lexa gets -1, -2
- Memory gets 1 and Lexa gets -2
- Memory gets 2 and Lexa gets -2, -1, 0

This gives us 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 possible games where Memory wins. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 6.

The issue lies in the logic of the program where it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa. The program does not correctly account for all possible outcomes when `t` is 1.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
