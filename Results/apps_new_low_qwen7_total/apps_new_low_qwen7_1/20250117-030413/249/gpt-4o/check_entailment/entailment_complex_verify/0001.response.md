### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the number of ways Memory's final score can be strictly greater than Lexa's final score after `t` turns, where each turn involves adding an integer from the range `[-k, k]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: 
   - The code uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each possible score difference between Memory and Lexa.
   - It uses two arrays, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`, to store the counts of ways to achieve each score difference up to `2kt` (since the maximum possible score difference is `2kt`).

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each turn, the code updates the `dp_curr` array based on the previous `dp_prev` values.
   - The `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the range sum needed to update `dp_curr`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all turns, the result is computed by summing the counts in `dp_prev` where Memory’s score is strictly greater than Lexa’s score (`max_diff + 1` to `2*max_diff`).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**:
  - `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` are initialized correctly.
  - `max_diff` is set to \(2kt\).
  - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized to all zeros.
  - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is set to 1, indicating the initial state.

- **Loop Behavior**:
  - The outer loop runs `t` times.
  - Inside the loop, `prefix_sum` is reset to zeros for each iteration.
  - The prefix sum array is built up from the `dp_prev` array.
  - For each position `i` in `dp_curr`, the value is computed using the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique.
  - After each iteration, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap roles, ensuring that the state transitions correctly.

- **Final Output State**:
  - After `t` iterations, the `dp_prev` array contains the counts of ways to achieve each score difference where Memory’s score is strictly greater than Lexa’s score.
  - The result is computed by summing the relevant elements in `dp_prev` and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state transitions and the correctness of the approach. The dynamic programming setup and the use of prefix sums ensure that the solution efficiently computes the required number of games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa.
