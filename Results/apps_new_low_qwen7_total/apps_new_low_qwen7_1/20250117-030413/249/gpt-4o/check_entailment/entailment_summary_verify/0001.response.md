### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

#### 1. Problem Understanding:
- We need to count the number of ways Memory can have a strictly higher score than Lexa after `t` turns.
- Each turn, both Memory and Lexa can add any integer from the range `[-k, k]` to their scores.
- The game has `t` turns, so the total number of possible outcomes is \((2k + 1)^{2t}\).
- The result must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach:
- The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference between Memory and Lexa.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays are used to store these counts for the current and next states, respectively.
- The transition between states is done efficiently using prefix sums.

#### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Code:
- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  max_diff = 2 * k * t
  dp_prev = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
  dp_curr = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
  dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1
  ```
  - Initializes `dp_prev` with zeros and sets the starting state for the difference `(a - b)` to `1`.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  ```python
  prefix_sum = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)
  for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
      prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
  ```
  - Computes the prefix sums to efficiently calculate the range sums in the next step.

- **DP Transition**:
  ```python
  for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
      left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
      right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
      dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
  ```
  - Updates `dp_curr` by summing the relevant ranges in `dp_prev` using the prefix sums.
  - This ensures that the new state `dp_curr` reflects the number of ways to achieve each score difference after the current turn.

- **State Update**:
  ```python
  (dp_prev, dp_curr) = (dp_curr, dp_prev)
  ```
  - Swaps `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` to prepare for the next turn.

- **Result Calculation**:
  ```python
  result = 0
  for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
      result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
  print(result)
  ```
  - Sums the counts in `dp_prev` where Memory's score is strictly greater than Lexa's score (`max_diff + 1` to `2*max_diff`).

#### 4. Validation Against Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the function's behavior:
  - Accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`.
  - Computes the number of ways to achieve a strict score advantage for Memory.
  - Prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### 5. Conclusion:
- The provided solution correctly implements the dynamic programming approach.
- The use of prefix sums ensures efficient computation of the required range sums.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly at the end.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
