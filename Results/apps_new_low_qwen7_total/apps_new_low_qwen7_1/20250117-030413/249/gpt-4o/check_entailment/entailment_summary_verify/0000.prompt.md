You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Memory and his friend Lexa are competing to get higher score in one popular computer game. Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [ - k;k] (i.e. one integer among  - k,  - k + 1,  - k + 2, ...,  - 2,  - 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.

Memory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k + 1)^2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Please solve this problem for Memory.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7) in one line.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 2 1

Output
6

Input
1 1 1 2

Output
31

Input
2 12 3 1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2. If Lexa picks  - 2, Memory can pick 0, 1, or 2 to win. If Lexa picks  - 1, Memory can pick 1 or 2 to win. If Lexa picks 0, Memory can pick 2 to win. If Lexa picks 1 or 2, Memory cannot win. Thus, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games in which Memory wins.

- Program:
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
(a, b, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(a, b, k, t)

def func_1(a, b, k, t):
    max_diff = 2 * k * t
    dp_prev = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
    dp_curr = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)
    dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        prefix_sum = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)
        for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
        for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
            left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
            right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
            dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
        (dp_prev, dp_curr) = (dp_curr, dp_prev)
    result = 0
    for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):
        result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. It computes a specific value based on these parameters and prints the result. Here’s the detailed summary of the function's final state after execution:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is greater than `b` and `t` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `t` is 1, both players will get a random integer in the range `[-k, k]`, and we need to calculate the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

Let's consider the case `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `k = 2`, and `t = 1`. In this case, Memory starts with 2 and Lexa starts with 1. For Memory to win, he needs to get a higher score than Lexa after one turn. Possible outcomes for each player are:

- Memory: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
- Lexa: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

For Memory to win, the following scenarios must occur:
- Memory gets 0 and Lexa gets -1, -2
- Memory gets 1 and Lexa gets -2
- Memory gets 2 and Lexa gets -2, -1, 0

This gives us 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 possible games where Memory wins. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 6.

The issue lies in the logic of the program where it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa. The program does not correctly account for all possible outcomes when `t` is 1.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
