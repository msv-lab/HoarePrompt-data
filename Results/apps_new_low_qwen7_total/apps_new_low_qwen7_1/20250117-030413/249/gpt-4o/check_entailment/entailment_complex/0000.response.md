Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes the variables and sets up the dynamic programming approach. The `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays are initialized to store the number of ways to achieve a particular score difference after a certain number of turns.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to reach each possible score difference after each turn. The key part of this transition is the use of prefix sums and sliding windows to efficiently calculate the number of valid moves for each player.

3. **Correct Calculation of `dp_curr`**: The program correctly updates `dp_curr` using the prefix sum array. For each position `i`, it calculates the number of ways to reach that score difference considering the range of possible score changes (`[-2k, 2k]`). This ensures that the transitions between states are handled correctly.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the main loop, the program correctly sums up the number of ways for Memory to have a strictly higher score than Lexa. This is done by iterating over the relevant score differences and summing up the corresponding values in `dp_prev`.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program consistently applies the modulo operation (`% MOD`) to ensure that the result does not overflow and remains within the required bounds.

6. **Input Handling**: The program handles the input correctly and passes it to the function without any issues.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement. The logic and transitions are sound, and the final result is calculated correctly.

Correctness: **True**
