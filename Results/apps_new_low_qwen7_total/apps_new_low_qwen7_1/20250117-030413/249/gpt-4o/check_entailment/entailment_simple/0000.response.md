### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Variables**:
   - The program correctly initializes the variables `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` from the input.
   - It sets `max_diff` to \(2 \cdot k \cdot t\), which represents the maximum possible difference between the final scores of Memory and Lexa.
   - It initializes two arrays `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` to keep track of the number of ways to achieve certain score differences over the turns.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to achieve a specific score difference.
   - It iterates through the turns (`t` times) and updates the `dp` arrays using a sliding window technique to account for the possible score changes per turn.
   - The `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the number of ways to achieve a certain score difference using cumulative sums.

3. **Boundary Conditions and Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions by setting the range for the score differences (`-max_diff` to `max_diff`).
   - It applies the modulo operation `% MOD` to ensure the result does not overflow and stays within the required constraints.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After completing the dynamic programming steps, the program calculates the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa.
   - It iterates through the possible positive score differences and sums up the corresponding values in the `dp_prev` array.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed, which is the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The program follows the necessary steps to compute the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Given the correct initialization, dynamic programming approach, and handling of boundaries, the program should produce the correct output.

**Correctness: **True**
