Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `a` is greater than `b` and `t` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `t` is 1, both players will get a random integer in the range `[-k, k]`, and we need to calculate the number of possible games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

Let's consider the case `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `k = 2`, and `t = 1`. In this case, Memory starts with 2 and Lexa starts with 1. For Memory to win, he needs to get a higher score than Lexa after one turn. Possible outcomes for each player are:

- Memory: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
- Lexa: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

For Memory to win, the following scenarios must occur:
- Memory gets 0 and Lexa gets -1, -2
- Memory gets 1 and Lexa gets -2
- Memory gets 2 and Lexa gets -2, -1, 0

This gives us 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 possible games where Memory wins. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 6.

The issue lies in the logic of the program where it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa. The program does not correctly account for all possible outcomes when `t` is 1.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
