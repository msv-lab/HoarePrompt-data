`result` is assigned the value of `result + dp_prev[i]` modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, `dp_prev[i]` is \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\). Since `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `left` is 0, and `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
dp_prev[i] = (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}
\]

Therefore, `result` becomes:

\[
result = (result + (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0])) \% \text{MOD}
\]

The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the updated states are:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros.
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).
- `result` is updated as above.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros; `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\); `left` is 0; `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\); `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\); `result` is updated as (result + (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0])) \% \text{MOD}.**
