Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies `i` as the variable that ranges from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`
   - `i` is 1
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (if the loop were to continue).
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to 2.

5. **Other variables**: No other variables are mentioned in the loop head or directly affected by the loop's continuation criteria.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`, `i` is 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
