Output State: **dp_prev is the previous state of dp_curr before the swap, dp_curr is updated with the new values, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 with all elements initialized to 0 except for the elements from prefix_sum[1] to prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2], which contain the cumulative sums of dp_prev modulo MOD, i is 2 * max_diff + 1, left is calculated as max(0, i - 2 * k), right is calculated as min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr[i] is updated to (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `dp_curr[i]` based on the range defined by `left` and `right`.
- `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`, which ensures that `left` is at least 0.
- `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`, which ensures that `right` does not exceed `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `dp_curr[i]` is then updated to the value of `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`, which effectively uses the cumulative sums stored in `prefix_sum` to compute the desired value for `dp_curr[i]`.

Since `i` is set to `2 * max_diff + 1`, the calculation for `dp_curr[i]` will use the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, reflecting the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.
