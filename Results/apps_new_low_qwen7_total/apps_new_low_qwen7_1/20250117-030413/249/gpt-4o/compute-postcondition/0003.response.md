Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range` function.
   - The variables `max_diff` and `2 * max_diff + 1` are constants or variables that determine the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop:**
   - We know that `t` is greater than 0, but this does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - Therefore, the first iteration of the loop requires `i` to be 0.

4. **State required for the loop to execute the first time:**
   - `i` must be 0.
   - The value of `max_diff` is fixed but unknown, so we don't need to adjust its state.
   - The `prefix_sum` list remains unchanged and still has a length of `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

Based on this analysis, the state needed for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros**
