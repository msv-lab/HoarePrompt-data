### Initial State
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
- `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
    right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
    dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

### Loop Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`. For each iteration, it calculates `left` and `right` based on the current index `i` and the value of `k`. Then, it updates `dp_curr[i]` using the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
2. **Invariants**:
   - `t` remains constant and does not change during the loop.
   - `k` is a constant and does not change during the loop.
   - `prefix_sum` is initially a list of zeros.
3. **Final Values**:
   - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged because it is only used for calculating `dp_curr` and is not modified inside the loop.
   - `dp_curr` is updated for each `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff` using the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

### Verifying the Output States
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `i = 0`: `left = max(0, 0 - 2 * k) = 0`, `right = min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1 = 1`, `dp_curr[0] = (prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD = 0`.
  - All other elements in `dp_curr` are 0.
- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `i = 1`: `left = max(0, 1 - 2 * k)`, `right = min(2 * max_diff, 1 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_curr[1] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
  - `i = 2`: `left = max(0, 2 - 2 * k)`, `right = min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_curr[2] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
  - All other elements in `dp_curr` are 0.
- **General Case**:
  - For each `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff`, `dp_curr[i]` is updated based on the current `left` and `right` values.
  - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged as it is only used for reading values, not writing.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes, `prefix_sum` remains a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, and `dp_curr` is updated for each `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff` using the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes is:
Output State: **t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 2 * max_diff + 1, left is max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD.**
