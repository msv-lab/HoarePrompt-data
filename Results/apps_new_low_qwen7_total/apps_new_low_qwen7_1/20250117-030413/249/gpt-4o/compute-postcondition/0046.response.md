Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `dp_curr` is updated with new values.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
   - `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - `dp_curr[i]` is updated to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range `[0, 2 * max_diff]`.
   - Currently, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, which is outside the range `[0, 2 * max_diff]`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `i` exceeds the upper limit of the loop.

Since the loop will not execute again due to the current value of `i`, no adjustments are needed for the states inside the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is updated with new values, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`, `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_curr[i]` is updated to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`**
