The code initializes a list `prefix_sum` with zeros, having a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`. The values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0**
