The code snippet provided is `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. However, there are no definitions for `prefix_sum`, `i`, `dp_prev`, and `MOD` in the initial state. We know from the initial state that `i` is now 4 and `t` remains greater than 0. Since `prefix_sum` remains unchanged and no modifications are made to it within the loop, the value of `prefix_sum` does not change.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is now 4.
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged.

Since the code updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` and `i` is currently 4, this means `prefix_sum[5]` is being updated. However, since no specific values for `prefix_sum[4]` and `dp_prev[4]` are provided, and the operation is performed under the condition that `prefix_sum` remains unchanged, we cannot determine the exact value of `prefix_sum[5]`.

The output state will reflect the unchanged conditions and the new assignment that would occur if `prefix_sum` were to be modified, but since it is not, the state remains as specified.

Output State: **`t` remains greater than 0, `i` is now 4, `prefix_sum` remains unchanged**
