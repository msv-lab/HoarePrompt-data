Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros
- `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`
- `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`
- `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`
- `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`
- `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap
- `prefix_sum` is now `[0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)`

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable Invariance**:
   - The variable `t` remains 0 as it is not used in the loop.
   - `left` and `right` are defined outside the loop and do not change inside the loop.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are also defined outside the loop and remain unchanged within the loop unless explicitly reassigned.
   - `i` increments from `2 * max_diff + 1` to `0` due to the loop range, but this doesn't affect the state because the loop starts with `i = 2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 2 * max_diff + 1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated using the value of `dp_prev[i]`.

### Tracking `prefix_sum`:
- Initially, `prefix_sum` is `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (2 * max_diff + 3 elements).

#### Iteration Analysis:
- When `i = 2 * max_diff + 1`:
  ```python
  prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] = (prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]) % MOD
  ```
  Since `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1]` is initially 0:
  ```python
  prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] = dp_prev[2 * max_diff + 1]
  ```

- When `i = 2 * max_diff`:
  ```python
  prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] = (prefix_sum[2 * max_diff] + dp_prev[2 * max_diff]) % MOD
  ```

- This process continues until `i = 0`:
  ```python
  prefix_sum[1] = (prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD
  ```

Since `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0:
  ```python
  prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0]
  ```

By the end of the loop, `prefix_sum` will have the following values:
- `prefix_sum[0] = 0`
- `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0]`
- `prefix_sum[2] = dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1]`
- ...
- `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] = sum(dp_prev) % MOD`

### Output State After All Iterations:
- `i` will be 0 after the loop.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`prefix_sum` is `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`, `i` is 0.**
