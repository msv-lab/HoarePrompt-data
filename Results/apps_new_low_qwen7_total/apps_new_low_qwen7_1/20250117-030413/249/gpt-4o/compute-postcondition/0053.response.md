The given code snippet is:
```python
result = 0
```

This line initializes the variable `result` to 0. It does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD, and `result` is 0.**
