Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `2 * max_diff`. The loop updates the `prefix_sum` list such that each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]` modulo `MOD`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`**: These are not updated within the loop, so they remain the same as their initial values.
- **`prefix_sum`**: This list is updated according to the loop. Initially, all elements are `0`.
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, starting from `0`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop updates the `prefix_sum` array in a cumulative manner. Specifically, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is computed as follows:
\[ \text{prefix\_sum}[i + 1] = (\text{prefix\_sum}[i] + \text{dp\_prev}[i]) \mod \text{MOD} \]

After `k` iterations, the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will be:
\[ \text{prefix\_sum}[i + 1] = \sum_{j=0}^{i} \text{dp\_prev}[j] \mod \text{MOD} \]

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Based on the provided outputs, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`
- After 2 iterations, `prefix_sum[2] = (dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1]) % MOD`
- After 3 iterations, `prefix_sum[3] = (dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`

This pattern continues up to `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations.

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed all `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations, the `prefix_sum` list will contain the cumulative sums of the `dp_prev` array up to each index. The final state of the `prefix_sum` list will be:
\[ \text{prefix\_sum}[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \text{dp\_prev}[j] \mod \text{MOD} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, 2 * \text{max\_diff} + 2 \]

All other variables (`dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

### Conclusion
Output State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, and `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.**
