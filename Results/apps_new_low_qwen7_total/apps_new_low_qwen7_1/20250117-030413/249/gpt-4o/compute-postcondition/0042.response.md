The code updates the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` to `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. So, `i + 1` is 3. We need to update `prefix_sum[3]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `prefix_sum[3]` is `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`.

After running the code snippet, `prefix_sum[3]` will be updated to:
\[ \text{new\_prefix\_sum}[3] = (\text{prefix\_sum}[2] + \text{dp\_prev}[2]) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since the initial value of `prefix_sum[3]` is `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`, and the code does not change this relationship, the new value of `prefix_sum[3]` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 2, `prefix_sum[3]` is `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`**.
