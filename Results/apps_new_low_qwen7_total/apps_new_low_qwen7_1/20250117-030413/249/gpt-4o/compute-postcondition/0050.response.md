Output State: **dp_prev is the previous state of dp_curr before the swap, dp_curr contains the updated values after the last iteration, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from prefix_sum[1] to prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] which contain the cumulative sums of dp_curr modulo MOD, i is 2 * max_diff + 1, left is 0, right is 2 * max_diff + 1, dp_curr[i] is ((prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD).**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `left` and `right` based on `i` and `k`.
   - It updates `dp_curr[i]` using the difference between `prefix_sum[right]` and `prefix_sum[left]` modulo `MOD`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `dp_prev` remains unchanged after the first swap and is used as the reference for updating `dp_curr`.
   - `prefix_sum` is updated incrementally during each iteration but is reset to zero for all indices except `[1, 2 * max_diff + 2]` initially.
   - `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 1` and does not change within the loop.
   - `left` and `right` are recalculated in each iteration but their final value after the loop completes is `0` and `2 * max_diff + 1` respectively.
   - `dp_curr` is updated in each iteration.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After each iteration, `dp_curr` gets updated based on the cumulative sums stored in `prefix_sum`.
   - The final value of `dp_curr` after the loop will reflect the cumulative effects of all updates.
   - `prefix_sum` will contain cumulative sums of `dp_curr` modulo `MOD` starting from index `1` to `2 * max_diff + 2`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final state of `dp_curr` is determined by the cumulative sums stored in `prefix_sum` at the end of the loop.
   - `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` will hold the sum of `dp_curr` from index `0` to `2 * max_diff + 1`, and `prefix_sum[0]` will be zero because `prefix_sum` is initialized this way.
   - Therefore, the final value of `dp_curr[2 * max_diff + 1]` will be `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.

Thus, the final state after all iterations is as described above.
