Initial State: `prefix_sum` is `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`, `i` is 0

```
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD

```

Analysis:
1. `left = max(0, i - 2 * k)` calculates the starting index for the prefix sum segment based on the current value of `i` (which is 0) and the value of `k`. If `i - 2 * k` is negative, it sets `left` to 0.
2. `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1` calculates the ending index for the prefix sum segment based on the value of `max_diff` and the current value of `i`. It adds 1 to include the upper bound.
3. `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` calculates the difference between the prefix sums at indices `right` and `left` and stores it in `dp_curr[i]`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `max_diff` are not given, we cannot determine the exact values of `left` and `right`. However, we know that `left` will be 0 because `i` is 0 and thus `i - 2 * k` will be negative for any non-negative `k`. The value of `right` will depend on `max_diff` and `k`.

Let's denote `max_diff` as `md` and `k` as `k_val`. Then:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` will be `min(2 * md, 2 * k_val) + 1`.

Given these conditions, `dp_curr[0]` will be calculated as follows:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is 0.
- `prefix_sum[right]` will be the sum of the elements from `dp_prev[0]` up to `dp_prev[2 * md or 2 * k_val]`.
- `dp_curr[0]` will be `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `prefix_sum[right] % MOD`.

Since the exact values of `prefix_sum` beyond the initial elements are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `prefix_sum[right]`, but we know the form of the expression.

Final Output State: **`prefix_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `dp_curr[0]` is `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`**
