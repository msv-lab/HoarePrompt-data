You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD, and all elements of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are the same after t iterations.

### Analysis and Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `max_diff` is set to 2 * k * t.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1, both initially filled with zeros.
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is 1.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum` is reset to a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3, all set to zero.
   - A prefix sum array is built up from the `dp_prev` array.
   - For each position `i` in `dp_curr`, the value is computed using the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique.

3. **Invariants**:
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The structure of the loops and computations ensures that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap roles after each iteration but maintain the same values within their respective roles.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After `t` iterations, both `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will contain the same values because they continuously swap roles while maintaining the same state due to the nature of the loop and the way the `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` lists are updated.
   - The `prefix_sum` array is rebuilt from scratch in each iteration, but its structure remains consistent with the cumulative sums of the `dp_prev` array.
   - All `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` elements are calculated based on the prefix sum values, ensuring consistency across iterations.

### Conclusion:
The output state after the loop has executed `t` times is that `t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, and `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD.

result = 0

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
