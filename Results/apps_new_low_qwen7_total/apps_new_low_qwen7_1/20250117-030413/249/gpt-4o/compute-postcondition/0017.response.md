The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_curr` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Since `dp_prev` was not explicitly initialized, its initial value is irrelevant for this step, and it simply takes the value of `dp_curr` after the swap.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`, `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap.**
