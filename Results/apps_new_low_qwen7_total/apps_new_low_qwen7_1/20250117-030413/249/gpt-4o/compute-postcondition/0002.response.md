The code initializes a list `prefix_sum` with zeros, where the length of the list is `2 * max_diff + 3`. Since the initial value of `max_diff` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact length of the list. However, we know that `t` must be greater than 0, which is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros**
