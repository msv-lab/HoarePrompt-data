Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros
- `i` is 3
- `left` is \(\max(0, 2 - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 2 + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- `dp_curr` is a list `[0]`

Let's execute the code snippet:

```python
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

First, let's determine the values of `left` and `right` based on the initial conditions. Assuming `k` and `max_diff` are constants or predefined values, we need to calculate `left` and `right`.

1. Calculate `left`:
   \[
   \text{left} = \max(0, i - 2 \times k) = \max(0, 3 - 2 \times k)
   \]

2. Calculate `right`:
   \[
   \text{right} = \min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, i + 2 \times k) + 1 = \min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 3 + 2 \times k) + 1
   \]

Since `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, the expression `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left])` simplifies to zero because both `prefix_sum[right]` and `prefix_sum[left]` are zero.

Therefore, `dp_curr[i]` is set to:
\[
dp_curr[i] = (0 - 0) \% \text{MOD} = 0
\]

After running the code, the state of the variables is updated as follows:
- `t` remains greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged (still a list of zeros)
- `i` remains 3 (unchanged)
- `left` is \(\max(0, 3 - 2 \times k)\)
- `right` is \(\min(2 \times \text{max\_diff}, 3 + 2 \times k) + 1\)
- `dp_curr` is now `[0, 0]` because it is a list and the operation modifies the element at index `i` (which is 3, so it appends another 0).

Output State: **t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 3, left is max(0, 3 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is [0, 0]**
