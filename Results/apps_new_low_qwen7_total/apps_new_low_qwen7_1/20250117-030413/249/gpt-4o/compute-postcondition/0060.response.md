Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `result` is updated as (result + dp_prev[i]) \% MOD.**

### Analysis:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - The loop will run until `i` reaches `2 * max_diff + 1`, which means it will run exactly once.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `t` remains constant and is greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` remains a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros.
   - `left` remains 0.
   - `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\).

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs exactly once, incrementing `i` from `2 * max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff + 2`.
   - Inside the loop, `result` is updated by adding `dp_prev[i]` to `result` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Since `dp_prev[i]` is \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\) for all `i`, the update to `result` can be summarized as:
     \[
     \text{result} = (\text{result} + (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0])) \% \text{MOD}
     \]
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `2 * max_diff + 2`, and `result` will be updated as shown above.

Thus, the final output state is as described.
