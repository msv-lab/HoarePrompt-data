Output State: **t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 1, left is 0, right is 0, dp_curr is a list with one element which is 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line initializes `left` with the value of `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Given that `i` is 0 and assuming `k` is a non-negative integer (since it's not defined in the snippet, we can infer this from context), `left` becomes `max(0, 0 - 2 * k)` which simplifies to `max(0, -2 * k)`. Since `k` is non-negative, `-2 * k` is non-positive, so `left` becomes 0.
2. The second line initializes `right` with the value of `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Again, given `i` is 0 and `k` is a non-negative integer, `right` becomes `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1` which simplifies to `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`. This means `right` will be `2 * k + 1` if `2 * k` is less than or equal to `2 * max_diff`, otherwise it will be `2 * max_diff + 1`.
3. The third line updates `dp_curr[i]` with `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Since both `left` and `right` are initialized to 0, `prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]` is equivalent to `prefix_sum[0] - prefix_sum[0]`, which is 0. Thus, `dp_curr[i]` is set to 0. 

Note: The code snippet assumes that `dp_curr` is a list and `MOD` is defined elsewhere in the code. Also, `i` is incremented to 1 at the end of this code snippet, but since it is not shown in the snippet, we assume it is updated outside of this code block. The provided code snippet only modifies `i`, `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr[i]`. Therefore, the final state includes these updates while keeping the other variables and their initial states.
