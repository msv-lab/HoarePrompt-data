Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States Before the Loop:**
   - `prefix_sum`: A list where each element is calculated based on `dp_prev`.
   - `i`: Initially set to 0.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition.
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, the first iteration occurs when `i` is 0.

4. **Check the Constraints and Initial Values:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `i` does not exceed the upper limit of the range, which is `2 * max_diff`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - At the start of the loop, `i` is 0.
   - The value of `i` (which is 0) must be less than or equal to `2 * max_diff` for the loop to execute the first time.

Given this analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head must satisfy the following conditions for the loop to execute the first time:

State: **`prefix_sum` is `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`, `i` is 0, and `2 * max_diff` must be at least 0**.

Since `max_diff` is a non-negative integer, `2 * max_diff` will always be at least 0. Therefore, the key requirement here is simply that `i` is 0.

Final State: **`prefix_sum` is `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`, `i` is 0**.
