Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
     - `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.
     - `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`.
     - All other elements are 0.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. This means `i` must be from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i`, we need to update `i` to the next value in the range.
   - The current value of `i` is 3. The next value of `i` would be 4 if `2 * max_diff + 1` is greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `prefix_sum` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `prefix_sum` based on the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.**
