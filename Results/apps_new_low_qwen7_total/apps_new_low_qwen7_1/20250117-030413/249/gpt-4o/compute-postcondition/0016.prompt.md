Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's analyze the given Python loop and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Loop Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`. For each iteration, it updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
2. **Invariants**: 
   - The length of `prefix_sum` remains `2 * max_diff + 3`.
   - `t` is a constant and does not change during the loop.
   - `dp_prev` is also a constant and does not change during the loop.
3. **Final Values**: After the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will be updated such that `prefix_sum[i + 1]` contains the cumulative sum of `dp_prev[i]` up to index `i` modulo `MOD`.

### Verifying the Output States
- **After 1 iteration**: `prefix_sum[1] = (prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.
- **After 2 iterations**: `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3] = (prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = (0 + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.
- **After 3 iterations**: `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3] = dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and `prefix_sum[5] = (prefix_sum[4] + dp_prev[4]) % MOD = (0 + dp_prev[4]) % MOD = dp_prev[4] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.

From the pattern, we can generalize that after `n` iterations, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` being odd numbers from `1` to `2 * max_diff + 1` will hold the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` up to those indices modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` times, all the elements in `prefix_sum` will be populated with the cumulative sums as follows:
- `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`
- `prefix_sum[3] = dp_prev[2] % MOD`
- `prefix_sum[5] = dp_prev[4] % MOD`
- ...
- `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] = dp_prev[2 * max_diff] % MOD`

All other elements in `prefix_sum` will remain zero.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes is:
Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`, ..., `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1]` is `dp_prev[2 * max_diff] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
    right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
    dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 1, left is 0, right is 0, dp_curr is a list with one element which is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 2, left is max(0, 2 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list [0]
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 3, left is max(0, 3 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is [0, 0]


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
