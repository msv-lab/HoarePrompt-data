The code snippet updates the `result` variable by adding `dp_prev[i]` and taking the modulo with `MOD`. Let's break down the impact on the variables:

1. **Result Update**: The `result` variable is updated by adding `dp_prev[i]` and taking the modulo with `MOD`. Since `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `dp_prev[i]` corresponds to `dp_prev[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]`.

2. **Other Variables**: None of the other variables (`t`, `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`) are directly affected by this line of code.

Given that `dp_prev` is defined as a list where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), the value of `dp_prev[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `dp_prev[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]`, we can only say that it is part of the list and its value will be added to `result`.

Therefore, the updated `result` will be the original `result` plus the value of `dp_prev[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `result` is updated as (result + dp_prev[i]) \% MOD**
