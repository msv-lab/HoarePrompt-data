Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state of the objects at the start of the loop for the first iteration.

### Initial State
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Loop Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
2. **Initial Condition**: For the loop to start and execute the first iteration, the loop counter `i` must be set to `0`.

### Verifying the Output States
- **Before the First Iteration**: 
  - The loop counter `i` should be `0`.
  - The list `prefix_sum` should have a length of `2 * max_diff + 3` and all elements should be `0`.

### Final Output State for the First Iteration
- **Prefix Sum List**: Since `i` is `0`, the first element of `prefix_sum` that gets updated is `prefix_sum[1]` (because `i + 1` becomes `1`).
  - `prefix_sum[1] = (prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD = (0 + dp_prev[0]) % MOD = dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
- The loop counter `i` must be `0`.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is 0**
