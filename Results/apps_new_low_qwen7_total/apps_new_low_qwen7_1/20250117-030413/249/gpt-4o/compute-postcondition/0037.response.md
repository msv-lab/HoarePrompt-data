Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which ranges from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `dp_prev`: This is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `dp_curr`: This is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `prefix_sum`: This is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

4. **State at the Start of the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0`.
   - Since `i` is initialized to `0` at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is `0` for the first iteration.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - There are no other variables or states that directly influence the loop's execution based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that controls whether the loop will execute the first time is `i`.
- `i` must be `0` for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:

State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0**
