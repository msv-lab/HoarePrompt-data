`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. `prefix_sum` is updated such that `prefix_sum[1]` is set to `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`. Since `prefix_sum` is initialized to a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0. Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` becomes `(0 + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp_prev[0] % MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.**
