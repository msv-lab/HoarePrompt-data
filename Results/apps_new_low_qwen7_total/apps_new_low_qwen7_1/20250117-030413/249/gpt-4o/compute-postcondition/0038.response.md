`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, and `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, the value of `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` is calculated as `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`. Since `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, this simplifies to `prefix_sum[1] = (0 + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`, which further simplifies to `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 0**
