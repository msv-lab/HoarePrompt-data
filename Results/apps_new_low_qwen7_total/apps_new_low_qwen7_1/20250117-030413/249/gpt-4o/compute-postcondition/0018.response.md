Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`.
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
   - `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The loop condition checks if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue.
   - No other variables or lists are modified directly within the loop head itself (i.e., the for loop statement).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State: **`t` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`, `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap**.
