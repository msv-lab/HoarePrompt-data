Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `max_diff`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`. This means that `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff + 1`. Given that `i` is now 1, the loop will continue as long as `1 < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

6. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 1**
