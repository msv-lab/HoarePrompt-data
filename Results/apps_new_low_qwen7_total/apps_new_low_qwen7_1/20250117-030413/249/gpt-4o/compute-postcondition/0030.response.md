Output State: **prefix_sum remains unchanged, i is 3, dp_curr[1] is (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, i - 2 * k)]) % MOD**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `i` as 1 and `dp_curr[0]` as `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.
- The first line calculates `left` as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Given `i` is 1, `left` becomes `max(0, 1 - 2 * k)`.
- The second line calculates `right` as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Given `i` is 1, `right` becomes `min(2 * max_diff, 1 + 2 * k) + 1`.
- The third line updates `dp_curr[i]` to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Given `i` is 1, `dp_curr[1]` becomes `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

Since the exact values of `max_diff` and `k` are not provided, we can express `left` and `right` in terms of these variables. However, the final state includes the updated value of `dp_curr[1]` based on the calculations involving `prefix_sum`, `left`, and `right`.
