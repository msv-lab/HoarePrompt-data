Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`. This means `i` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is \((prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD\)
   - `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\)
   - `i` is 2
   - All other variables remain unchanged

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff`.
   - Therefore, we need to check if `2 < 2 * max_diff`. If this condition holds true, then `i` can be incremented to 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The value of `i` needs to be updated to 3.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` and `prefix_sum[3]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_sum[1]` is \((prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD\)
- `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\)
- All other variables remain unchanged

State: **`i` is 3, `prefix_sum[1]` is \((prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD\), `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\), all other variables remain unchanged**
