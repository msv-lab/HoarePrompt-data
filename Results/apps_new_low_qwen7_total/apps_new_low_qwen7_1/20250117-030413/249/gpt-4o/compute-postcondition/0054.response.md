Let's break down the initial state and determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros.
   - `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).
   - `result` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from \(i = \text{max_diff} + 1\) to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

3. **First Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the initial value of `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition.
   - The initial value of `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - The loop starts at \(\text{max_diff} + 1\) and goes up to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

4. **Verification:**
   - Since `i` is set to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), this value falls within the inclusive range of \(\text{max_diff} + 1\) to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - Therefore, the loop can execute the first time with the given initial values.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - No adjustments are needed for the initial values of `i`, `left`, `right`, or the other variables since they already satisfy the loop condition.
   - However, we should ensure that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are correctly initialized based on the given formula.

Given that all conditions are met, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is to confirm that `i` is correctly set to start the loop, and all other variables are initialized properly.

**State:**
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros.
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\).
- `result` is 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[right] - \text{prefix_sum}[left]) \% \text{MOD}\), and `result` is 0.**
