The code updates the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the previous value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`
- `i` is 2

The code snippet is:

```python
prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

Let's substitute the known values:

- `i + 1` is `2 + 1` which is `3`.
- `prefix_sum[i]` is `prefix_sum[2]`. Since `prefix_sum[2]` is not given, it remains unchanged.
- `dp_prev[i]` is `dp_prev[2]`. Again, since `dp_prev[2]` is not given, it remains unchanged.

So, `prefix_sum[3]` is updated to:

\[ prefix_sum[3] = (prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD \]

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD`, `i` is 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
