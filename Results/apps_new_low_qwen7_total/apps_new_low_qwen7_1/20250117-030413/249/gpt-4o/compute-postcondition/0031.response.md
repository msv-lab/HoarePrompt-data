Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. The only variable involved in this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `0 <= i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`. Therefore, if `i` was 3, the next value of `i` would be 4.

5. **Check if the next value of `i` is within the loop range**: We need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the range `0 <= i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `i` is incremented by 1, we update `i` to 4. The other variables (`prefix_sum`, `dp_curr[1]`, and `max_diff`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`prefix_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is 4, `dp_curr[1]` is (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, i - 2 * k)]) % MOD**
