The code initializes the `prefix_sum` list with zeros of length `2 * max_diff + 3`. This means the previous value of `prefix_sum` is overridden. The other variables (`i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`, `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is now `[0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)`**
