Let's break down the state of the program before the first execution of the for loop and what needs to be true for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`.
   - The loop counter `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `2 * max_diff + 1 <= 2 * max_diff` must hold true.
   - This simplifies to checking if `i` (which starts at `2 * max_diff + 1`) is within the range of `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - The initial value of `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

4. **Range Check:**
   - Since `i` starts at `2 * max_diff + 1`, we need to ensure that this value falls within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff - 1` for the loop to execute.
   - Clearly, `2 * max_diff + 1` is outside this range, so the loop will not execute based on the initial values.

5. **Adjusting Initial State:**
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at `0` instead of `2 * max_diff + 1`.

### Adjusted State:

- Ensure `i` is set to `0` initially.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `left` is `max(0, 2 * max_diff - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`, `dp_curr` is now equal to `dp_prev` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is now `[0] * (2 * max_diff + 3)`**

This ensures that the loop condition `0 <= i < 2 * max_diff + 1` is satisfied for the first iteration.
