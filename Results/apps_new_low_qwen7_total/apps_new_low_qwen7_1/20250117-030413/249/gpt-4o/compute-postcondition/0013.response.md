Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros
- `i` is 2
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 0
- `dp_curr` is a list with one element which is 0

Let's analyze the code block step-by-step:

```python
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

From the code:
1. `left` is set to `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `left` will be `max(0, 2 - 2 * k)`.
2. `right` is set to `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `right` will be `min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1`.
3. `dp_curr[i]` is set to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. This updates the value at index `i` in the `dp_curr` list.

Since the exact value of `k` and `max_diff` is not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `left` and `right`. However, we know:
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
- `i` is 2.
- `dp_curr` is a list with one element which is 0.

Therefore, the expression `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` simplifies to `(0 - 0) % MOD = 0` because both `prefix_sum[left]` and `prefix_sum[right]` are 0.

Thus, `dp_curr[2]` is updated to 0.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 2, left is max(0, 2 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list [0]**
