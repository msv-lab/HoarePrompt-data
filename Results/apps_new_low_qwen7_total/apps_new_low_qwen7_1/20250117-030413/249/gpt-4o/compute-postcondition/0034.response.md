The code `dp_prev, dp_curr = dp_curr, dp_prev` swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Before the swap, `dp_prev` holds the previous state of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` holds the current state of `dp_curr`.

After the swap:
- `dp_prev` will take on the current state of `dp_curr`.
- `dp_curr` will take on the previous state of `dp_curr`, which was stored in `dp_prev`.

Since the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are swapped, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`dp_prev` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, and `dp_curr` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.**
