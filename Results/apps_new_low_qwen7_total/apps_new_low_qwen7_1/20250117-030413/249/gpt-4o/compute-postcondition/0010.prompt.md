You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's analyze the given Python loop and initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Loop Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`. For each iteration, it updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.
2. **Invariants**: 
   - The length of `prefix_sum` remains `2 * max_diff + 3`.
   - `t` is a constant and does not change during the loop.
   - `dp_prev` is also a constant and does not change during the loop.
3. **Final Values**: After the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will be updated such that `prefix_sum[i + 1]` contains the cumulative sum of `dp_prev[i]` up to index `i` modulo `MOD`.

### Verifying the Output States
- **After 1 iteration**: `prefix_sum[1] = (prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.
- **After 2 iterations**: `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3] = (prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = (0 + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.
- **After 3 iterations**: `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3] = dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and `prefix_sum[5] = (prefix_sum[4] + dp_prev[4]) % MOD = (0 + dp_prev[4]) % MOD = dp_prev[4] % MOD`, and all other elements are zero.

From the pattern, we can generalize that after `n` iterations, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` being odd numbers from `1` to `2 * max_diff + 1` will hold the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` up to those indices modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs exactly `2 * max_diff + 1` times, all the elements in `prefix_sum` will be populated with the cumulative sums as follows:
- `prefix_sum[1] = dp_prev[0] % MOD`
- `prefix_sum[3] = dp_prev[2] % MOD`
- `prefix_sum[5] = dp_prev[4] % MOD`
- ...
- `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] = dp_prev[2 * max_diff] % MOD`

All other elements in `prefix_sum` will remain zero.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop finishes is:
Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`, ..., `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1]` is `dp_prev[2 * max_diff] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.
```
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
