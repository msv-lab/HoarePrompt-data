Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `prefix_sum` is defined as `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`.
- `i` is initially set to 0.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
    right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
    dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

### Variables and Invariants
- The `prefix_sum` list is used to accumulate values but does not change inside the loop.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The `dp_curr` array is updated based on the values from `prefix_sum`.

### Loop Behavior
The loop iterates over the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. For each value of `i`:
- `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
- `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`.
- `dp_curr[i]` is updated using the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

### Output State After All Iterations
- Since `prefix_sum` is computed once before the loop starts and does not change within the loop, it remains constant.
- The value of `i` will reach `2 * max_diff` after the loop completes because the loop runs `2 * max_diff + 1` times, and `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time.

### Calculating the Final State
- The final state of `i` will be `2 * max_diff`.
- Each element `dp_curr[i]` is computed based on the corresponding subarray of `prefix_sum`.

Given the above analysis, we can summarize the final state after the loop has executed all iterations.

### Final Output State
Output State: `prefix_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is `2 * max_diff`, and `dp_curr` is fully populated according to the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` for each `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.

To be precise, the final state is:
- `prefix_sum` remains `[0, dp_prev[0], dp_prev[0] + dp_prev[1], ..., sum(dp_prev) % MOD]`.
- `i` is `2 * max_diff`.
- `dp_curr` is updated such that `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` for all valid `i`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `prefix_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is `2 * max_diff`, and `dp_curr` is fully updated based on the provided formula.
