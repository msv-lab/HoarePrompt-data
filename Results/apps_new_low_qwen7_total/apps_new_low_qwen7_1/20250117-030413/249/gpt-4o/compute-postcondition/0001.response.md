Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common practice when the loop variable is not used inside the loop body.
   - The loop runs `t` times.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop condition is simply the range of `t`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Check the initial state before the loop:**
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `max_diff` is calculated as \(2 \times k \times t\).
   - `dp_prev` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `dp_curr` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is 1.

4. **Determine the necessary conditions for the first iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `k`, `max_diff`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`) do not affect the loop condition directly but must be initialized as specified.

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
