Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `left` is `max(0, 2 - 2 * k)`.
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - `dp_curr` is a list `[0]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be within the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

5. **New State After Incrementing `i`**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - The other states remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, i is 3, left is max(0, 2 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list [0]**
