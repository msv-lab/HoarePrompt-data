Output State: **dp_prev is the previous state of dp_curr before the swap, dp_curr is updated with new values, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from prefix_sum[1] to prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2], which contain the cumulative sums of dp_prev modulo MOD, i is 2 * max_diff + 1, left is calculated as max(0, i - 2 * k), right is calculated as min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr[i] is updated to (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `dp_curr[i]` based on the calculation `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
- The values of `left` and `right` are calculated using the formulas provided.
- The exact values of `left` and `right` depend on the current values of `i` and `k`, but they are determined within the constraints given.
- `dp_curr[i]` is updated with this new value, reflecting the change in the dynamic programming table.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including `dp_prev`, `prefix_sum`, `i`, and the values within `prefix_sum` which are cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.

Since the actual numerical values of `k`, `max_diff`, `dp_prev`, and `prefix_sum` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numbers involved in the computation of `left` and `right`, nor the precise value of `dp_curr[i]`. However, the structure and dependencies are clear from the given code.
