Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. It computes a specific value based on these parameters and prints the result. Hereâ€™s the detailed summary of the function's final state after execution:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function starts with `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` as input, where `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.

2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - A variable `max_diff` is set to `2 * k * t`.
   - Two lists, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`, are initialized as lists of length `2 * max_diff + 1`, both filled with zeros.
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is set to 1.

3. **Main Loop Execution**: The function enters a loop that iterates `t` times. Within each iteration:
   - A `prefix_sum` array is reset to a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3`, all set to zero.
   - A prefix sum array is built from `dp_prev`.
   - For each index `i` in `dp_curr`, the value is calculated using the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique, updating `dp_curr[i]`.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the loop completes, the function calculates the result by summing specific elements of `dp_prev` from index `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`.

5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the sum of the relevant elements of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `t` is 0, the function would not enter the main loop and directly compute the result based on `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]`, which is initially set to 1. However, since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, this case is not explicitly handled in the code.

7. **Final State**:
   - After execution, the function prints a single integer value, which is the result of the computation described above.
   - The state of the program after execution includes `t` being greater than 0, `prefix_sum` being a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` being `2 * max_diff + 2`, `left` being 0, `right` being `2 * max_diff + 1`, and `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` being identical lists of length `2 * max_diff + 1` where each element is calculated as `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
   - The `result` variable holds the final computed value, which is printed.**

This summary covers all aspects of the function's behavior and includes potential edge cases and missing logic.
