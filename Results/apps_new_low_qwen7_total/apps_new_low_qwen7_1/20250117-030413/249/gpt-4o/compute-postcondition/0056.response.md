Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable is `i`. The other variables in the loop head are `max_diff`, which is a constant, and no other variables are directly involved in the loop condition.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff + 1`. This means that at the start of the current iteration, `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2 * max_diff + 2`.

4. **Other States**: The other states such as `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, and `result` remain unchanged for the next iteration because they are not affected by the loop condition itself.

Based on this reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Updated State:**
- `t` is greater than 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `result` is updated as (result + (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0])) \% \text{MOD}

So, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `result` is updated as (result + (\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0])) \% \text{MOD}.**
