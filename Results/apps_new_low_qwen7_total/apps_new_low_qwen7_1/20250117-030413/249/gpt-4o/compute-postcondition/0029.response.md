The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new state for `i` will be `1`.

Since `prefix_sum` remains unchanged and no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, their states remain the same.

State: **`prefix_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `dp_curr[0]` is `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`**
