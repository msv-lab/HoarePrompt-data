The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is an underscore typically used as a throwaway variable to indicate that the loop is iterating a certain number of times without using the index or value in the loop body. Since there are no other variables in the loop head, the only variables that can be adjusted are `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`.

Given that `dp_prev` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, and `dp_curr` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, we need to determine how these states change after each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, both `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` must be updated to their new states:

- `dp_prev` becomes the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
- `dp_curr` becomes the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.

Since the loop iterates `t` times, and we are looking at the state just before the start of the next iteration, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will have swapped values from the previous iteration.

State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, and `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap**
