The code updates the `prefix_sum` list by adding `dp_prev[i]` to `prefix_sum[i]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.

For the current value of `i` (which is 2), the line of code updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` which corresponds to `prefix_sum[3]`:
- `prefix_sum[3] = (prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`

Since `prefix_sum[2]` is 0 (as all elements except `prefix_sum[1]` are zero), the equation simplifies to:
- `prefix_sum[3] = (0 + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = dp_prev[2] % MOD`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` remains greater than 0
- `i` is now 3 (incremented from 2)
- `prefix_sum[3]` is now `dp_prev[2] % MOD`
- All other elements in `prefix_sum` remain 0

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `dp_prev[2] % MOD`, and all other elements are 0.**
