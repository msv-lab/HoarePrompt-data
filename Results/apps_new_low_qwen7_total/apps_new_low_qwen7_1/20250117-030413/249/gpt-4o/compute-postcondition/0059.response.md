The code updates the variable `result` by adding `dp_prev[i]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\)

After executing the line `result = (result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`, the value of `result` changes, but the exact new value depends on the initial value of `result` and the value of `dp_prev[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) filled with zeros, `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 2\), `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where each element is calculated as \((\text{prefix_sum}[2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1] - \text{prefix_sum}[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `result` is updated as (result + dp_prev[i]) \% MOD.**
