Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case includes the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`. Given `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `2 * max_diff + 1 > 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will now be `prefix_sum[3]` and will be updated to `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the current state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0 except `prefix_sum[1]` which is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `i` is 2, `prefix_sum[3]` is `(prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD`**
