Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
- `i` is 1.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 0.
- `dp_curr` is a list with one element which is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` ranges from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of the loop, which is from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.

Since `i` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. However, the states of other variables (`t`, `prefix_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr`) do not change within the loop head itself. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros.
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains 0.
- `dp_curr` remains a list with one element which is 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `dp_curr` is a list with one element which is 0**
