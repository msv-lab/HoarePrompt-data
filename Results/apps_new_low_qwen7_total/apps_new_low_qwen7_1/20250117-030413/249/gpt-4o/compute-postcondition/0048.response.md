Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, `prefix_sum`, and `max_diff`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap.
   - `dp_curr` is updated with new values.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`.
   - `i` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
   - `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - `dp_curr[i]` is updated to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from `0` and increases by `1` each iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `0`.
   - `left` and `right` are recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain the same because they are not updated within the loop but rather swapped outside the loop.

5. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `0`.
   - `left` will be `max(0, 0 - 2 * k) = max(0, -2 * k) = 0`.
   - `right` will be `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1 = min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`.

Given these updates, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp_prev` is the previous state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is updated with new values, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `2 * max_diff + 3` with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`, which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `0`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`**
