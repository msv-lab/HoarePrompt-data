Output State: **dp_prev is the previous state of dp_curr before the swap, dp_curr[0] is ((prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, i - 2 * k)]) % MOD), prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from prefix_sum[1] to prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] which contain the cumulative sums of dp_prev modulo MOD, i is 0, left is 0, right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1**

Explanation:
1. The variable `left` is set to `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Given that `i` is `0`, this expression evaluates to `max(0, 0 - 2 * k)`, which simplifies to `max(0, -2 * k)`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `-2 * k` is negative, so `left` is set to `0`.
2. The variable `right` is set to `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Given that `i` is `0`, this expression evaluates to `min(2 * max_diff, 0 + 2 * k) + 1`, which simplifies to `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`. This means `right` is set to the minimum of `2 * max_diff` and `2 * k`, plus `1`.
3. The variable `dp_curr[i]` is updated to the value of `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Given that `left` is `0` and `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`, this expression evaluates to `(prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`. Since `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `dp_curr[0]` becomes `prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] % MOD`.

All other variables (`dp_prev`, `prefix_sum`, `i`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged, as they are not reassigned outside of the current context.
