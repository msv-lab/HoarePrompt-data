`dp_prev` is assigned the current value of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` is assigned the current value of `dp_prev`. This effectively swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp_prev` is the updated state of `dp_curr` before the swap, `dp_curr` is the previous state of `dp_prev` before the swap, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * `max_diff` + 3 with all elements initialized to 0, except for the elements from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` which contain the cumulative sums of `dp_prev` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `dp_curr[i]` is ((`prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` - `prefix_sum[0]`) % `MOD`).**
