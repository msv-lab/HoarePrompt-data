The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. Each of `a`, `b`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. 

Based on the provided output cases, there are two possible return values:
- Case_1: If a certain condition related to `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` is met, the function returns a specific value (which is not detailed in the snippet but implied to exist).
- Case_2: If a different condition related to `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` is met, the function returns another specific value (also not detailed in the snippet but implied to exist).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integers `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` within specified ranges and return a specific value based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`, and returns a specific value based on certain conditions related to these parameters.**
