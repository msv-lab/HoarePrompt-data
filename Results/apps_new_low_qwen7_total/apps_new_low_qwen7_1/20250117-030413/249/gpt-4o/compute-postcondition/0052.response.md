Output State: t is greater than 0, prefix_sum is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD, and all elements of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are the same after t iterations.

### Analysis and Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `max_diff` is set to 2 * k * t.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1, both initially filled with zeros.
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)]` is 1.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum` is reset to a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3, all set to zero.
   - A prefix sum array is built up from the `dp_prev` array.
   - For each position `i` in `dp_curr`, the value is computed using the prefix sum array and the sliding window technique.

3. **Invariants**:
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The structure of the loops and computations ensures that `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap roles after each iteration but maintain the same values within their respective roles.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After `t` iterations, both `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will contain the same values because they continuously swap roles while maintaining the same state due to the nature of the loop and the way the `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` lists are updated.
   - The `prefix_sum` array is rebuilt from scratch in each iteration, but its structure remains consistent with the cumulative sums of the `dp_prev` array.
   - All `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` elements are calculated based on the prefix sum values, ensuring consistency across iterations.

### Conclusion:
The output state after the loop has executed `t` times is that `t` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length 2 * max_diff + 3 filled with zeros, `i` is 2 * max_diff + 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * max_diff + 1, and `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are identical lists of length 2 * max_diff + 1 where each element is calculated as (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD.
