The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. After this operation, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be the integers provided by the input, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `m` is greater than or equal to `n`; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive**
