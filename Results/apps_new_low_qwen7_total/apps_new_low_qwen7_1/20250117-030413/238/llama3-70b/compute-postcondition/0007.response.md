Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). It prints the minimum value between two expressions: \( \text{min}(m // n, m - (n - 1)) \) if \( k = 1 \), and \( \text{min}(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)) \) otherwise. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Potential edge cases include when \( k > n \), which is not handled in the given code, leading to an incorrect behavior since the condition \( k \leq n \) is not checked explicitly.**
