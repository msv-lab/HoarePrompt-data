The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. The constraints are that `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9`, and `k` is an integer where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The function has two cases based on the relationship between `k` and the range defined by `n` and `m`.

- **Case_1:** If `k` is less than `n`, the function returns an error message indicating that `k` is out of the valid range.
- **Case_2:** If `k` is within the range `[n, m]`, the function returns the value of `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and return `k` if it falls within the range `[n, m]`, or an error message if `k` is less than `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, it returns an error message. If `k` is within the range `[n, m]`, it returns `k`.**
