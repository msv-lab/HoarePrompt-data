You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
