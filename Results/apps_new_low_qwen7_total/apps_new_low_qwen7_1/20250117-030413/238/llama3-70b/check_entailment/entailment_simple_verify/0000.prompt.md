You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else:
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k == 1) :
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else :
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. If `k` equals 1, the function prints `m // n`. Otherwise, the function compares `m // n + 1` and `m - n + k` to determine the output.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Frodo's bed has the highest index (k = n). Specifically, the logic in the `else` block does not account for the scenario where Frodo's bed is the last bed in the row. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the following input:

- Input: `3 6 3`

According to the problem description, Frodo can have 3 pillows (by giving 2 pillows to the hobbit on the first bed and 1 pillow to the hobbit on the second bed). However, the program would incorrectly calculate the result as follows:

```
(k == 1) is False
print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))  # prints min(6 // 3 + 1, 6 - (3 - 3)) -> min(3, 6) -> 3
```

This calculation is correct, but the issue lies in other similar scenarios where the logic does not correctly adjust the distribution of pillows when Frodo's bed is at the end. For instance, in the correct solution, we need to ensure that the distribution of pillows is such that no hobbit has at least two fewer pillows than their neighbor. The given implementation does not fully address this requirement for all cases.
