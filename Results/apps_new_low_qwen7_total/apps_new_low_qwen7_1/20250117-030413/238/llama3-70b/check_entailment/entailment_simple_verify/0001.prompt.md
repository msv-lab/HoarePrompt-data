You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else:
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k == 1) :
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else :
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. If `k` equals 1, the function prints `m // n`. Otherwise, the function compares `m // n + 1` and `m - n + k` to determine the output.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it works and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Edge Case for First Bed**: 
   - If \( k = 1 \), the program prints the minimum of \( \text{m} // n \) (the floor division of \( m \) by \( n \)) and \( \text{m} - (n - 1) \).
   - This edge case handles the scenario where Frodo is on the first bed. It calculates the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have without causing any hobbit to be "hurt" (i.e., having at least two fewer pillows than a neighbor).

3. **General Case**:
   - For other cases (i.e., when \( k > 1 \)), the program prints the minimum of \( \text{m} // n + 1 \) and \( \text{m} - (n - k) \).
   - This calculation ensures that Frodo has one more pillow than the average distribution and accounts for the pillows distributed among the remaining beds.

4. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - For the example `4 6 2`, the program correctly outputs `2`. Here, the first hobbit can get 2 pillows, and the rest can get 1 pillow each.
   - For `3 10 3`, the program outputs `4`. Here, the third hobbit (Frodo) can get 4 pillows, and the others can get 3 and 3 pillows respectively.
   - For `3 6 1`, the program outputs `3`. Here, the first hobbit can get 3 pillows, and the others can get 1 and 2 pillows respectively.

The logic seems sound and the examples provided support its correctness. Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
