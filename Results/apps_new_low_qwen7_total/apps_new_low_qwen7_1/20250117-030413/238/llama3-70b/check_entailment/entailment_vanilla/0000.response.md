Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it works and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Edge Case for First Bed**: 
   - If \( k = 1 \), the program prints the minimum of \( \text{m} // n \) (the floor division of \( m \) by \( n \)) and \( \text{m} - (n - 1) \).
   - This edge case handles the scenario where Frodo is on the first bed. It calculates the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have without causing any hobbit to be "hurt" (i.e., having at least two fewer pillows than a neighbor).

3. **General Case**:
   - For other cases (i.e., when \( k > 1 \)), the program prints the minimum of \( \text{m} // n + 1 \) and \( \text{m} - (n - k) \).
   - This calculation ensures that Frodo has one more pillow than the average distribution and accounts for the pillows distributed among the remaining beds.

4. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - For the example `4 6 2`, the program correctly outputs `2`. Here, the first hobbit can get 2 pillows, and the rest can get 1 pillow each.
   - For `3 10 3`, the program outputs `4`. Here, the third hobbit (Frodo) can get 4 pillows, and the others can get 3 and 3 pillows respectively.
   - For `3 6 1`, the program outputs `3`. Here, the first hobbit can get 3 pillows, and the others can get 1 and 2 pillows respectively.

The logic seems sound and the examples provided support its correctness. Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
