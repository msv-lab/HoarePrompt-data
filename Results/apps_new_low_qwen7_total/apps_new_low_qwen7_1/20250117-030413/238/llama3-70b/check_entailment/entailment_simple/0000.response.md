Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Edge Case for `k == 1`**: 
   - When `k == 1`, the logic to calculate the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have is:
     - `m // n`: This calculates the average number of pillows per hobbit when distributed equally.
     - `m - (n - 1)`: This ensures that the remaining pillows are given to the hobbits starting from the second bed, so Frodo gets at least one pillow plus any leftover pillows.
     - The function returns the minimum of these two values, ensuring Frodo gets the maximum possible pillows while meeting the constraints.

3. **General Case (`k > 1`)**:
   - When `k > 1`, the logic to calculate the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have is:
     - `m // n + 1`: This adds one more pillow to Frodo compared to the average, ensuring he gets more pillows than the average hobbit.
     - `m - (n - k)`: This ensures that the remaining pillows are distributed such that Frodo gets enough pillows to satisfy the condition that no hobbit has at least two fewer pillows than their neighbor.
     - The function returns the minimum of these two values, ensuring Frodo gets the maximum possible pillows while meeting the constraints.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the calculated value.

Given the logic and calculations, the program correctly handles both edge cases and general cases according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
