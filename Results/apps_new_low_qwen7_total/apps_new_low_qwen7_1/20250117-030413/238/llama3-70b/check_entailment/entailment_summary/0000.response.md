Reasoning:
- The problem requires distributing pillows among \( n \) hobbits such that each hobbit gets at least one pillow, Frodo on the \( k \)-th bed gets the maximum possible pillows, and no hobbit feels hurt.
- The provided solution attempts to handle the distribution based on the position of Frodo's bed (\( k \)).
- For \( k = 1 \), the code correctly calculates the maximum pillows Frodo can have by considering the total pillows divided by the number of hobbits and adjusting for the remaining pillows.
- For \( k > 1 \), the code adds 1 to the quotient of total pillows divided by the number of hobbits, again adjusting for the remaining pillows. This approach seems to handle the general case appropriately.
- However, the code does not explicitly check if \( k \leq n \). If \( k > n \), the logic would still run without raising an error, which is logically incorrect as \( k \) cannot exceed the number of hobbits.
- The edge case where \( k > n \) should be handled separately, but the current implementation assumes \( k \leq n \) implicitly, which could lead to incorrect results if \( k \) is larger than \( n \).

Given these points, the current implementation is close to being correct but lacks proper handling of the edge case where \( k > n \).

Correctness: **False**
