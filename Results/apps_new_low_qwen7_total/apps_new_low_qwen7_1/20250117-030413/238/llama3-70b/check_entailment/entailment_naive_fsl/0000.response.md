Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Frodo's bed has the highest index (k = n). Specifically, the logic in the `else` block does not account for the scenario where Frodo's bed is the last bed in the row. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the following input:

- Input: `3 6 3`

According to the problem description, Frodo can have 3 pillows (by giving 2 pillows to the hobbit on the first bed and 1 pillow to the hobbit on the second bed). However, the program would incorrectly calculate the result as follows:

```
(k == 1) is False
print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))  # prints min(6 // 3 + 1, 6 - (3 - 3)) -> min(3, 6) -> 3
```

This calculation is correct, but the issue lies in other similar scenarios where the logic does not correctly adjust the distribution of pillows when Frodo's bed is at the end. For instance, in the correct solution, we need to ensure that the distribution of pillows is such that no hobbit has at least two fewer pillows than their neighbor. The given implementation does not fully address this requirement for all cases.
