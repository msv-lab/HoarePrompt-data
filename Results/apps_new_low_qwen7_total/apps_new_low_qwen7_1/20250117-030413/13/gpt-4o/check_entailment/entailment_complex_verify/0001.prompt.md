You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). It processes the string `trophies` to find segments of consecutive 'G's and determines the longest such segment.

1. The function first identifies all segments of consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies` and stores them in the list `segments`.
2. If there are no segments of 'G's, the function returns 0.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of these segments.
4. It then checks if the segments are adjacent to each other with exactly one 'S' between them. If so, it updates the maximum length to account for the additional 'G' that could be added.
5. Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length incremented by 1 and the original `n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If there are no 'G's in `trophies`, it returns 0.
- If the segments of 'G's are not adjacent but have more than one 'S' between them, the function still returns the maximum length of the segments without further adjustments.
- If the segments are adjacent but the maximum length is already the full length of `trophies`, the function returns `n`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length incremented by 1 and `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input and processes it correctly.
2. **Segmentation of Golden Trophies**: The program identifies and segments consecutive golden trophies into tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index)`. This is done correctly.
3. **Single Segment Case**: If there is only one segment of golden trophies, the program returns its length directly. This is also correct.
4. **Handling Multiple Segments**: For multiple segments, the program considers the possibility of merging adjacent segments with exactly one silver trophy between them. It calculates the potential new length if a swap is made to merge these segments and updates the maximum possible length accordingly.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no golden trophies or only one segment of golden trophies correctly.

Given this analysis, the provided implementation seems to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
