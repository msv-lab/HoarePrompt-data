Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `i` is equal to `n`, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, and the length of `segments` is 1**
