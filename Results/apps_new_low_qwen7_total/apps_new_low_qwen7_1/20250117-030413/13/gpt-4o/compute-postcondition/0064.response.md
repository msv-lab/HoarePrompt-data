The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in the string 'trophies'.
- Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between `max_length` incremented by 1 and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and return either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length incremented by 1 and `n`.
