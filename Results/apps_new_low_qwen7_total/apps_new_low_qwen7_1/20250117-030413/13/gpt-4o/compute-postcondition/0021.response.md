Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
   - `i` is such that `i + 1` is equal to `n` and `trophies[i + 1] == 'G'`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` must hold true.
   - Given `i + 1 == n`, it implies that `i == n - 1`.
   - Since `trophies[i + 1] == 'G'` (which translates to `trophies[n] == 'G'`), this condition is always true because the string is indexed from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `i < n` holds true.
   - Currently, `i == n - 1`, so to satisfy `i < n`, we need to decrease `i` by 1.
   - Decreasing `i` by 1 means `i` should be `n - 2`.

### Final State:
- Adjust `i` to `n - 2`.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is such that `i == n - 2`**
