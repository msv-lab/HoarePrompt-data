Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`. The current value of `i` is `n`, and there are no segments in `segments` (i.e., `segments` is an empty list).**
