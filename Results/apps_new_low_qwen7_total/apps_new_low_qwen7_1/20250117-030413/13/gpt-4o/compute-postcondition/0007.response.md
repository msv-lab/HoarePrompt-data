The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be undefined. However, after the code is executed, `i` will be increased by 1. The conditions for `n` and `trophies[2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `trophies[2]` must be 'G'; variable `i` is increased by 1**
