The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing one element which is an integer (initially empty), `i` is 2, `trophies[1]` must be 'G', `start` is 1**
