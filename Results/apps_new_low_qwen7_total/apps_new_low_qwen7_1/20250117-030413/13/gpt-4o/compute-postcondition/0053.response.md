Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `prev_start` is `a`, `prev_end` is `b`, `curr_start` is `b + 2`, `curr_end` is `d`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - a + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `max_length`, `i`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged.***
