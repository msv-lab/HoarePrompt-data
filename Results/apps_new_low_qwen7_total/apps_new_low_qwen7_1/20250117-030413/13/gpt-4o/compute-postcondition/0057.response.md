Postcondition: ***`prev_start` is `start1`, `prev_end` is `end1`, `curr_start` is `start2`, `curr_end` is `end2`, `max_length` is updated to \(\max(\text{max\_length}, \text{end2} - \text{start2} + \text{end1} - \text{start1} + 3)\) if and only if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, the values of `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, `curr_end`, and `max_length` remain as they were before the if-else block.***
