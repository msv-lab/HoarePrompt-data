The provided code initializes two variables: `segments` as an empty list and `i` as 0. However, there are no further operations on these variables within the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `segments` and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.

Since the code does not modify `n` or `trophies`, their values remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', segments is an empty list [], i is 0**
