The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple `(start, i - 1)` to the list `segments`. The values of `start` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous values. The other variables (`n`, `trophies`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`start` remains `i`; `n` remains the same; `trophies` remains the same; `segments` now contains the additional element `(start, i - 1)`; `i` is the index of the first non-'G' character in `trophies`, or `n` if all characters are 'G'.**
