The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable with the maximum value between its current value and the calculated expression `(curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. The term `curr_end - curr_start + 1` represents the length of the current segment.
2. The term `prev_end - prev_start + 1` represents the length of the previous segment.
3. Adding 1 to each of these lengths accounts for overlapping or consecutive segments.

Given that the current difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is 2, it implies that `curr_start = prev_end + 2`.

Let's assume the values for `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` are as follows (since exact values aren't given, we'll use symbolic representation):

- `prev_start` is `a`
- `prev_end` is `b`
- `curr_start` is `b + 2`
- `curr_end` is `d`

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, (d - (b + 2) + 1) + (b - a + 1) + 1) \]
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, (d - b - 1) + (b - a + 1) + 1) \]
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, d - b - 1 + b - a + 1 + 1) \]
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, d - a + 1) \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `d` are not provided, we can leave the expression as is. However, the key point is that `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the computed value.

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and \(d - a + 1\), `i` is 1, `prev_start` is `a`, `prev_end` is `b`, `curr_start` is `b + 2`, `curr_end` is `d`.**
