Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the conditions `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

2. **Check Each Condition**:
   - **Condition 1**: `i < n`
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
     - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
     - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

   - **Condition 2**: `trophies[i] == 'G'`
     - It is given that `trophies[1]` must be 'G'.
     - For `i = 2`, `trophies[2]` must be 'G' for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - To ensure `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - To ensure `trophies[i] == 'G'`, `trophies[2]` must be 'G'.

4. **Final State**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `trophies[2]` must be 'G'.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `trophies[2]` must be 'G'**
