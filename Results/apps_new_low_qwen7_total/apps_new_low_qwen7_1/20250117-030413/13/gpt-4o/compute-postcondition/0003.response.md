The code `start = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `start`. Given that `i` is initially set to 1 because `trophies[i]` was checked and found to be 'G', the variable `start` will now hold the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing one element which is an integer (initially empty), `i` is 1, `start` is 1**
