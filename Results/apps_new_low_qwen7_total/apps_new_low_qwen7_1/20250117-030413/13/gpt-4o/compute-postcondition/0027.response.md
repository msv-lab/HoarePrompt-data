Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` gets an additional element `(start, i - 1)`, where `start` is the initial value of `i`, and `i` becomes the smallest index such that `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i = n` if all characters in `trophies` are 'G'. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `i` is increased by 1.***
