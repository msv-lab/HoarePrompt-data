The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state is that `start` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `trophies[i + 2]` must be 'G'. After executing the code, the value of `i` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `trophies[i + 3]` must be 'G', `i` is increased by 1.**
