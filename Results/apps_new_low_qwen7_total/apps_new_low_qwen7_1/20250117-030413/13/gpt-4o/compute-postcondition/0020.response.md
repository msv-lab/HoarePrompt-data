The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i + 1 < n` and `trophies[i + 1] == 'G'` before the increment, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i + 1` will no longer satisfy the condition `i + 1 < n` (because `i + 1` will become `n`). Therefore, the new condition for `i + 1` is that it is equal to `n`. The values of `n` and `trophies` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is such that `i + 1` is equal to `n` and `trophies[i + 1] == 'G'`**
