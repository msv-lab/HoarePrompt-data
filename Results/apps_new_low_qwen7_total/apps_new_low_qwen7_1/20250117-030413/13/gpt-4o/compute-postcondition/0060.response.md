The code assigns a value to `max_length` using the maximum function and the given expression. The values of `curr_end`, `curr_start`, `prev_end`, and `prev_start` are used in this expression.

Given the expression:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
```

We can simplify it to:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + prev_end - prev_start + 4)
```

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `max_length`, we assume it is initially set to 0 or a value that will be replaced by the expression. The updated value of `max_length` will be the maximum of its current value and the expression result.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`prev_start` is start1, `prev_end` is end1, `curr_start` is start3, `curr_end` is end3, `max_length` is max(`max_length`, end3 - start3 + 1 + (end1 - start1 + 1) + 1)**
