The code snippet updates the value of `max_length`. It does this by taking the maximum of the current `max_length` and the expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1`: This part calculates the length of the interval `[curr_start, curr_end]`.
- `(prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`: This part adds 1 to the length of the interval `[prev_start, prev_end]`.

So, the expression becomes:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{curr\_start} + 1 + (\text{prev\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 1) + 1) \]

Simplifying further:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{curr\_end} - \text{curr\_start} + \text{prev\_end} - \text{prev\_start} + 3) \]

Given the initial state:
- `prev_start` is `start1`
- `prev_end` is `end1`
- `curr_start` is `start2`
- `curr_end` is `end2`

Substituting these values into the expression:
\[ \text{max\_length} = \max(\text{max\_length}, \text{end2} - \text{start2} + \text{end1} - \text{start1} + 3) \]

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`prev_start` is `start1`, `prev_end` is `end1`, `curr_start` is `start2`, `curr_end` is `end2`, `max_length` is \(\max(\text{max\_length}, \text{end2} - \text{start2} + \text{end1} - \text{start1} + 3)\)**
