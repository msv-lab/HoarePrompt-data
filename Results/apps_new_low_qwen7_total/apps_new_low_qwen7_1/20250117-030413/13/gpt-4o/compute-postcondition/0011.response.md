The code `segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple `(start, i - 1)` to the list `segments`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `segments` is an empty list
- `i` is the smallest index in `trophies` where `trophies[i] != 'G'`, or `n` if all characters are 'G'
- `start` is 1

After executing the code, the list `segments` will contain one additional element, which is the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`segments` is now `[ (1, i - 1) ]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is the smallest index in `trophies` where `trophies[i] != 'G'`, or `n` if all characters are 'G', `start` is 1.**
