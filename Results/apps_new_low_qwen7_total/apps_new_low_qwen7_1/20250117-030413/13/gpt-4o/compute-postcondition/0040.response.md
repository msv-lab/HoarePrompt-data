Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list, and `i` is less than `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `start` remains `i`, `n` remains the same, `trophies` remains the same, `segments` now contains the additional element `(start, i - 1)`, and `i` is the index of the first non-'G' character in `trophies`, or `n` if all characters are 'G'. Otherwise, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list, `i` is less than `n-1`, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.***
