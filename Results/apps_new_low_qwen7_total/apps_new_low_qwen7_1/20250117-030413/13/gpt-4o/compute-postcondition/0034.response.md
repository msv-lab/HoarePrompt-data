Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `start` is `i + 2`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `trophies[i + 1]` must be 'G'

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to continue, two conditions must be satisfied:
  1. `i < n`
  2. `trophies[i] == 'G'`

### Current State at End of Previous Iteration:
- `trophies[i + 1]` must be 'G'. This means `trophies[i]` is 'G' in the current iteration.
- We need to ensure that `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` for the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `trophies[i]` must be 'G' in the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to point to the next character in the string (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
- We need to ensure that `i < n` in the next iteration. Given that `trophies[i + 1]` is 'G' in the current iteration, it means `i + 1` is a valid index and `trophies[i + 1]` is 'G'.

### Updated State:
- `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`.
- The condition `trophies[i + 1]` must be 'G' needs to be maintained.

### Final State:
- `start` remains the same since it is not part of the loop condition.
- `n` remains the same since it is not part of the loop condition.
- `trophies[i + 1]` must still be 'G' to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`start` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `trophies[i + 2]` must be 'G'**.
