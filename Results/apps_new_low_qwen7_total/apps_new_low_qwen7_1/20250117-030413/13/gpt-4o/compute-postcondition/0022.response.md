The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was equal to `n - 2`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` becomes `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is now `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'; `i` is `n - 1`**
