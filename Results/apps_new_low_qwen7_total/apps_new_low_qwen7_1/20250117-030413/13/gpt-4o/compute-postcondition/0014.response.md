Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list, `i` is the smallest index in `trophies` where `trophies[i] != 'G'`, or `n` if all characters are 'G'. If `trophies[i] == 'G'`, then `segments` is updated to include `[ (1, i - 1) ]`. Otherwise, `segments` remains unchanged and `i` is set to 1.***
