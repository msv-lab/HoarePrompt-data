The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Based on the initial state, `i` was such that the condition `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'` was true. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue requires `i + 1 < n` and `trophies[i + 1] == 'G'`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `start` remains `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged, i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` remains a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `trophies[i + 1]` must now be 'G'.

Output State: **`start` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `trophies[i + 1]` must be 'G'.**
