Output State: **prev_start is start1, prev_end is end1, curr_start is start3, curr_end is end3**

Explanation:
- The first line `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the values of `segments[i - 1][0]` (which is `start1`) to `prev_start` and `segments[i - 1][1]` (which is `end1`) to `prev_end`.
- The second line `curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]` assigns the values of `segments[i][0]` (which is `start3`) to `curr_start` and `segments[i][1]` (which is `end3`) to `curr_end`.

No other variables are modified by these lines, so their values remain unchanged. The condition `start3 - end1 == 2` is not relevant to the assignment of values to `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end`.
