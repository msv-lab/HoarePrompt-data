Output State: **i is 1, prev_start and prev_end are the start and end values of the first segment in segments, curr_start and curr_end are the start and end values of the second segment in segments** 

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the start and end values of the segment at index `i - 1` (which is `0` since `i` is 1) from the `segments` list into `prev_start` and `prev_end`.
- The second line unpacks the start and end values of the segment at index `i` (which is `1`) from the `segments` list into `curr_start` and `curr_end`.
- No other variables are affected, and the condition that `len(segments)` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
