The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list [], `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'**
