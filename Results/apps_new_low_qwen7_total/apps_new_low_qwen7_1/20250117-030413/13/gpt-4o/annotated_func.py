#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). It processes the string `trophies` to find segments of consecutive 'G's and determines the longest such segment.

1. The function first identifies all segments of consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies` and stores them in the list `segments`.
2. If there are no segments of 'G's, the function returns 0.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of these segments.
4. It then checks if the segments are adjacent to each other with exactly one 'S' between them. If so, it updates the maximum length to account for the additional 'G' that could be added.
5. Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length incremented by 1 and the original `n`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If there are no 'G's in `trophies`, it returns 0.
- If the segments of 'G's are not adjacent but have more than one 'S' between them, the function still returns the maximum length of the segments without further adjustments.
- If the segments are adjacent but the maximum length is already the full length of `trophies`, the function returns `n`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length incremented by 1 and `n`.
