#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. It returns a list of points representing specific configurations based on the values of `n` and `m`. The possible configurations are:
- If both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.

The function covers all potential edge cases where `n` and `m` are within the specified range and ensures that at least four different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive.
