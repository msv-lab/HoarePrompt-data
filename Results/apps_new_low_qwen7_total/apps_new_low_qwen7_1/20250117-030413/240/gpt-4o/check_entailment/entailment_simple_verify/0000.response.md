### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires selecting 4 different points on a grid from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\) to form a polyline that is as long as possible.
   - Valid inputs ensure there are at least 4 different points on the grid.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads \(n\) and \(m\) as inputs.
   - The function `func_1(n, m)` handles different cases based on the values of \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Case-by-Case Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - **Case 1**: \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\)
     - Points chosen: \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]\)
     - This ensures a long diagonal and vertical/horizontal segments.
   - **Case 2**: \(n = 0\)
     - Points chosen: \([(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]\)
     - This covers the edge case where \(n = 0\).
   - **Case 3**: \(m = 0\)
     - Points chosen: \([(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]\)
     - This covers the edge case where \(m = 0\).
   - **Case 4**: \(n = 1\)
     - Points chosen: \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]\)
     - This covers the edge case where \(n = 1\).
   - **Case 5**: General case when none of the above conditions are met
     - Points chosen: \([(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]\)
     - This ensures a combination of vertical and horizontal segments.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where \(n = 0\), \(m = 0\), and \(n = 1\).
   - For the case where \(n = 0\) and \(m = 0\), the program returns \([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]\), which is invalid since it uses the same point twice. However, the problem statement guarantees at least 4 different points, so this specific case is not applicable.

5. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program after each condition is checked.
   - The function returns a list of points that maximize the length of the polyline under the given constraints.

6. **Original Assessment Reevaluation**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the case where both \(n\) and \(m\) are 0. However, the problem description guarantees at least 4 different points, making this case irrelevant.
   - The program correctly handles all other valid cases and ensures the maximum length of the polyline.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program is correct and handles all valid cases as required by the problem description.

**Final: True**
