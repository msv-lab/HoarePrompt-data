### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and analyze the problem description against the solution.

1. **Problem Description:**
   - We need to choose 4 points on a grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) to form the longest possible polyline.
   - The polyline is defined by the sum of the lengths of the line segments connecting the points.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` selects 4 points based on the values of `n` and `m`.
   - The selected points are designed to cover different cases where the dimensions of the grid might be constrained.
   - The points are then returned in an order that forms the longest possible polyline.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly handles the main cases:
     - Both \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): Points are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - \( n = 0 \): Points are \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
     - \( m = 0 \): Points are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
     - \( n = 1 \): Points are \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - Default case: Points are \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Length Calculation:**
   - For the case where \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \), the length of the polyline is \( n + m + n + m = 2(n + m) \).
   - For other cases, the length is also maximized within the constraints.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The points are printed in the required order, ensuring the polyline is correctly formed and the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Evaluation:

- **Initial Assessment:**
  - The assessment claims the program works correctly for all given constraints and produces the longest possible polyline.

- **Annotations:**
  - The annotations support the initial assessment by clearly detailing the different cases and how the points are selected to maximize the polyline length.

- **Verification:**
  - The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures the polyline is as long as possible by choosing points that maximize the distance between them.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the thorough analysis and the support from the annotations, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

**Final: True**
