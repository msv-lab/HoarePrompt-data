### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, representing the dimensions of the grid.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m)`**:
   - The function aims to determine four points that maximize the length of the polyline formed by these points.
   - Based on the value of \( n \) and \( m \), different configurations of points are generated.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Both \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - This configuration forms a "U" shape and covers the maximum horizontal and vertical distance.
   - **\( n = 0 \) and \( m \geq 1 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n - 1, 0)\).
     - This configuration forms a "V" shape and maximizes the vertical distance.
   - **\( n = 1 \) and \( m \geq 2 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - This configuration forms a "U" shape but restricted to the first column.
   - **\( n = 1 \) and \( m = 0 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), \((0, 1)\).
     - This configuration forms a "U" shape but restricted to the first row.
   - **\( n \geq 2 \) and \( m = 0 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), \((0, 1)\).
     - This configuration forms a "U" shape but restricted to the first row.
   - **\( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \)**:
     - Points are chosen as \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((1, 1)\), \((1, 0)\).
     - This configuration forms a "U" shape but restricted to the first column and row.

4. **Polylines Calculation**:
   - For each configuration, the total length of the polyline is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the line segments.
   - In all cases, the configurations ensure that the polyline is as long as possible given the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the coordinates of the four points in order, ensuring they form the longest possible polyline.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_1(n, m)` correctly determines the four points for the longest polyline in all cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is correct and generates the desired output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
