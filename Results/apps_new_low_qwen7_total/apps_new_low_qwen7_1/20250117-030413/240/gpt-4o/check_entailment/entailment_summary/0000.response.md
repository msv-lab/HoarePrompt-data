Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it adheres to the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, we need to verify that:
1. The program correctly identifies the four points for the polyline when given the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
2. The selected points form the longest possible polyline under the given constraints.

Let's analyze the configurations covered by the `func_1` function:
- For \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): The points are chosen along the boundary of the grid, ensuring the maximum distance between consecutive points.
- For \( n = 0 \) and \( m \geq 1 \): The points are aligned vertically.
- For \( n \geq 1 \) and \( m = 0 \): The points are aligned horizontally.
- For \( n = 1 \) and \( m \geq 1 \): The points are aligned either vertically or horizontally depending on the value of \( m \).

Given these configurations, let's evaluate the logic:
- When \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \), the points `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(n, m)`, and `(0, m)` form the longest possible polyline since they are the farthest apart on the boundary of the grid.
- When \( n = 0 \) and \( m \geq 2 \), the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, m)`, and `(0, m-1)` form the longest possible polyline.
- When \( n = 1 \) and \( m \geq 2 \), the points `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(1, m)`, and `(0, m)` form the longest possible polyline.
- When \( m = 0 \) and \( n \geq 2 \), the points `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(n, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` form the longest possible polyline.
- When \( m = 1 \) and \( n \geq 2 \), the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(n, 1)`, and `(n, 0)` form the longest possible polyline.

Based on this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases and selects the points that form the longest possible polyline.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
