You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. It returns a list of points representing specific configurations based on the values of `n` and `m`. The possible configurations are:
- If both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
- If `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
- If `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 0, the function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 1, the function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.

The function covers all potential edge cases where `n` and `m` are within the specified range and ensures that at least four different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to select four points from the grid to form the longest possible polyline. The given program attempts to cover the main cases where the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) are either large enough or small enough to limit the selection of points.

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - If both \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\), it selects the corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - If \(n = 0\), it selects points along the vertical axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, m-1)\).
   - If \(m = 0\), it selects points along the horizontal axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((n-1, 0)\).
   - If \(n = 1\), it selects points along the vertical axis but shifted horizontally: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - For other cases, it defaults to selecting points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), and \((n, 0)\).

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - The chosen points are designed to maximize the total length of the polyline. Each segment between consecutive points will have the maximum possible length for the given constraints.
   - For example, when \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\), the total length of the polyline is \(n + m + n + m = 2(n + m)\), which is the maximum possible length for a polyline using four points in a rectangle.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the points in the order specified, ensuring that the polyline is correctly formed and the output format matches the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for all given constraints and produce the longest possible polyline.

Correctness: **True**
