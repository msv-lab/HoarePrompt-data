### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step.

#### 1. Input Handling and Validation:
- The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` and validates that they are within the range [0, 1000].
- The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the points to use based on the values of `n` and `m`.

#### 2. Case Analysis in `func_1`:
- **Case 1:** Both \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \):
  - The points selected are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
  - The polyline length would be \( n + m + n + m = 2(n + m) \).
- **Case 2:** \( n = 0 \):
  - The points selected are \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, m-1)\).
  - The polyline length would be \( m - 1 + 1 + (m - 1) = 2(m - 1) \).
- **Case 3:** \( m = 0 \):
  - The points selected are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((n-1, 0)\).
  - The polyline length would be \( n - 1 + 1 + (n - 1) = 2(n - 1) \).
- **Case 4:** \( n = 1 \):
  - The points selected are \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
  - The polyline length would be \( 1 + m + 1 + m = 2(m + 1) \).
- **Default Case:**
  - The points selected are \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), and \((n, 0)\).
  - The polyline length would be \( 1 + (n - 0) + 1 + (n - 0) = 2(n + 1) \).

#### 3. Length Calculation Verification:
- In each case, the points are chosen to maximize the length of the polyline by forming the largest possible segments.
- The chosen points ensure that the total length is maximized for the given constraints.

#### 4. Output Format:
- The program correctly prints the points in the required format, ensuring the polyline is correctly formed and the output format matches the problem requirements.

#### 5. Edge Cases:
- All edge cases (such as \( n = 0 \), \( m = 0 \), etc.) are handled appropriately.
- The function `func_1` ensures that at least four different points are used in the polyline.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the longest possible polyline for any given \( n \) and \( m \) within the specified range. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
