Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 0, which is a valid input according to the problem description. In this case, the grid contains no points, and thus, it is impossible to select 4 different points. The program does not account for this scenario and would attempt to create a polyline using no points, which is invalid. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
