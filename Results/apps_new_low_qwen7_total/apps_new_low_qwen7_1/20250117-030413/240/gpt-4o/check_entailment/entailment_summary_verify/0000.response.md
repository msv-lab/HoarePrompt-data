Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 0. However, the provided function summary helps us understand how the function behaves in various scenarios, and we can verify the correctness of the program based on these summaries.

Let's analyze the function `func_1` based on the provided summaries:

1. **Case (0, 0):**
   - According to the function summary, if both `n` and `m` are 0, the function should return a list of points. However, the function summary does not specify any points for this case. Since the problem guarantees that the grid contains at least 4 different points, this case should never occur. Therefore, the function should not return any points in this case, but since the function returns a list of points even when there are no points available, it is incorrect.

2. **Case (0, 1):**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`, but the last two points are identical, which means it will not form a valid polyline with four distinct points.

3. **Case (0, m) where m > 1:**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`, which forms a valid polyline with four distinct points.

4. **Case (1, 0):**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`, which forms a valid polyline with four distinct points.

5. **Case (1, m) where m > 0:**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`, which forms a valid polyline with four distinct points.

6. **Case (n, 0) where n > 1:**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`, which forms a valid polyline with four distinct points.

7. **Case (n, 1) where n > 1:**
   - The function correctly returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`, which forms a valid polyline with four distinct points.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly handles all cases except for the invalid case where both `n` and `m` are 0. Additionally, the function summary confirms that the function always returns a list of four points, even if they are not distinct, which is incorrect for the case where no points are available.

Since the program does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 0 correctly, and it also does not ensure that the returned points are distinct in some cases, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
