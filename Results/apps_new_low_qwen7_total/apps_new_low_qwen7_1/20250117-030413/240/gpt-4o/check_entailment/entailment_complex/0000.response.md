### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find the configuration of 4 points on a grid that forms the longest possible polyline. The provided solution tries to cover all edge cases by specifying certain configurations for different values of \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Coverage of All Edge Cases**: The function `func_1` should handle all possible combinations of \(n\) and \(m\) within the given constraints.
2. **Correct Calculation of Polyline Length**: For each configuration, the length of the polyline must be maximized.
3. **Output Format**: The output format must match the requirements, i.e., it should consist of 4 points in the order \(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\).

#### Analysis:
1. **When Both \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`.
   - This configuration forms a diagonal line across the grid, ensuring the maximum length of the polyline.
   
2. **When \(n = 0\) and \(m = 1\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`.
   - This is a degenerate case where the polyline is just a single point repeated twice, but it still meets the requirement of having 4 points.
   
3. **When \(n = 0\) and \(m > 1\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
   - This configuration ensures the maximum length of the polyline by spanning from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner.
   
4. **When \(n = 1\) and \(m = 0\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
   - This configuration ensures the maximum length by spanning horizontally across the grid.
   
5. **When \(n = 1\) and \(m > 0\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.
   - This configuration also ensures the maximum length by spanning vertically across the grid.
   
6. **When \(n > 1\) and \(m = 0\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`.
   - This configuration ensures the maximum length by spanning diagonally from the bottom-left to the top-left corner.
   
7. **When \(n > 1\) and \(m = 1\)**:
   - The function returns `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.
   - This configuration ensures the maximum length by spanning vertically across the grid.

Each configuration is designed to maximize the length of the polyline while ensuring that the output consists of exactly 4 points. The logic appears to be correctly implemented for all given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given that the function `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases and provides the required configuration of points to form the longest possible polyline, the provided program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
