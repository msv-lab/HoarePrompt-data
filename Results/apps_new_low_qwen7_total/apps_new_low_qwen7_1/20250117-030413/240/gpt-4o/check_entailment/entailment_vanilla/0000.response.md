Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to select four points from the grid to form the longest possible polyline. The given program attempts to cover the main cases where the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) are either large enough or small enough to limit the selection of points.

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - If both \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\), it selects the corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - If \(n = 0\), it selects points along the vertical axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, m-1)\).
   - If \(m = 0\), it selects points along the horizontal axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((n-1, 0)\).
   - If \(n = 1\), it selects points along the vertical axis but shifted horizontally: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - For other cases, it defaults to selecting points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), and \((n, 0)\).

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - The chosen points are designed to maximize the total length of the polyline. Each segment between consecutive points will have the maximum possible length for the given constraints.
   - For example, when \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\), the total length of the polyline is \(n + m + n + m = 2(n + m)\), which is the maximum possible length for a polyline using four points in a rectangle.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the points in the order specified, ensuring that the polyline is correctly formed and the output format matches the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for all given constraints and produce the longest possible polyline.

Correctness: **True**
