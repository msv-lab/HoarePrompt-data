The code initializes the list `points` with four tuples: `(0, 0)`, `(0, m)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(0, m - 1)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Since `m` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= m <= 1000`, and `m < 2`, the only possible value for `m` is 0 or 1.

- If `m` is 0, the list `points` would be `[(0, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`, which does not satisfy the condition that at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive.
- If `m` is 1, the list `points` would be `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`, which also does not satisfy the condition that at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive.

Since both values for `m` (0 and 1) do not satisfy the condition, there is no valid `m` that meets all the given conditions. However, according to the code, `m` is set to 1, even though this does not strictly meet the condition of having at least 4 different points.

Given the code execution, the variable `points` is updated, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `m` is 1; `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`**
