Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000, and at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` is 0, then `m` is 1 and `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`. If `n` is greater than 0, then `points` is one of the following: if `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`; if `n` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`; if `n` is greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000 and m != 0, and `points` is `[ (0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0) ]`.**
