Output State: **`points` is a list of points based on the values of `n` and `m` as described: if both `n` and `m` are >= 2, `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]`; if `n` is 0 and `m` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`; if `n` is 0 and `m` is > 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`; if `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`; if `n` is 1 and `m` is > 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`; if `n` is > 1 and `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`; if `n` is > 1 and `m` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`**
