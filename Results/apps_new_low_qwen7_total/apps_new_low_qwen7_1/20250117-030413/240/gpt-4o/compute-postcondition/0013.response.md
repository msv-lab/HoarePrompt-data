Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000, and at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` is 1, then `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000, and `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 1000 and n >= 2, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000 and m != 0, with `points` being `[ (0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0) ]`.***
