The code creates a list of tuples called `points` containing four specific points: `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(n, 1)`, and `(n, 0)`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m` directly but initializes the `points` list. The conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 1000 and n >= 2; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000 and m != 0; `points` is `[ (0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0) ]`**
