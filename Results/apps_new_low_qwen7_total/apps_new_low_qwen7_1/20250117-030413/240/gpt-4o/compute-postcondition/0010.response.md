The code creates a list called `points` containing tuples representing coordinates on a grid. Specifically, it initializes `points` with the following values: `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. This does not change the values of `n` or `m`, but it does create the `points` list.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000, at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (1, m) inclusive, and m is not equal to 0; `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`**
