Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `n`, `m` <= 1000 and at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. If `n` and `m` are both greater than or equal to 2, `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. If `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. If `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`. If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 0, `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`. If `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is 1, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.***
