The code snippet defines a list `points` which is assigned the values of four tuples: `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(n - 1, 0)`. This does not change the values of `n` or `m`, but it creates the list `points` with these specific points. Therefore, the output state includes the updated definition of `points` and retains the original conditions for `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 1000 and `n` >= 2; `m` is 0; `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]**
