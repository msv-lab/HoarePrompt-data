The code defines a list `points` containing tuples representing coordinates on a grid. Specifically, it initializes `points` with the coordinates `(0, 0)`, `(n, 0)`, `(n, m)`, and `(0, m)`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `n`, `m` <= 1000 and at least 4 different points exist on the grid from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)].**
