The function takes no explicit parameters and reads two integers `n` and `a` from user input, where \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n\) is even. It then calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `n`. Specifically, if `a` is less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), it prints \(\frac{a}{2} + a \% 2\). If `a` is greater than \(\frac{n}{2}\), it prints \(\frac{n - a + 1}{2} + (n - a + 1) \% 2\). The function ensures that the output is always an integer. This covers all possible cases where `a` can be within the range \(1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000\) and `n` is even.
