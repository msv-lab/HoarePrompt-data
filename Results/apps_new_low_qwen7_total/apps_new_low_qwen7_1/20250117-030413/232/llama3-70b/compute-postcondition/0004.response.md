First, let's break down the given code:

1. The expression `(n - a + 1)` calculates the difference between `n` and `a`, adds 1, and stores this value in a temporary location.
2. This result is then divided by 2 using the integer division operator `//`, which gives the quotient.
3. The remainder of this division is calculated using the modulus operator `%`.
4. These two results are added together, and the final result is printed.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is an integer where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `n` is an even integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`.
- `a` is greater than `n // 2`.

Let's denote `b = n - a + 1`. Since `n` is even and `a` is greater than `n // 2`, `b` is an odd number. This is because subtracting a number greater than half of `n` from `n` and adding 1 will result in an odd number.

Since `b` is odd, when we perform integer division `b // 2`, we get the floor value of `b / 2`, and when we take the modulus `b % 2`, we get 1.

So, the expression `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` simplifies to:

\[
(n - a + 1) // 2 + 1
\]

Because `b` is odd, `(b // 2) + 1` will give us the ceiling value of `b / 2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

\[
\text{ceiling}\left(\frac{n - a + 1}{2}\right)
\]

Since `n - a + 1` is an odd number, the ceiling of its half plus 1 is simply the next integer after the floor division.

Thus, the output is:

Output State: **`1`**
