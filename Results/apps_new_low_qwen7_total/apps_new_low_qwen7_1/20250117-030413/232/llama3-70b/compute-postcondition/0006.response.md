The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given (n and a are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and n is even), it seems that the function might internally use these values. The output is not specified in the code snippet but is described in the output section.

Given the output descriptions, it implies that the function might return different values based on the relationship between `a` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It uses internally defined values `n` and `a` where 1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and n is even, and returns based on the relationship between `a` and `n`.**
