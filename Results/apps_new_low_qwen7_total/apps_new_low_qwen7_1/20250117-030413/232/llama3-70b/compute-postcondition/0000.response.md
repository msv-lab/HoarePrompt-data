`n` and `a` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The input is expected to provide two integers separated by a space, which are then assigned to `n` and `a` respectively. The conditions that `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `n` is even still hold true. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and n is an even integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000;`**
