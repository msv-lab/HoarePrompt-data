Reasoning:
Let's verify if the given Python program correctly calculates the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \(a\).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The houses are arranged such that odd-numbered houses are on one side and even-numbered houses are on the other side.
   - The distance to move between consecutive houses is 1 second.
   - The distance to move from the start to house 1 or house \(n\) is 1 second.
   - Vasya needs to calculate the minimum time to reach house \(a\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads two integers \(n\) and \(a\) from the input.
   - If \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\):
     - The formula used is \(\frac{a}{2} + a \% 2\).
   - If \(a > \frac{n}{2}\):
     - The formula used is \(\frac{n - a + 1}{2} + (n - a + 1) \% 2\).

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - For \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\):
     - If \(a\) is odd, the time taken is \(\frac{a-1}{2} + 1\).
     - If \(a\) is even, the time taken is \(\frac{a}{2}\).
     - Both formulas match the logic for the first half of the street.
   - For \(a > \frac{n}{2}\):
     - The distance to the opposite house is \(n - a + 1\).
     - If \(n - a + 1\) is odd, the time taken is \(\frac{(n - a)}{2} + 1\).
     - If \(n - a + 1\) is even, the time taken is \(\frac{(n - a)}{2}\).
     - Both formulas match the logic for the second half of the street.

Since the provided formulas match the expected behavior for both halves of the street, the program correctly calculates the minimum time.

Correctness: **True**
