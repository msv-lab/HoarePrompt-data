### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The street has `n` houses, with `n` being even.
- Houses are numbered from `1` to `n`.
- Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, and even-numbered houses are on the other side.
- Vasya starts at the beginning of the street and needs to reach house `a`.
- The time taken to travel from the start to houses `1` and `n` is 1 second.
- The time to travel between adjacent houses is 1 second.
- Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between corresponding houses is the same.

#### Given Code Analysis:
- The code reads two integers `n` and `a` from the input.
- It checks if `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`:
  - If true, it calculates the time to reach house `a` directly from the start of the street.
  - If false, it calculates the time to reach house `a` by considering the symmetry of the street.

#### Calculation:
- For `a <= n // 2`, the time to reach house `a` is `a // 2 + a % 2`. This is because:
  - `a // 2` gives the number of steps needed to reach the middle of the street.
  - `a % 2` accounts for the additional step if `a` is odd.
- For `a > n // 2`, the time to reach house `a` is `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. This is because:
  - `n - a + 1` is the position of house `a` on the other side of the street.
  - `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` calculates the time to reach this position.

#### Edge Cases:
- The code handles all cases correctly based on the given constraints and examples provided.
- The logic for calculating the time to reach `a` is sound and matches the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
