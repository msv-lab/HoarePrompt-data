You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. [Image] 

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and a are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and n is even.
def func():
    n, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (a <= n // 2) :
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else :
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq \frac{n}{2}\). If `a` is even, the output is `a // 2`; if `a` is odd, the output is `a // 2 + 1`. If `a` is greater than \(\frac{n}{2}\), the output is `1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function to see if it correctly computes the minimum time for Vasya to reach house \(a\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Even Number of Houses**: The total number of houses \(n\) is always even.
2. **Odd and Even House Numbers**: 
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from 2 to \(n\).
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Vasya takes 1 second to go from the start to either house 1 or house \(n\).
   - Vasya takes 1 second to travel between any two neighboring houses.

#### Function Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Case 1: \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\)**:
  - If \(a\) is less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), it means the house is on the left side of the street.
  - The distance from the start to house \(a\) involves going to the nearest odd-numbered house first (which is always house 1) and then traveling the remaining distance to house \(a\).
  - The number of steps to reach house \(a\) from house 1 is \(a - 1\), which takes \(a // 2 + a \% 2\) seconds (since every two steps take 1 second, plus an extra second if \(a\) is odd).

- **Case 2: \(a > \frac{n}{2}\)**:
  - If \(a\) is greater than \(\frac{n}{2}\), it means the house is on the right side of the street.
  - The distance from the start to house \(a\) involves going to the nearest even-numbered house first (which is \(n\)) and then traveling the remaining distance to house \(a\).
  - The distance to travel is \(n - a + 1\), which takes \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2\) seconds.

Both cases correctly account for the time taken to reach house \(a\) considering the constraints and the nature of the street layout.

#### Testing:
Let's test the function with the provided examples:
- For the input `4 2`, the function correctly outputs `2`.
- For the input `8 5`, the function correctly outputs `3`.

Given this analysis, the provided function appears to be correct.
