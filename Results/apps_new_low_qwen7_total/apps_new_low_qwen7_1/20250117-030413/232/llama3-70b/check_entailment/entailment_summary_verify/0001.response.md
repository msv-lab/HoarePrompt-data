### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the problem and the provided function to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Restatement:
Vasya needs to get to house number \(a\) as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and spends exactly 1 second to go from the start to either house 1 or house \(n\). He also spends exactly 1 second to drive the distance between two neighboring houses. The goal is to find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \(a\).

#### Function Analysis:
The function provided does not explicitly consider the layout of the houses. Instead, it uses a simplified calculation based on the position of \(a\) relative to \(\frac{n}{2}\).

- **Case 1: \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\)**
  - The function prints \(a // 2 + a \% 2\).
  - This calculation assumes Vasya travels to the nearest odd-numbered house (house 1) and then directly to house \(a\).
  - However, since the houses are laid out such that odd-numbered houses are on one side and even-numbered houses are on the other, this approach might not accurately reflect the actual distance traveled.

- **Case 2: \(a > \frac{n}{2}\)**
  - The function prints \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2\).
  - This calculation assumes Vasya travels to the nearest even-numbered house (house \(n\)) and then directly to house \(a\).
  - Again, this approach might not accurately reflect the actual distance traveled due to the layout.

To properly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\), Vasya needs to travel to the nearest odd-numbered house, which is always house 1.
- If \(a > \frac{n}{2}\), Vasya needs to travel to the nearest even-numbered house, which is house \(n\).

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be:
- Calculate the distance to the nearest odd-numbered house for \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\).
- Calculate the distance to the nearest even-numbered house for \(a > \frac{n}{2}\).

For \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\):
- Distance = \(\left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\)

For \(a > \frac{n}{2}\):
- Distance = \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - a + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\)

Let's modify the function accordingly:

```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print((a // 2) + 1)
    else:
        print(((n - a + 1) // 2) + 1)
```

#### Testing:
- For the input `4 2`, the function now correctly outputs `2`.
- For the input `8 5`, the function now correctly outputs `3`.

Given this analysis, the provided function was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the layout of the houses. The modified function correctly calculates the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \(a\).

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
