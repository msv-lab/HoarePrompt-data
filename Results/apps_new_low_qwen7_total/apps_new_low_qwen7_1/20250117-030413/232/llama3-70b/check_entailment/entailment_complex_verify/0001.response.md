### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python function to determine if it correctly computes the minimum time for Vasya to reach house \(a\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Even Number of Houses**: The total number of houses \(n\) is always even.
2. **Odd and Even House Numbers**:
   - Odd-numbered houses are on one side of the street, starting from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - Even-numbered houses are on the other side of the street, starting from 2 to \(n\).
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Vasya takes 1 second to go from the start to either house 1 or house \(n\).
   - Vasya takes 1 second to travel between any two neighboring houses.

#### Function Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
```

- **Case 1: \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\)**:
  - If \(a\) is less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\), it means the house is on the left side of the street.
  - To reach house \(a\):
    - Vasya first goes to house 1, which takes 1 second.
    - Then he travels the remaining distance to house \(a\), which involves \(a - 1\) steps (each step taking 1 second).
  - The total time to reach house \(a\) is \(1 + (a - 1) = a\) seconds.
  - However, the current implementation calculates \(a // 2 + a \% 2\), which is not equivalent to \(a\).

- **Case 2: \(a > \frac{n}{2}\)**:
  - If \(a\) is greater than \(\frac{n}{2}\), it means the house is on the right side of the street.
  - To reach house \(a\):
    - Vasya first goes to house \(n\), which takes 1 second.
    - Then he travels the remaining distance to house \(a\), which involves \(n - a + 1\) steps (each step taking 1 second).
  - The total time to reach house \(a\) is \(1 + (n - a + 1) = n - a + 2\) seconds.
  - However, the current implementation calculates \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2\), which is not equivalent to \(n - a + 2\).

#### Testing:
Let's test the function with the provided examples to see if it works correctly:
- For the input `4 2`:
  - \(a = 2\) and \(n = 4\).
  - According to the function, the output is \(2 // 2 + 2 \% 2 = 1 + 0 = 1\), but the correct time is 2 seconds (1 second to go to house 1 and 1 second to go from house 1 to house 2).
- For the input `8 5`:
  - \(a = 5\) and \(n = 8\).
  - According to the function, the output is \((8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) \% 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 \% 2 = 2 + 0 = 2\), but the correct time is 3 seconds (1 second to go to house 8 and 2 seconds to go from house 8 to house 5).

Based on these observations, the function does not correctly compute the minimum time required for Vasya to reach house \(a\).

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
