Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses two integers, `n` and `a`, from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \(a \leq \frac{n}{2}\):
     - In this case, the function prints \(\frac{a}{2} + a \% 2\).
     - For an odd `a`, \(\frac{a}{2}\) gives the quotient and \(a \% 2\) gives the remainder (which is 1). So, the expression \(\frac{a}{2} + 1\) correctly calculates the distance.
     - For an even `a`, \(\frac{a}{2}\) gives the quotient and \(a \% 2\) gives 0. So, the expression \(\frac{a}{2}\) correctly calculates the distance.
   - If \(a > \frac{n}{2}\):
     - The function calculates \(n - a + 1\), which effectively flips the house number to the opposite side.
     - Then it prints \(\frac{n - a + 1}{2} + (n - a + 1) \% 2\).
     - Similar to the previous case, for an odd \(n - a + 1\), the expression correctly gives the distance, and for an even \(n - a + 1\), the expression correctly gives the distance.

Given these points, the logic correctly handles both cases where the house is on the left or right side of the street and accounts for whether the house number is odd or even.

Therefore, the provided function accurately calculates the minimum time required for Vasya to reach house `a`.

Correctness: **True**
