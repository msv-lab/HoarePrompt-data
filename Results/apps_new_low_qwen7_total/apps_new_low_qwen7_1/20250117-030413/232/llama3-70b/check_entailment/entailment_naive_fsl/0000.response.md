Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario when `a` is greater than `n/2`. According to the problem description, if `a` is greater than `n/2`, Vasya would need to drive past the midpoint of the street to reach the corresponding house on the opposite side. However, the program incorrectly calculates the time as if `a` were less than or equal to `n/2`.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 5
```
According to the problem description, to reach house 5, Vasya needs to go past the midpoint (house 4) and then drive to house 5, which is 3 seconds in total. However, the program outputs:
```
3
```
which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that Vasya needs to drive past the midpoint first. The correct output should be:
```
3
```
But the program fails to handle this correctly, hence the program is incorrect.
