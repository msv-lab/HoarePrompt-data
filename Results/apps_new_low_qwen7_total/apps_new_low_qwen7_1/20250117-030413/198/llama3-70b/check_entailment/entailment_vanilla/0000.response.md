### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - This involves checking pairs of problems `(x, y)` such that `x < y` and the number of accepted solutions for `y` is not strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for `x`.
   - The input consists of the number of problems `n` and the range `[l_i, r_i]` for the number of accepted solutions for each problem `i`.

2. **Solution Overview:**
   - To ensure there are no inversions, for every pair of problems `(x, y)` where `x < y`, the number of accepted solutions for `y` should not be strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for `x`.
   - This condition can be simplified to ensuring `r_x >= l_y` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x < y`.
   - If this condition holds for all pairs, the number of valid sequences is the product of the probabilities for each individual problem.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - For each problem `i`, the probability that no inversion occurs involving `i` is the sum of probabilities that `r_i` (the maximum possible accepted solutions) is at least `l_j` (the minimum possible accepted solutions) for all problems `j > i`.
   - This can be computed using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods, but the given code does not implement this logic correctly.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code includes three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) which are used for modular multiplication and modular exponentiation, essential for handling large numbers.
   - However, the main logic for solving the problem is missing. The functions do not implement the necessary calculations to determine the probability of no inversions.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct for the given task.

**Correctness: **False**
