### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - This involves ensuring that for every pair of problems `(x, y)` where `x < y`, the number of accepted solutions for `y` is not strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for `x`.
   - The input consists of the number of problems `n` and the range `[l_i, r_i]` for the number of accepted solutions for each problem `i`.

2. **Solution Overview:**
   - To ensure there are no inversions, for every pair of problems `(x, y)` where `x < y`, the number of accepted solutions for `y` should not be strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for `x`.
   - This condition can be simplified to ensuring `r_x >= l_y` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x < y`.
   - If this condition holds for all pairs, the number of valid sequences is the product of the probabilities for each individual problem.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - For each problem `i`, the probability that no inversion occurs involving `i` is the sum of probabilities that `r_i` (the maximum possible accepted solutions) is at least `l_j` (the minimum possible accepted solutions) for all problems `j > i`.
   - This can be computed using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods, but the given code does not implement this logic correctly.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code includes three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) which are used for modular multiplication and modular exponentiation, essential for handling large numbers.
   - These functions are correctly implemented and are likely to be used in the final solution, but the main logic for solving the problem is missing.
   - Specifically, the code does not include the logic to compute the probability of no inversions based on the ranges `[l_i, r_i]` for each problem.

5. **Function Summaries:**
   - `func_3` computes the modular inverse of `a` using `func_2`, which performs modular exponentiation.
   - `func_2` is a fast exponentiation function that calculates `a^b % MOD`.
   - `func_1` simply performs modular multiplication, which is used by `func_2`.

6. **Main Logic Missing:**
   - The core logic required to calculate the probability of no inversions is not present in the given code.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are utility functions and do not directly contribute to solving the problem as stated.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
