Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, given the constraints on the number of accepted solutions for each problem. This involves computing the product of certain probabilities for each problem.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of problems `n` and the ranges `[l_i, r_i]` for each problem.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function multiplies two integers and takes the modulus with respect to `998244353`. This is used for intermediate multiplications in the probability calculations.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function implements modular exponentiation using repeated squaring. It calculates `a^b % MOD`.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function calculates the modular inverse of `a` modulo `998244353` by calling `func_2(a, MOD - 2)`.

3. **Code Logic**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(n):`) calculates the probability that the current problem does not have a higher number of solutions than any subsequent problem.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(n):`) adjusts the probability for each problem individually, considering the range of possible solutions.
   - The final output is the calculated probability modulo `998244353`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is correctly implemented to handle large integer multiplications under modulo arithmetic.
   - `func_2` correctly implements modular exponentiation, which is crucial for calculating the inverse probabilities.
   - `func_3` correctly computes the modular inverse, which is necessary for the final probability calculation.

5. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic required to compute the probability of having no inversions.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the intermediate and final results remain within the specified bounds.
   - The provided examples match the expected outputs, indicating that the implementation is correct.

Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
