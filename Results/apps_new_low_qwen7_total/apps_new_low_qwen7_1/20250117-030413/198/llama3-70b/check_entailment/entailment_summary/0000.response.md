Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic and verify each part:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of problems `n` and the ranges `[l_i, r_i]` for each problem.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For each problem `i`, the number of accepted solutions is uniformly distributed between `l_i` and `r_i`.
   - The goal is to calculate the probability that the sequence of accepted solutions does not contain any inversions, i.e., the sequence is non-decreasing.
   - To achieve this, the program calculates the probability that the next problem's solution count is at least as much as the current problem's solution count.
   - For each problem `i`, the number of ways the next problem `j` (where `j > i`) can have at least as many solutions as `i` is calculated using `func_1(cnt, a[j][1] - a[i][0] + 1)`. This is essentially counting the number of valid ranges for the next problem that satisfy the condition.
   - After calculating the cumulative product of these probabilities, the program further adjusts the probability for each problem individually to account for the valid ranges of its own solutions using `func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1)`.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The program ensures all calculations are done modulo `998244353` using `func_1`, which performs the required modular multiplication.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the desired probability. Each function call and the overall flow align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
