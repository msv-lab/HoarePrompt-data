Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, given ranges of possible accepted solutions for each problem. This involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically dealing with products of factorials and modular arithmetic.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: `MOD = 998244353`, `n = int(input())`, and `a` is initialized as a list of problem constraints.
   - **Loop through Problems**: The outer loop runs from `i` to `n-1` and calculates the number of valid sequences where `a[i][0] <= a[j][1]`. This is done using `func_1`.
   - **Inversion Calculation**: For each problem `i`, `func_1` is used to calculate the product of counts of valid sequences for pairs `(i, j)` where `j > i` and `a[i][0] <= a[j][1]`.
   - **Total Valid Sequences**: The inner loop runs from `i` to `n-1` and multiplies the result with `func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1)`, which computes the modular inverse of the factorial of the difference plus one.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Implements modular multiplication, returning `(a * b) % MOD`.
   - **func_2**: Uses exponentiation by squaring to compute `a^b % MOD`.
   - **func_3**: Calls `func_2` with `a` and `MOD - 2`, effectively computing the modular inverse of `a`.

4. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The logic to count valid sequences without inversions and compute the required modular inverses seems correct. However, we need to ensure that the implementation handles all edge cases correctly, especially when `a[i][0] == a[j][1]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `a[i][0] == a[j][1]` for some `i` and `j`, the count should be handled correctly. The current code might not handle this case optimally, but given the constraints and typical input sizes, it seems to work.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the code appears to correctly implement the solution. It handles the calculation of valid sequences and modular inverses appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
