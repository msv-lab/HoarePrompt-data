### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - An inversion is defined as a pair of problems `(x, y)` such that `x < y` and the number of accepted solutions for `y` is strictly greater than the number of accepted solutions for `x`.
   - We need to ensure that for each problem `i`, the number of accepted solutions for `i` is at least as high as the minimum number of accepted solutions for any subsequent problem.

2. **Solution Overview:**
   - The provided code attempts to calculate the probability of no inversions by iterating through each problem and counting the valid ranges.
   - It uses modular arithmetic functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to handle large numbers, but the core logic for determining the probability is missing.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Implements modular multiplication.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Implements modular exponentiation using repeated squaring.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Uses `func_2` to compute the modular inverse.
   - The main part of the code initializes `res` to 1 and iterates through each problem `i`:
     - It calculates `cnt` as the product of the valid ranges for all subsequent problems `j` where `a[i][0] <= a[j][1]`.
     - It updates `res` by multiplying `res` with `cnt`.
   - After the outer loop, it further multiplies `res` by the modular inverses of the ranges for each problem.

4. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Initial State:** `res` is initialized to 1.
   - **Inner Loop:** For each problem `i`, `cnt` is calculated as the product of ranges for all subsequent problems `j` where `a[i][0] <= a[j][1]`. This ensures that the number of accepted solutions for `i` is at least as high as the minimum for any subsequent problem.
   - **Outer Loop:** The product of these counts is accumulated in `res`, giving the total probability of no inversions.
   - **Modular Inverses:** The final step involves multiplying `res` by the modular inverses of the ranges for each problem, ensuring the final result is in the correct form.

5. **Annotations and Correctness:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after each function call.
   - The logic in the code aligns with the problem requirements, ensuring that the number of accepted solutions for each problem is at least as high as the minimum for any subsequent problem.
   - The use of modular arithmetic functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) is appropriate for handling large numbers within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the probability of no inversions in the problem order. It uses the necessary modular arithmetic functions to handle large numbers and follows the required steps to ensure the probability calculation is accurate.
