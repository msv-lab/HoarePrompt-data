Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program only contains helper functions for modular multiplication and exponentiation, but it does not contain the main logic to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.

To verify this, let's consider the problem requirements:

1. The program needs to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
2. For each problem \(i\), the number of accepted solutions \(a_i\) is uniformly distributed between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).
3. An inversion occurs if \(x < y\) and \(a_y > a_x\).

The provided program lacks the logic to simulate or calculate the probability of no inversions. It simply defines three helper functions for modular arithmetic operations but does not compute the required probability.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus incorrect.
