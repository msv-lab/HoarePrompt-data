Precondition: **a is an integer and 1 â‰¤ a < 998244353.** 

Explanation: The function `func_3` computes the modular inverse of `a` with respect to `MOD` (which is `998244353`). The input `a` must be an integer within the range `[1, 998244352]`, as it is being raised to the power of `MOD - 2` to compute its modular inverse.
