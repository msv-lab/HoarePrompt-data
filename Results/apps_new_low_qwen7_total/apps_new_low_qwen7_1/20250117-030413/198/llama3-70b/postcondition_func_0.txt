The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b < 998244353\). It returns the result of \((a \times b) \% 998244353\). The function performs the multiplication of `a` and `b` and then takes the modulus with respect to \(998244353\). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, and the provided return postcondition accurately reflects the intended behavior of the function.
