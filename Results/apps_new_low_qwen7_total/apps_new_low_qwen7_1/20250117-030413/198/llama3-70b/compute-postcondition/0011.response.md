The code `res = func_1(res, a)` updates the value of `res` by calling the function `func_1` with `res` and `a` as arguments. However, the initial value of `res` is determined by whether `b` was even or odd after the right shift operation.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`
- `b` is greater than 0 after right shift by 1
- `res` remains unchanged if `b` was even before the right shift and `res` is the result of `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)` if `b` was odd before the right shift

Since `b` is greater than 0 after the right shift by 1, we don't know the exact initial value of `b`, but we know its right shift results in a positive number. This implies `b` could be any positive number after the shift, but the parity (even or odd) determines the next value of `res`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `b` was even before the right shift, `res` remains unchanged.
2. If `b` was odd before the right shift, `res` becomes `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`.

Since the exact value of `b` before the shift is not specified, we need to keep the condition based on the parity of `b` after the shift.

After executing the line `res = func_1(res, a)`, the new value of `res` will depend on the initial value of `res`:
- If `b` was even, `res` remains `func_1(a, a)`.
- If `b` was odd, `res` becomes `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`
- `b` is greater than 0 after right shift by 1
- `res` is `func_1(a, a)` if `b` was even before the right shift, otherwise `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`

Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` is greater than 0 after right shift by 1, `res` is `func_1(a, a)` if `b` was even before the right shift, otherwise `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`**
