Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the problem:

### Initial State:
- `a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`.
- `b` is greater than 0 after a right shift by 1 (`b >>= 1`).
- `res` is `func_1(a, a)` if `b` was even before the right shift, otherwise `res` is `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```
a = func_1(a, a)
b >>= 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Line: `a = func_1(a, a)`**
   - This line updates `a` to the result of calling `func_1(a, a)`. However, since `a` is already the result of `func_1(a, a)` from the initial state, this line effectively reassigns `a` to itself, which means `a` remains unchanged.

2. **Second Line: `b >>= 1`**
   - This line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b` by 1. It divides `b` by 2, discarding the remainder. Since `b` was greater than 0 after the right shift in the initial state, it will now be half of its previous value (and still positive).

### Final State:
- `a` remains unchanged, so `a` is still the result of `func_1(a, a)`.
- `b` is now half of its initial value after the right shift.
- `res` is not affected by the code snippet, so it retains its initial value based on the condition specified in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The only change made by the code is to halve the value of `b`.

### Output State:
**Output State: a is the result of func_1(a, a), b is half of its initial value, res is func_1(a, a) if b was even before the right shift, otherwise res is func_1(func_1(a, a), a)**
