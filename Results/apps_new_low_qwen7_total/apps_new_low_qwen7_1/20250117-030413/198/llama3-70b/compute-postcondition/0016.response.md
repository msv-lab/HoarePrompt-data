The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, with \( b \neq 0 \). The function returns `res`, which is the result of repeatedly applying `func_1(a, a)` until it is applied the same number of times as the final value of `b` (if `b` was odd, one additional application of `func_1(a, a)` compared to when `b` is even).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with \( b \neq 0 \), and return the result of repeatedly applying `func_1(a, a)` the appropriate number of times based on the value of `b`.
