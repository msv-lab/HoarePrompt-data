The initial state is given as `a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, and `b` must be greater than 0. The code snippet sets `res` to the result of calling `func_1(res, a)`.

Since the initial value of `a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, and `res` is set to the result of `func_1(res, a)`, we know that `res` now holds the value of `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`. However, without knowing the exact definition of `func_1`, we cannot simplify this further in terms of a specific numerical value. But we can still state the updated value of `res`.

The variable `b` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the given code snippet. 

Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` must be greater than 0, `res` is the result of `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)`**
