To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, specifically `b`.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `b > 0`.
2. **Given State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is greater than 0 after a right shift by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. A right shift operation (`b >> 1`) divides the value of `b` by 2 (ignoring the remainder). Therefore, if `b` was greater than 0 after the right shift, it must be at least 1 before the shift to satisfy the condition `b > 0` after the shift.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- The initial value of `b` must have been at least 2 before the right shift, so after the right shift, `b` will be at least 1.
- Since the loop condition is `b > 0`, `b` must be greater than 0 after the right shift.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0 after the right shift.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` is greater than 0 after right shift by 1, `res` remains unchanged if `b` was even before the right shift and `res` is the result of `func_1(func_1(a, a), a)` if `b` was odd before the right shift, `b` must be greater than 0 after the right shift**
