Output State: **a is the result of func_1(a, a), b is greater than 0 after right shift by 1, res is the result of func_1(func_1(a, a), a) if b was odd before the right shift, res remains unchanged if b was even before the right shift**

Explanation:
1. The first line `a = func_1(a, a)` updates the value of `a` to the result of calling `func_1` with `a` as both arguments.
2. The second line `b >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b` by 1 bit. This does not change the truth value of `b > 0` (i.e., whether `b` is greater than 0) but reduces its value by half. The value of `b` after this operation is no longer explicitly defined in terms of its original value; it is simply that it has been halved and remains greater than 0 if it originally was.

Given these operations, we maintain the updated `a` and the condition for `b` being greater than 0 after the right shift. The variable `res` is not directly affected by the second line and remains as it was, depending on the value of `b` before the right shift. If `b` was odd, `res` would have been calculated; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
