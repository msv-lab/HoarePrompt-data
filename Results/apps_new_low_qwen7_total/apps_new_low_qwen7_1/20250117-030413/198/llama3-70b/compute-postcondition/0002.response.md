Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts an integer `a` such that 1 â‰¤ a < 998244353. It then calls another function `func_2` with the arguments `a` and `MOD - 2`, where `MOD` is defined as 998244353. The function returns the result of `func_2(a, 998244351)`. The potential edge case to consider is when `a` is exactly 1 or when `a` is equal to `MOD - 1`, as these values might have specific implications depending on the implementation of `func_2`. There is no missing functionality indicated in the provided code; however, without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact nature of the operation performed by `func_2(a, 998244351)`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable holding the return value of `func_3` contains the result of `func_2(a, 998244351)`.**
