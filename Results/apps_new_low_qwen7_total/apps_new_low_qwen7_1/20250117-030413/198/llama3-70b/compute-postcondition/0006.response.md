The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the result of `b` being right-shifted by 1 bit. Right-shifting a number by 1 bit is equivalent to dividing it by 2, so for `b` to be greater than 0 after this operation, it must have been greater than 0 before the shift.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` must be greater than 0 before the right-shift operation.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(a, a)`, `b` must be greater than 0**
