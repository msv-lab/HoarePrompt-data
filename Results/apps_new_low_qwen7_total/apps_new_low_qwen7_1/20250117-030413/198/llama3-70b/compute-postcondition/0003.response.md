`res` is assigned the value of `func_1(res, a)`. The initial value of `res` is 1, and `a` is a non-negative integer. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so we cannot determine the exact value of `res` after calling `func_1(res, a)`. We only know that `res` will now hold the result of the function call.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer with \( b \neq 0 \), `res` is the result of `func_1(1, a)` and the current value of `b` is odd.**
