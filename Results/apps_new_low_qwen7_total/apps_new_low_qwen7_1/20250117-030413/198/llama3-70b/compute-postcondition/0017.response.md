Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers and `b` is not zero. It returns `res`, which is the result of repeatedly applying `func_1(a, a)` the appropriate number of times based on the value of `b`. Specifically, `func_1(a, a)` is applied `b` times if `b` is even, and `b + 1` times if `b` is odd. The function achieves this through a loop that halves `b` in each iteration and applies `func_1(a, a)` to `a` if `b` is odd. The variable `res` accumulates the result of these applications.**

This summary includes the core functionality described by the code and annotations, as well as any implicit assumptions about the behavior when `b` is even or odd. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the provided code or annotations, but the summary covers the typical case where `b` is a positive integer.
