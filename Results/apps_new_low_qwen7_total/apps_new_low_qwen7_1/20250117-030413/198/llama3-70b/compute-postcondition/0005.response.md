Output State: **a is the result of func_1(a, a), b is b right-shifted by 1 bit**

Explanation:
- The first line `a = func_1(a, a)` updates the value of `a` to the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `a` and `a`.
- The second line `b >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b` by 1 bit. This means `b` is divided by 2 and the result is stored back in `b`.

Since the initial state of `a` is a non-negative integer and `b` is a non-negative integer with \( b \neq 0 \), these operations will update `a` and `b` accordingly, maintaining their non-negative nature with `b` being halved (rounded down if necessary). The variable `res` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the given code block.
