Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly identifies if the initial set of tiles forms a koutsu or shuntsu. If so, it returns 0.
   - If not, it calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form a koutsu or shuntsu by iterating over the suits and calling `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)`.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`:**
   - This function correctly identifies if the input tiles form a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles in the same suit).
   - However, there is a potential issue with the condition for identifying a shuntsu. The condition `sorted([n1, n2, n3]) in ([n1, n2, n3] for n1 in range(1, 8))` might not work as intended because it doesn't actually check if the sequence is sequential within the range 1 to 9. Instead, it should directly check the difference between the numbers.

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the number of additional tiles needed to form a complete group of three identical tiles.
   - The logic for determining the number of additional tiles based on the length of the input list and the difference between the numbers is correct.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:
- **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`:**
  - The current implementation might incorrectly identify a shuntsu. For example, it should directly check if the numbers form a sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3 or 7, 8, 9), not just if the sorted sequence is in a specific range.
  - A corrected version of the shuntsu check would be:
    ```python
    if (s1 == s2 == s3 and sorted([n1, n2, n3]) == [n1, n1+1, n1+2]):
        return True
    ```

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issue with the `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` function, the overall logic of the program is correct. The `func_1` function correctly handles the initial check for a koutsu or shuntsu and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed if necessary.

Given that the primary functionality (checking for koutsu/shuntsu and calculating the minimum additional tiles) is correctly implemented, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
