Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

# Annotated Functions:

input = sys.stdin.read
tiles = input().strip()
print(func_1(tiles))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tiles is a list of three strings, where each string represents a suited tile in the format "digit suit" (e.g., "1m", "2p", "3s"). The digits range from 1 to 9, and the suits can be m, p, or s.
def func_1(tiles):
    t1, t2, t3 = tiles.split()
    if is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `tiles` is a list of three strings, where each string represents a suited tile in the format "digit suit"; `t1` is one of the strings from `tiles`, `t2` is another string from `tiles`, and `t3` is the last string from `tiles`. The condition `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)` is false.
    suits = {'m': [], 'p': [], 's': []}
    for tile in [t1, t2, t3]:
        suits[tile[1]].append(int(tile[0]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `tiles` is a list of three strings `[t1, t2, t3]`, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)` is false, and `suits[tile[1]]` is `[val1, val2, val3]`, where `val1`, `val2`, and `val3` are the integer values of the first characters of `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` respectively.
    min_additional_tiles = 2
    for (suit, numbers) in suits.items():
        min_additional_tiles = min(min_additional_tiles,
            tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `tiles` is a list of three strings `[t1, t2, t3]`, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)` is false, `suits` is unchanged, and `min_additional_tiles` is the minimum value among the results of `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` for all key-value pairs in `suits`.
    return min_additional_tiles
    #The program returns min_additional_tiles which is the minimum value among the results of tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers) for all key-value pairs in suits
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of three strings `tiles`, where each string represents a suited tile in the format "digit suit" (e.g., "1m", "2p", "3s"). The digits range from 1 to 9, and the suits can be m, p, or s. The function determines whether the given tiles form a koutsu (three identical tiles) or shuntsu (a sequence of three consecutive tiles). If they do, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete groups for each suit and returns this minimum value.

After the function concludes, the following will be true:
- If the given tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu, the function returns 0.
- If the given tiles do not form a koutsu or shuntsu, the function returns `min_additional_tiles`, which is the smallest number of additional tiles required to complete groups for each suit. This value is determined by iterating over the suits and calculating the necessary additional tiles using the `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` function for each suit.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t1, t2, and t3 are strings representing suited tiles where the first character is a digit from 1 to 9 and the second character is 'm', 'p', or 's'.
def is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):
    if (t1 == t2 == t3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: t1, t2, and t3 are strings representing suited tiles where the first character is a digit from 1 to 9 and the second character is 'm', 'p', or 's'. The strings t1, t2, and t3 are not all equal.
    n1, s1 = int(t1[0]), t1[1]

n2, s2 = int(t2[0]), t2[1]

n3, s3 = int(t3[0]), t3[1]
    if (s1 == s2 == s3 and sorted([n1, n2, n3]) in ([n1, n2, n3] for n1 in range(1,
    8))) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: t1 is a string with a digit and a suit, t2 is a string with a digit and a suit, t3 is a string with a digit and a suit, n1 is an integer, n2 is an integer, n3 is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, s3 is a string, and it is not the case that s1 == s2 == s3 and sorted([n1, n2, n3]) in ([n1, n2, n3] for n1 in range(1, 8))
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` accepts three parameters: `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`. Each parameter is a string representing a suited tile where the first character is a digit from 1 to 9 and the second character is 'm', 'p', or 's'. The function checks if the input strings represent either a koutsu (a triplet of the same number) or a shuntsu (a sequential triplet of the same suit).

After executing the function, the following states will be true:
- If the input strings represent a koutsu, the function returns `True`.
- If the input strings represent a shuntsu, the function returns `True`.
- If the input strings do not represent either a koutsu or a shuntsu, the function returns `False`.

The function correctly identifies koutsu and shuntsu based on the conditions specified in the code. It first checks if all three input strings are identical, which would indicate a koutsu. If not, it then checks if the numbers in the strings form a sequential triplet and if the suits are the same, which would indicate a shuntsu. If neither condition is met, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The code currently does not handle cases where the input strings do not follow the expected format (e.g., incorrect characters or out-of-range digits). This could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided.
- The code assumes that the suits are checked and considered in both conditions, but it does not explicitly state or check that the suits are the same in the shuntsu condition. While the annotation mentions checking suits, the code itself does not enforce this check, potentially leading to false positives if the suits are not verified.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tiles is a list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The list is not necessarily sorted.
def tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles):
    tiles.sort()
    if (len(tiles) == 1) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `tiles` is a sorted list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The length of `tiles` is more than 1.
    if (len(tiles) == 2) :
        if (tiles[0] == tiles[1]) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `tiles` is a sorted list of 2 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The length of `tiles` is exactly 2, and the two strings in the list are not equal.
        if (tiles[1] - tiles[0] <= 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `tiles` is a sorted list of 2 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The length of `tiles` is exactly 2, and the two strings in the list are not equal. The difference between the second string and the first string in `tiles` is greater than 2.
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `tiles` is a sorted list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The length of `tiles` is more than 2.
    return 2
    #The program returns 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The list is not necessarily sorted. After sorting the list, the function determines the number of additional tiles needed to form a complete group of three identical tiles.

- If the length of the list is 1, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 2, the function checks if the two tiles are the same. If they are, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. If they are different, it further checks if the difference between the digits of the two tiles is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 3, the function always returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
