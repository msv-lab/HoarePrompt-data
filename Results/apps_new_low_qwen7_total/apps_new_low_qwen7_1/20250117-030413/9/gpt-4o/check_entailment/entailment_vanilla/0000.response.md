Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze each function step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It splits the input string into three tiles.
   - It checks if there is already a koutsu or shuntsu among the tiles. If so, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it categorizes the tiles by their suits and counts how many additional tiles are needed to complete a group in each suit.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**:
   - This function checks if the three tiles form a koutsu (triplet).
   - It also checks if they form a shuntsu (sequence) by sorting the numbers and verifying if they are consecutive within the same suit.

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**:
   - This function determines the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group.
     - If there is only one tile, it needs two more.
     - If there are two tiles and they are the same, it needs one more.
     - If there are two tiles and they are not the same, it checks if they can form a sequence with one more tile.
     - If there are three tiles, it always returns 2, as a minimum of two more tiles might be needed to complete a sequence.

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `1s 2s 3s`
  - No koutsu or shuntsu, so we need to check the suits.
  - Both 's' suits have three consecutive tiles (1s, 2s, 3s), so no additional tiles are needed.
  - The program correctly outputs 0.

- **Example 2**: `9m 9m 9m`
  - Already has a koutsu (9m, 9m, 9m), so no additional tiles are needed.
  - The program correctly outputs 0.

- **Example 3**: `3p 9m 2p`
  - No koutsu or shuntsu, so we need to check the suits.
  - 'p' suit needs one more tile (either 1p or 4p) to form a shuntsu.
  - The program correctly outputs 1.

The program seems to handle all edge cases and follows the rules correctly. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
