Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles needed to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function checks if the three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu. It correctly identifies whether all three tiles are the same (koutsu) or if they form a sequence in the same suit (shuntsu).

2. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function calculates how many additional tiles are needed to complete a group of tiles into a koutsu or a shuntsu. It handles different scenarios correctly:
   - If the group has one tile, it needs two more to form a koutsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they are the same, it needs one more to form a koutsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they form a sequence, it needs one more to complete the shuntsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they do not form a sequence, it needs two more to form a koutsu.

3. **Main Function `func_1`**: This function uses the above helper functions to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed. It splits the input tiles, checks for immediate mentsu formation, and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles required if no mentsu is found initially.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly handles all cases. It accounts for the formation of both koutsu and shuntsu, and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed accurately. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the given requirements and examples.
