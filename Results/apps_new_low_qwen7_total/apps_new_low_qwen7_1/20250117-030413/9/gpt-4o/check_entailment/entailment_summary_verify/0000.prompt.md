You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(tiles):
    (t1, t2, t3) = tiles.split()

    if is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):
        return 0
    suits = {'m': [], 'p': [], 's': []}
    for tile in [t1, t2, t3]:
        suits[tile[1]].append(int(tile[0]))

    min_additional_tiles = 2
    for (suit, numbers) in suits.items():
        min_additional_tiles = min(min_additional_tiles, tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers))
    return min_additional_tiles

#Function 2:
def is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3):
    if t1 == t2 == t3:
        return True
    (n1, s1) = (int(t1[0]), t1[1])
    (n2, s2) = (int(t2[0]), t2[1])
    (n3, s3) = (int(t3[0]), t3[1])

        return True
    return False

#Function 3:
def tiles_needed_to_complete_group(tiles):
    tiles.sort()
    if len(tiles) == 1:
        return 2
    if len(tiles) == 2:
        if tiles[0] == tiles[1]:
            return 1
        if tiles[1] - tiles[0] <= 2:

    return 2



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The list is not necessarily sorted. After sorting the list, the function determines the number of additional tiles needed to form a complete group of three identical tiles.

- If the length of the list is 1, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 2, the function checks if the two tiles are the same. If they are, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. If they are different, it further checks if the difference between the digits of the two tiles is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 3, the function always returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles needed to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). Here’s why:

1. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function checks if the three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu. It correctly identifies whether all three tiles are the same (koutsu) or if they form a sequence in the same suit (shuntsu).

2. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function calculates how many additional tiles are needed to complete a group of tiles into a koutsu or a shuntsu. It handles different scenarios correctly:
   - If the group has one tile, it needs two more to form a koutsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they are the same, it needs one more to form a koutsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they form a sequence, it needs one more to complete the shuntsu.
   - If the group has two tiles and they do not form a sequence, it needs two more to form a koutsu.

3. **Main Function `func_1`**: This function uses the above helper functions to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed. It splits the input tiles, checks for immediate mentsu formation, and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles required if no mentsu is found initially.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly handles all cases. It accounts for the formation of both koutsu and shuntsu, and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed accurately. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the given requirements and examples.
