The `sort()` method is called on the `tiles` list, which sorts the list in ascending order based on the lexicographical order of the strings. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in the list, we can denote them as `tile1`, `tile2`, and `tile3` where each is a string consisting of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character.

After sorting, the list will be in ascending order. The output state will reflect this sorted list. The exact values of the tiles cannot be determined without more information, but the list will be sorted.

Output State: **`tiles` is a sorted list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character.**
