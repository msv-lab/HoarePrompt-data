Postcondition: `tiles` is a sorted list of 2 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The length of `tiles` is exactly 2, and the two strings in the list are not equal. The difference between the second string and the first string in `tiles` is greater than 2.
