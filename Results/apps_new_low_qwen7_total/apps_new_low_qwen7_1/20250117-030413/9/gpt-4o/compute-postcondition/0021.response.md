The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tiles`. `tiles` is a list of three strings, where each string represents a suited tile in the format "digit suit" (e.g., "1m", "2p", "3s"). The digits range from 1 to 9, and the suits can be m, p, or s.

The function has two cases:
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns `min_additional_tiles`, which is the minimum value among the results of `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` for all key-value pairs in suits.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of three strings representing tiles and return either 0 or the minimum value of additional tiles needed to complete groups based on the suits.
