Functionality: **The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list of 3 strings, where each string represents a suited tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. Each string consists of a digit from '1' to '9' and a lowercase letter ('m', 'p', or 's') as its second character. The list is not necessarily sorted. After sorting the list, the function determines the number of additional tiles needed to form a complete group of three identical tiles.

- If the length of the list is 1, the function returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 2, the function checks if the two tiles are the same. If they are, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. If they are different, it further checks if the difference between the digits of the two tiles is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns 1, indicating that 1 more tile is needed. Otherwise, it returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.
- If the length of the list is 3, the function always returns 2, indicating that 2 more tiles are needed.**

This covers all potential cases and includes the necessary edge cases.
