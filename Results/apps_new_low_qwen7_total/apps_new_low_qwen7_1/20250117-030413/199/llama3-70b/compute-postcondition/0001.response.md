To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the conditions necessary for the loop to start.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `ways` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Function in Python**:
   - The `range(start, stop)` function generates numbers starting from `start` up to but not including `stop`.
   - In this case, `range(1, n // 2 + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n // 2`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the `start` value (which is 1) is less than the `stop` value (`n // 2 + 1`).

3. **Initial Values**:
   - Initially, `a` is not defined and will be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `1 < n // 2 + 1` must be true.

4. **Ensuring the Condition**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to verify that `n // 2 + 1` is greater than 1.
   - Simplifying this, \(n // 2 + 1 > 1\) simplifies to \(n // 2 > 0\), which means \(n > 0\). Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer (\(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\)), this condition is inherently satisfied.

5. **State Before the First Iteration**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, and since `a` is initialized to 1, the condition is met for the first iteration.

### Conclusion:

The only variable in the loop head is `a`, which is initialized to 1. The loop can execute the first time if the loop body is valid and `a` is within the range specified. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop can start and `a` will be set to 1.

### Final State:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1**
