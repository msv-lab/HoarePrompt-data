Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is:
- `total` = 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` = 1

The loop iterates over `b` in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1
```

#### 2. Track Variable Changes
- `total`: This variable is not used in the loop and remains 0.
- `a`: The value of `a` remains constant throughout the loop and is always 1.
- `b`: The loop updates `b` within its defined range but does not assign a new value to it; instead, it checks conditions and updates `ways`.
- `ways`: This variable increments by 1 each time the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied.

#### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will execute for each `b` in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
- Since `a` is always 1, the range for `b` simplifies to `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)`.
- The loop checks if `2 * (a + b) == n` and if `a != b`. If both conditions are met, `ways` is incremented by 1.

#### 4. Verify Relationships
- After the loop completes, `total` remains 0 because it is not used in the loop.
- `a` remains 1 because it is not modified.
- `ways` will be incremented by 1 each time the condition `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b` is satisfied.

### Output State Calculation

To find the final value of `ways`:
- We need to check for each `b` in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)` whether `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`.

For example, if `n = 6`:
- The range for `b` is `[1, (6 - 1) // 2 + 1) = [1, 3)`, so `b` can be 2.
- For `b = 2`, `2 * (1 + 2) == 6` and `1 != 2`, so `ways` will be incremented by 1.

If `n = 7`:
- The range for `b` is `[1, (7 - 1) // 2 + 1) = [1, 4)`, so `b` can be 2 or 3.
- For `b = 2`, `2 * (1 + 2) == 6 ≠ 7`, so no increment.
- For `b = 3`, `2 * (1 + 3) == 8 ≠ 7`, so no increment.
- Therefore, `ways` remains 0.

In general, `ways` will be incremented by 1 for each valid `b` in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)` where `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`.

### Final Output State
The final output state after the loop has executed is:
- `total` is still 0.
- `n` is still a positive integer.
- `a` is still 1.
- `ways` will be the count of valid `b` values that satisfy the condition `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`.**
