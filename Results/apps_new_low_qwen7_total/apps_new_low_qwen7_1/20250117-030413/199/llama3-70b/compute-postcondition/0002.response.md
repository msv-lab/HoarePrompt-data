To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop starts. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `a` is 1

2. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
   - For the loop to start executing, the range must be non-empty, meaning there must be at least one value in the range.

3. **Range Condition**:
   - The range is defined as `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the starting value (`a`) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`(n - a) // 2 + 1`).

4. **Evaluating the Range**:
   - Given `a = 1`, the condition simplifies to checking if `1 <= (n - 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - This further simplifies to `1 <= (n - 1) / 2 + 1`, which is `1 <= (n + 1) / 2`.

5. **Solving the Inequality**:
   - To ensure the range is non-empty, `(n + 1) / 2` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Simplifying this, we get `n + 1 >= 2`, which means `n >= 1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, it inherently satisfies `n >= 1`.
   - Therefore, the only additional requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that the range is non-empty.

### Final State

Given that the range must be non-empty, the initial values provided are sufficient. No additional adjustments are needed for the given initial conditions.

**State:**
- `total` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer (satisfies `n >= 1`)
- `a` is 1
- `b` must be in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1]` for the loop to execute the first time.

So, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `b` must be in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1]`**.
