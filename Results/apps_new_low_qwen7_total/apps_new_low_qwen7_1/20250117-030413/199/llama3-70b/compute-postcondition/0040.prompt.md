You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over values of `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`. For each `a`, it then iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. The loop increments `ways` if the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` are satisfied.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `total` remains constant at 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #   - `n` is assumed to be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4 and remains unchanged.
    #   - `a` changes in the outer loop from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #   - `b` changes in the inner loop from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - `ways` is incremented based on the conditions met in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
    #   - The outer loop runs for each value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #   - The inner loop runs for each value of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - `ways` is incremented if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
    #   - The loop will stop once `a` reaches `n // 2 + 1`, at which point `b` will exceed `(n - a) // 2`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: 
    #   - When `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, the inner loop will not execute because `b` starts from `a` and `b` cannot be greater than or equal to `a` while also being within the range `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - Therefore, `ways` will be incremented only if there exists a valid `b` within the range for any value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #
    #Since the loop does not execute for `a = n // 2 + 1`, `ways` will remain 0 if no valid `b` was found in previous iterations. Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.
    return ways
    #`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is n // 2 + 1, `ways` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, sets `total` to 0, calculates `a` as `n // 2 + 1`, initializes `ways` to 0, and does not explicitly return any values.

```

Return Postconditions: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is n // 2 + 1, `ways` is 0


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
