`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, and `b` is in the range `[1, (n - 2) // 2 + 1]`. After executing the code, the value of `ways` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `b` is in the range `[1, (n - 2) // 2 + 1]`, `ways` is 1**
