Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `a` is 2
   - `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\)

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` (which is 2) up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - For the loop to start, the range function must provide at least one value for `b`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop)` will produce a sequence of numbers starting from `start` and ending at `stop` (exclusive).
   - In this case, the start of the range is `a`, which is 2.
   - The stop of the range is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

5. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if there exists at least one `b` in the range `[2, (n - 2) // 2 + 1]` such that \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\).

6. **Ensuring the Range is Valid:**
   - To ensure that the loop can start, `(n - 2) // 2 + 1` must be at least 2 (since the start of the range is 2).
   - This implies that \((n - 2) // 2 + 1 \geq 2\).
   - Simplifying, we get \((n - 2) // 2 \geq 1\), which further simplifies to \(n - 2 \geq 2\), hence \(n \geq 4\).

7. **Validating the Condition \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\):**
   - The condition \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) simplifies to \(2 + 2b == n\) or \(2b == n - 2\) or \(b == (n - 2) / 2\).
   - For `b` to be an integer, \(n - 2\) must be even, which means \(n\) must be even.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 4 and even.
   - Additionally, the value of `b` must be within the range `[2, (n - 2) // 2 + 1]` and satisfy \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\).

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time should be:

**State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\)**
