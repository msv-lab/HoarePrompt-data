The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial condition states that `ways` is incremented if \(2 \times (2 + 3) == n\). Let's evaluate this condition first:

- \(2 \times (2 + 3) = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Given that `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, and the condition for incrementing `ways` is specifically when \(n == 10\), `ways` will be incremented by 1 only if \(n\) is 10.

Since the problem does not specify that \(n\) is exactly 10, we consider the general case where `ways` is incremented by 1 if \(n\) is 10. If \(n\) is not 10, `ways` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `ways` is 1 if \(n\) is 10, and 0 otherwise. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is 1 if `n` is 10, else 0.**
