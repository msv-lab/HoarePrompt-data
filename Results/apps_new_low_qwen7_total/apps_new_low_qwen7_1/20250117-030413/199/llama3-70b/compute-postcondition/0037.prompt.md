Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9; `ways` is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
        if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
            ways += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. For each `b`, it checks if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`. If both conditions are met, it increments `ways`.
   
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `total` remains constant at 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `a` remains constant at 2 as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` is assumed to be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `ways` changes based on the loop condition and incrementation.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
   - The loop will execute for each `b` in the specified range.
   - `ways` is incremented by 1 for each valid `b` that satisfies the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
   - The loop will stop once `b` exceeds `(n - a) // 2`.

4. **Verify Relationships**: 
   - Since `a` is fixed at 2, the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` simplifies to `2 * (2 + b) == n` or `2 + b == n / 2`.
   - This means `b` must be `n / 2 - 2` for the condition to be true.
   - Additionally, `b` must not be equal to `a`, which is 2.
   - Therefore, `ways` will be 1 if `n / 2 - 2` is a valid integer and not equal to 2, otherwise `ways` will remain 0.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes is:
Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: total = 0, n is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, a = n // 2 + 1, ways = 0.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
