Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over values of `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`. For each `a`, it then iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. The loop increments `ways` if the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` are satisfied.

2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `total` remains constant at 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` is assumed to be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4 and remains unchanged.
   - `a` changes in the outer loop from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - `b` changes in the inner loop from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - `ways` is incremented based on the conditions met in the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
   - The outer loop runs for each value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop runs for each value of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - `ways` is incremented if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
   - The loop will stop once `a` reaches `n // 2 + 1`, at which point `b` will exceed `(n - a) // 2`.

4. **Verify Relationships**: 
   - When `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, the inner loop will not execute because `b` starts from `a` and `b` cannot be greater than or equal to `a` while also being within the range `(n - a) // 2`.
   - Therefore, `ways` will be incremented only if there exists a valid `b` within the range for any value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.

Since the loop does not execute for `a = n // 2 + 1`, `ways` will remain 0 if no valid `b` was found in previous iterations. Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.
