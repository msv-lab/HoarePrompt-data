The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. According to the initial state, `ways` is increased by 1 if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. However, since `a` is 3 and `b` is 5, the condition `a != b` is true, and the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` simplifies to `2 * (3 + 5) == n`, which is `16 == n`. Given that `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, this condition will be true for `n = 16`.

Since the conditions are met, `ways` is incremented by 1. The output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 5, the upper limit of the range for `b` is \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\), and `ways` is 1.**
