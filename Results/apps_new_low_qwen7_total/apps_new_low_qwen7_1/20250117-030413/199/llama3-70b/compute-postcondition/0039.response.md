The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9. The function sets `total` to 0, calculates `a` as `n // 2 + 1`, and initializes `ways` to 0. Based on the given output conditions, the function does not explicitly return any values from within its body but rather updates local variables. However, following the given structure, we can describe the return value as the final state of these variables.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, sets `total` to 0, calculates `a` as `n // 2 + 1`, initializes `ways` to 0, and does not explicitly return any values.**
