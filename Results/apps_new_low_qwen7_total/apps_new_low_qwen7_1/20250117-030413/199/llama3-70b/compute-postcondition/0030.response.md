Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined by `b` in the range `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 3.
   - `b` starts from 3, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - `ways` is initially unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is within the specified range. The loop body will check if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. If this condition is met, `ways` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state after one iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 3.
   - `b` is the current value being iterated over, starting from 3 up to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `b` starts from 3, the first iteration will set `b` to 3.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `b` will increment by 1 (since the loop increments `b` by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, in the next iteration, `b` will be 4.
   - `a` remains 3 because it does not change within the loop.
   - The upper limit of the range for `b` remains `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`.

Given the above steps, we can conclude the new state before the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` remains unchanged.**
