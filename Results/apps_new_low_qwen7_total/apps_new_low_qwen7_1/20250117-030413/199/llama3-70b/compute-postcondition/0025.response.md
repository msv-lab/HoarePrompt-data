Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head Variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `a` and `n`.

2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4
   - `a` is 2
   - `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - In the previous iteration, `a` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `a` will be incremented by 1, making `a` equal to 3.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `total` remains unchanged and still is 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is now 3.
   - `ways` is updated based on the new value of `a`.

5. **New State**:
   - The new value of `a` is 3.
   - `n` remains a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `ways` is recalculated based on the new `a` value.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.**
