`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4. The value of `a` remains 2. The value of `b` is updated to `b_prev + 1`. The initial state's conditions about `total` being 0 are also still valid.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `ways` is increased by 1**
