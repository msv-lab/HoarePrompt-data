The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. The value of `ways` was initially 0, so now it becomes 1. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and the current value of `b` satisfies the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n`; `ways` is 1.**
