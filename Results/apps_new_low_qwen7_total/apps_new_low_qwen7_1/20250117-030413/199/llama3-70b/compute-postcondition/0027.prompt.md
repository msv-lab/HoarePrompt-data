You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's analyze the given problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop is defined as follows:
     ```python
     for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
     ```
   - The variables in the loop head are `a`, `b`, and `n`.

2. **Initial State Before the First Iteration of the Outer Loop**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 3 (as determined from the previous iteration).

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - In the previous iteration, `a` was 2.
   - Now, `a` is 3.
   - We need to find the initial state that allows the inner loop to start executing.

4. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Inner Loop**:
   - For the inner loop to start executing, `a` must be a valid starting point for the range.
   - The condition `b` should start from `a` and go up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

### Adjusting the States

- **`total`**: Remains unchanged and is still 0.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged and is still a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
- **`a`**: Is now 3.
- **`ways`**: Not directly relevant to the initial state of the inner loop but will be updated based on the new value of `a`.

### New State for the Inner Loop

For the inner loop to start executing the first time, the following conditions must hold true:

- `a` must be 3.
- `n` must be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
- `b` should start from `a`, which means `b` should start from 3.
- The upper limit of the range for `b` should be `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the inner loop is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.**

So, the final state is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`.**
if condition:
```
if (a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
