Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `total` is 0
- `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4
- `a` is 2
- `ways` is 1 if `2 * (2 + b) == n` and `b` satisfies `a != b`, else `ways` remains 0

### For Loop
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `b`, `a`, and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is within the range `[a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was one less than its current upper bound `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

### Adjusting States
- **Variable `b`**: `b` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- **Variable `a`**: `a` remains constant at 2 throughout the loop.
- **Variable `n`**: `n` remains unchanged since it is defined before the loop and does not change during the loop iterations.

### Calculation
- Letâ€™s denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `b_prev`.
- Since the loop continues until `b` reaches `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration will be `b_prev + 1`.

### Updated State
- `total` remains 0.
- `a` remains 2.
- `n` remains the same.
- `b` becomes `b_prev + 1`.

To find the exact value of `b`, we need to know the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration. However, without this specific value, we can express the state in terms of the previous value of `b`.

### Final Answer
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `b` is `b_prev + 1`**. 

Note: Replace `b_prev` with the actual value of `b` from the previous iteration.
