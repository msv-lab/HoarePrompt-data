Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and if the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied, then `ways` is 1. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.**
