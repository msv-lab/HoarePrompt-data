Let's analyze the given problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop is defined as follows:
     ```python
     for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
     ```
   - The variables in the loop head are `a`, `b`, and `n`.

2. **Initial State Before the First Iteration of the Outer Loop**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 3 (as determined from the previous iteration).

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - In the previous iteration, `a` was 2.
   - Now, `a` is 3.
   - We need to find the initial state that allows the inner loop to start executing.

4. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Inner Loop**:
   - For the inner loop to start executing, `a` must be a valid starting point for the range.
   - The condition `b` should start from `a` and go up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

### Adjusting the States

- **`total`**: Remains unchanged and is still 0.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged and is still a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
- **`a`**: Is now 3.
- **`ways`**: Not directly relevant to the initial state of the inner loop but will be updated based on the new value of `a`.

### New State for the Inner Loop

For the inner loop to start executing the first time, the following conditions must hold true:

- `a` must be 3.
- `n` must be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
- `b` should start from `a`, which means `b` should start from 3.
- The upper limit of the range for `b` should be `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the inner loop is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.**

So, the final state is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`.**
