Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head Variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `a` and `n`.

2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4
   - `a` is 2
   - `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - In the previous iteration, `a` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `a` will be incremented by 1, making `a` equal to 3.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `total` remains unchanged and still is 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is now 3.
   - `ways` is updated based on the new value of `a`.

5. **New State**:
   - The new value of `a` is 3.
   - `n` remains a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `ways` is recalculated based on the new `a` value.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.**
Code of the loop:
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` starts from 3, the upper limit of the range for `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and if the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied, then `ways` is 1. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, the upper limit of the range for `b` is \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\), and `ways` is increased by 1 if \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\). Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 5, the upper limit of the range for `b` is \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\), and `ways` is 1. If `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), `ways` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
