Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) and \(1 \neq b\), and `ways` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `b` is different from `a` and satisfies \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).**
