`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `total` remains 0, `n` remains a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` remains 3, `b` remains 4, and the upper limit of the range for `b` is still \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\). Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, the upper limit of the range for `b` is \((n - 3) // 2 + 1\), and `ways` is increased by 1.
