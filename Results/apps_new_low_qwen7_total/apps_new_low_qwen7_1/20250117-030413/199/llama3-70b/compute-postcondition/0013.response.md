Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop in question is:
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The only variables involved in this loop are `a` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `a` is 1
   - `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `a = 1` and increments `a` by 1 each time until `a` reaches `n // 2 + 1`.
   - For the next iteration to occur, `a` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 1. To proceed to the next iteration, `a` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `a = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not being modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `a` is now 2.
   - `ways` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values such that `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `1 != b`**
