Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. For each `b`, it checks if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`. If both conditions are met, it increments `ways`.
   
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `total` remains constant at 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `a` remains constant at 2 as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` is assumed to be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `ways` changes based on the loop condition and incrementation.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
   - The loop will execute for each `b` in the specified range.
   - `ways` is incremented by 1 for each valid `b` that satisfies the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
   - The loop will stop once `b` exceeds `(n - a) // 2`.

4. **Verify Relationships**: 
   - Since `a` is fixed at 2, the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` simplifies to `2 * (2 + b) == n` or `2 + b == n / 2`.
   - This means `b` must be `n / 2 - 2` for the condition to be true.
   - Additionally, `b` must not be equal to `a`, which is 2.
   - Therefore, `ways` will be 1 if `n / 2 - 2` is a valid integer and not equal to 2, otherwise `ways` will remain 0.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes is:
Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the count of valid `b` values in the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
