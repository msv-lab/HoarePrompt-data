`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `ways` was previously 1 if the conditions `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` were met, otherwise it was 0. Now, `ways` is increased by 1, so the updated condition for `ways` is the same as before but incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`total`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `b` is `(n - 2) // 2 + 2`, `ways` is 2 if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` is true, otherwise `ways` is 1.**
