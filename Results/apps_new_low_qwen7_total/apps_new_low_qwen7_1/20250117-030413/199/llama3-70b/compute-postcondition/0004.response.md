`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `total` remains 0, `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains 1, and `b` remains in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1]` with the condition that `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is 1, `b` is in the range `[1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1]`, `ways` is 1, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.**
