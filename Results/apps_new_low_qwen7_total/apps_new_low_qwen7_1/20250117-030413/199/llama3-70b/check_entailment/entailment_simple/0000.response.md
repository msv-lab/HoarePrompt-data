Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting the number of ways to divide a stick of length \( n \) into four parts such that those parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
- The annotated program correctly identifies this requirement through its nested loops. The outer loop iterates over possible values for \( a \), and the inner loop iterates over possible values for \( b \).
- The conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` ensure that the four parts can form a rectangle (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal) but not a square (since all sides of a square are equal).
- The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this logic, and the final output is the number of valid ways to split the stick.
- The analysis shows that the program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
