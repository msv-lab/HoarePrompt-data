Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that it should be impossible to form a square. According to the problem description, the lengths of the four parts should not allow forming a square. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly. Specifically, the condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` allows for cases where `a == b`, which would allow forming a square. For example, with input `20`, the program incorrectly counts `{5, 5, 5, 5}` as a valid way, which violates the condition that it should not be possible to form a square. To fix this, the condition checking for forming a square needs to be updated.
