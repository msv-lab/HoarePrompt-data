Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
2. For a rectangle to be formed, the two smallest pieces must be equal and the two largest pieces must be equal. This means we need two pairs of equal integers whose sums satisfy certain conditions.
3. To avoid forming a square, the four parts must not all be equal.
4. The given code defines a function `func_1(n)` which iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check these conditions.
   - `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the first two parts.
   - The third and fourth parts will be `n - a - b`.
   - It checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
5. The code correctly increments the `ways` counter whenever these conditions are met.
6. The outer loop runs until `a` is less than half of `n`, and the inner loop runs until `b` is less than half of `(n - a)`, ensuring we do not exceed the total length `n`.

Given the logic and constraints, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
