You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

- Program: 
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over values of `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`. For each `a`, it then iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. The loop increments `ways` if the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` are satisfied.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
    #   - `total` remains constant at 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #   - `n` is assumed to be a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4 and remains unchanged.
    #   - `a` changes in the outer loop from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #   - `b` changes in the inner loop from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - `ways` is incremented based on the conditions met in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
    #   - The outer loop runs for each value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #   - The inner loop runs for each value of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - `ways` is incremented if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.
    #   - The loop will stop once `a` reaches `n // 2 + 1`, at which point `b` will exceed `(n - a) // 2`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**: 
    #   - When `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, the inner loop will not execute because `b` starts from `a` and `b` cannot be greater than or equal to `a` while also being within the range `(n - a) // 2`.
    #   - Therefore, `ways` will be incremented only if there exists a valid `b` within the range for any value of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
    #
    #Since the loop does not execute for `a = n // 2 + 1`, `ways` will remain 0 if no valid `b` was found in previous iterations. Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `ways` is 0.
    return ways
    #`total` is 0, `n` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is n // 2 + 1, `ways` is 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
2. For a rectangle to be formed, the two smallest pieces must be equal and the two largest pieces must be equal. This means we need two pairs of equal integers whose sums satisfy certain conditions.
3. To avoid forming a square, the four parts must not all be equal.
4. The given code defines a function `func_1(n)` which iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check these conditions.
   - `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the first two parts.
   - The third and fourth parts will be `n - a - b`.
   - It checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
5. The code correctly increments the `ways` counter whenever these conditions are met.
6. The outer loop runs until `a` is less than half of `n`, and the inner loop runs until `b` is less than half of `(n - a)`, ensuring we do not exceed the total length `n`.

Given the logic and constraints, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.
