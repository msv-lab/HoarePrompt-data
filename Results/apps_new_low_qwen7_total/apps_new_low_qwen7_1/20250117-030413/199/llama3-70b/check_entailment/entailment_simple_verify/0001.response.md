### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - For a rectangle to be formed, the two smallest pieces must be equal and the two largest pieces must be equal. This means we need two pairs of equal integers whose sums satisfy certain conditions.
   - To avoid forming a square, the four parts must not all be equal.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check these conditions.
   - `a` represents the length of the first part, and `b` represents the length of the second part.
   - The third and fourth parts are `c = d = (n - a - b) / 2`.
   - The conditions checked are `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure a rectangle can be formed but not a square.

3. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n // 2 + 1` for `a`.
   - The inner loop runs from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1` for `b`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` can form half of the total length when split into two equal parts for the rectangle.

4. **Incrementing `ways`:**
   - `ways` is incremented whenever the conditions `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` are met.
   - This ensures that we count configurations where the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square.

5. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The code correctly checks for the conditions to form a rectangle and avoids counting configurations that would form a square.
   - The loop structure ensures that all possible valid configurations are considered without repetition.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment accurately describes the behavior and correctness of the provided code. The code correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
