### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `ways` is initialized to 0.
   - The outer loop runs over `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop runs over `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - If `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `ways` is incremented.

3. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length of the two pairs `(a, b)` sums up to `n / 2`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the pairs `(a, b)` are different, thus preventing the formation of a square (since all sides would be equal).

4. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - For `n = 6`:
     - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3)
     - Only (1, 2) satisfies the conditions.
     - `ways` is incremented to 1.
   - For `n = 20`:
     - Possible pairs: (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6)
     - All these pairs satisfy the conditions.
     - `ways` is incremented to 4.

5. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - The condition `a != b` effectively prevents the formation of a square.
   - Since `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`, the only way to form a square would be if `a == b`, which is explicitly prevented by the `a != b` condition.

6. **Verification:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the loops and the conditions.
   - The final state of `ways` is correctly calculated based on the given constraints.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate. The program does correctly ensure that the formed parts cannot be a square, as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
