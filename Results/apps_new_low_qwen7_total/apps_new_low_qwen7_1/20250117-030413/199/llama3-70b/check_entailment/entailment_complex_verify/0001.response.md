### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - For a rectangle, the two smallest pieces must be equal, and the two largest pieces must be equal. This implies we need two pairs of equal integers whose sums satisfy certain conditions.
   - To avoid forming a square, the four parts must not all be equal.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square.
   - The outer loop runs over values of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop runs over values of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length of the stick is split into four parts such that the two smallest parts are `a` and `b`, and the two largest parts are `n - a - b`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the stick is split into a rectangle (not a square).

3. **Annotations Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The loop iterates through valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2(a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - The final state after the function call is that `ways` is incremented only if valid pairs are found, and otherwise remains 0.

4. **Correctness of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies valid pairs \((a, b)\) that form a rectangle but not a square.
   - The constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) are handled appropriately by the loops.
   - The function logic ensures that no square is formed by checking \(a \neq b\).

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
