### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its function summary against the problem statement and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - We need to count the number of ways to split a stick of length \( n \) into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - A rectangle requires two pairs of equal sides, while a square requires all four sides to be equal.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that \( 2(a + b) = n \) and \( a \neq b \).
   - It counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment claims the program is incorrect because it allows counting configurations where \( a = b \), which could form a square.

4. **Analysis of the Program**:
   - The program uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b`.
   - The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that \( a \neq b \) and that the sum of \( a \) and \( b \) is half of \( n \).
   - This condition correctly ensures that the parts cannot form a square since all four parts would be the same if \( a = b \).

Given the problem constraints and the function summary, the program indeed checks that \( a \neq b \) before counting the pair, which prevents any configuration that could form a square. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does handle the condition to prevent forming a square correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
