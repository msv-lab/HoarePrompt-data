Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that these parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
2. For a rectangle to be formed, the two smallest pieces must be equal and the two largest pieces must be equal. This means we need two pairs of equal integers whose sums satisfy certain conditions.
3. To avoid forming a square, the four parts must not all be equal.
4. The given code defines a function `func_1(n)` which iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check these conditions.
   - `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the first two parts.
   - The third and fourth parts will be `n - a - b`.
   - It checks if `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` to ensure a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
5. The outer loop runs until `a` is less than half of `n`, and the inner loop runs until `b` is less than half of `(n - a)`, ensuring we do not exceed the total length `n`.

Upon closer inspection of the code, we need to verify if the conditions `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b` are sufficient to guarantee that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square. Let's break down the logic:

- The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the two smallest parts (`a` and `b`) is exactly half of the total length `n`. This implies that the two largest parts (`n - a - b`) will also sum up to the same value, ensuring the four parts can form a rectangle.
- The condition `a != b` ensures that the two smallest parts are not equal, preventing the formation of a square.

The function summary provided states that the function counts the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2(a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\). This aligns with the logic of the code. The code iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check these conditions and increments the `ways` counter whenever they are met.

Given the logic and constraints, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the problem. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the code follows this behavior.

Final: **True**
