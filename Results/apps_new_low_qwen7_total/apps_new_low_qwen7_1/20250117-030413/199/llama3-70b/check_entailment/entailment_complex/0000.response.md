Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The outer loop iterates over values of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - The inner loop iterates over values of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.

2. **Conditions for Incrementing `ways`**:
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the lengths of the two parts is half of `n`, allowing the remaining two parts to also sum up to half of `n`.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the parts are distinct, preventing the formation of a square.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The loop ensures that all valid pairs \((a, b)\) are checked without redundant checks. Since the inner loop starts from `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`, it avoids counting the same pair twice and ensures that the parts are unique.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\), which directly corresponds to the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the function correctly calculates the required number of ways. The initial state analysis and the loop behavior confirm that the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
