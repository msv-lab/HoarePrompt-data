The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\)) and calculates the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2(a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\). The function returns the count of such pairs. After executing the function, the state of the program includes `total` set to 0, `n` as a positive even integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` set to \(n // 2 + 1\), and `ways` set to the count of valid pairs. If no valid pairs are found, `ways` will be 0.
