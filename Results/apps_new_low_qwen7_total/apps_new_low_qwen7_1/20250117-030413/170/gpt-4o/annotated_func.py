#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has, `k` is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values. If `remaining_rubles < b`, the output is `k + n // a`. Otherwise, the output is `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the number of rubles Kolya has, `k` is the number of glass bottles Kolya can return. If `a <= b - c`, then `n` is the integer result of `n // a`. Otherwise, `k` is calculated as `n // b + n % b // c`, and `n` is the remaining rubles after returning the glass bottles.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` represents the number of rubles Kolya has, `a` and `b` represent the cost of one plastic and one glass liter bottle, respectively, and `c` is the refund Kolya gets for returning an empty glass bottle. The function calculates and returns the maximum total amount of water Kolya can obtain by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, taking into account the refund for returning glass bottles. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `a > b - c`, Kolya cannot benefit from returning glass bottles, and the function should only calculate the number of plastic bottles he can buy.
2. If `n` is less than `a`, Kolya cannot buy any bottles, and the function should return 0.
3. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function should handle these cases correctly without any undefined behavior.
