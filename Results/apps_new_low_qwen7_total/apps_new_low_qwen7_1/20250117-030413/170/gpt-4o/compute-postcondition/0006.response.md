The code prints the sum of `k` (the number of glass bottles Kolya can return) and the integer division of `remaining_rubles` by `a`. Since `remaining_rubles` is just another name for `n` and `n` is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has, and given that `n` is less than `b`, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The integer division `remaining_rubles // a` is calculated and added to `k`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return; `n` is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has; the output of the program is `k + n // a`**
