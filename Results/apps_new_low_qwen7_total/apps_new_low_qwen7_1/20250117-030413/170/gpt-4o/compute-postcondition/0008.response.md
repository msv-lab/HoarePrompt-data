The code prints the value of `k + 1`. Since `k` is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, and the code simply increments `k` by 1 before printing, the value of `k` remains unchanged in terms of storage, but the printed value will be `k + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has, `k` is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, `a` retains its original value, `b` retains its original value, `c` retains its original value, and the output is `k + 1`**
