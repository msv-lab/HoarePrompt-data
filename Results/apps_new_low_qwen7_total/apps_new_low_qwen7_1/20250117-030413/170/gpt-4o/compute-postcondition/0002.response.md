The code snippet `print(n // a)` divides the integer `n` (the number of rubles Kolya has) by the integer `a` (the cost of one plastic liter bottle) using integer division and prints the result. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the result of the integer division.

Output State: **`n` is the integer result of `n // a`, `a` is an integer representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, `b` is an integer representing the cost of one glass liter bottle, `c` is an integer representing the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle.**
