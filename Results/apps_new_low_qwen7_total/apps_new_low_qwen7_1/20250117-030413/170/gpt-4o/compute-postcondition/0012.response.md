Functionality: **The function `func` accepts four integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` represents the number of rubles Kolya has, `a` and `b` represent the cost of one plastic and one glass liter bottle, respectively, and `c` is the refund Kolya gets for returning an empty glass bottle. The function calculates and returns the maximum total amount of water Kolya can obtain by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, taking into account the refund for returning glass bottles. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `a > b - c`, Kolya cannot benefit from returning glass bottles, and the function should only calculate the number of plastic bottles he can buy.
2. If `n` is less than `a`, Kolya cannot buy any bottles, and the function should return 0.
3. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function should handle these cases correctly without any undefined behavior.**

After executing the function, the state of the program is as follows: 
- The function returns an integer representing the maximum total amount of water Kolya can obtain.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values.
- The variable `k` is used internally to calculate the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, but it is not returned by the function.**
