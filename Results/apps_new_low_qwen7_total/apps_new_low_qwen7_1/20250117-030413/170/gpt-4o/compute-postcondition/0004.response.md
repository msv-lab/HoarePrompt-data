Output State: **n is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has, k is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, a and b retain their original values, c retains its original value**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates the number of glass bottles Kolya can return with his rubles. This is done by taking the integer division of `(n - b)` by `(b - c)` and adding 1. This formula essentially determines how many glass bottles he can buy and return for money, maximizing his remaining rubles.
- The second line calculates the remaining rubles after Kolya returns the glass bottles he can afford. It subtracts `k * (b - c)` (the total money returned from returning the glass bottles) from the initial amount of rubles `n`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values for `k` and `n` in the output state. However, we know the following:
- `k` is the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, which is calculated based on the given formula.
- `n` is updated to reflect the remaining rubles after returning the glass bottles.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not used in the code.
- `c` remains unchanged as it is not used in the calculation after the first line.
