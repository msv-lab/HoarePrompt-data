Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of rubles Kolya has, `k` is the number of glass bottles Kolya can return. If `a <= b - c`, then `n` is the integer result of `n // a`. Otherwise, `k` is calculated as `n // b + n % b // c`, and `n` is the remaining rubles after returning the glass bottles.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the initial precondition and the changes to the variables after executing the if-else block.
