You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the remaining rubles Kolya has, `k` is an integer representing the number of glass bottles Kolya can return, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values. If `remaining_rubles < b`, the output is `k + n // a`. Otherwise, the output is `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the number of rubles Kolya has, `k` is the number of glass bottles Kolya can return. If `a <= b - c`, then `n` is the integer result of `n // a`. Otherwise, `k` is calculated as `n // b + n % b // c`, and `n` is the remaining rubles after returning the glass bottles.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a` and `b` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle and the cost of one glass liter bottle, respectively. The function also considers the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle, represented by `c`.
#
#Case_1: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya cannot buy any bottles with his rubles `n` (i.e., he does not have enough money to buy even one bottle), the function returns 0.
#Case_2: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya buys only plastic bottles, the function calculates how many plastic bottles he can buy with his rubles `n` and returns the total amount of water he can get from these bottles.
#Case_3: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya buys only glass bottles, the function calculates how many glass bottles he can buy with his rubles `n` and returns the total amount of water he can get from these bottles.
#Case_4: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya optimally buys both plastic and glass bottles to maximize the total amount of water he can get, the function calculates the maximum total amount of water he can obtain and returns this value.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and an integer `c`, and return the maximum total amount of water Kolya can get by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, considering the refund for returning empty glass bottles.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
