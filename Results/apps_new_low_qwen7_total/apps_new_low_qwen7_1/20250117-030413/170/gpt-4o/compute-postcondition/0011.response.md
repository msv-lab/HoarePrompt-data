The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a` and `b` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle and the cost of one glass liter bottle, respectively. The function also considers the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle, represented by `c`.

Case_1: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya cannot buy any bottles with his rubles `n` (i.e., he does not have enough money to buy even one bottle), the function returns 0.
Case_2: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya buys only plastic bottles, the function calculates how many plastic bottles he can buy with his rubles `n` and returns the total amount of water he can get from these bottles.
Case_3: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya buys only glass bottles, the function calculates how many glass bottles he can buy with his rubles `n` and returns the total amount of water he can get from these bottles.
Case_4: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If Kolya optimally buys both plastic and glass bottles to maximize the total amount of water he can get, the function calculates the maximum total amount of water he can obtain and returns this value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and an integer `c`, and return the maximum total amount of water Kolya can get by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, considering the refund for returning empty glass bottles.
