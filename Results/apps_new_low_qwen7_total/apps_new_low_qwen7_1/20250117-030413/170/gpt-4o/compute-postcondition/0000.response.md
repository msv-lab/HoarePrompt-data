The given code snippet reads four integer inputs from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the code does not perform any operations with these variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, a is an integer representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, b is an integer representing the cost of one glass liter bottle, c is an integer representing the money Kolya gets back by returning an empty glass bottle**
