### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads four integers from standard input: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `a` (cost of a plastic bottle) is less than or equal to `b - c` (cost of a glass bottle minus the refund for returning a glass bottle), then the optimal strategy is to buy as many plastic bottles as possible since they are cheaper after considering the refund.
   - Otherwise, the program enters the logic to handle glass bottles.

3. **Glass Bottle Strategy**:
   - Calculate the number of times Kolya can buy a glass bottle and get the refund. This is computed as `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`.
   - After using up the glass bottles and getting refunds, check if the remaining rubles (`remaining_rubles`) are enough to buy another plastic bottle.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the remaining rubles are less than `b` (the cost of a glass bottle), then Kolya can buy additional plastic bottles with the remaining rubles.
   - If the remaining rubles are sufficient to buy another glass bottle, then add 1 to the count.

### Edge Cases and Validations:
- The program handles the case where `a` is cheaper or not cheaper than `b - c` appropriately.
- The logic for calculating the number of glass bottles and the subsequent purchases is sound.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
