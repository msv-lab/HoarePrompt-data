Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Initial Input and State Initialization:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   a = int(input())
   b = int(input())
   c = int(input())
   ```

2. **Case 1: `a <= b - c`**
   - If the cost of a plastic bottle (`a`) is less than or equal to the difference between the cost of a glass bottle (`b`) and the refund for returning a glass bottle (`c`):
     ```python
     if a <= b - c:
         print(n // a)
     ```
   - This case implies that it is more cost-effective to buy plastic bottles because the refund for returning glass bottles is not sufficient to make glass bottles cheaper.

3. **Case 2: `a > b - c`**
   - If the cost of a plastic bottle (`a`) is greater than the difference between the cost of a glass bottle (`b`) and the refund for returning a glass bottle (`c`):
     ```python
     else:
         k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
         remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
         if remaining_rubles < b:
             print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
         else:
             print(k + 1)
     ```
   - This case involves buying a glass bottle first, getting the refund, and using it to buy plastic bottles. We calculate the number of glass bottles Kolya can initially buy (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`), and then use the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles. If the remaining rubles are less than the cost of a glass bottle (`b`), we use the remaining rubles to buy additional plastic bottles; otherwise, we add one more plastic bottle.

### Testing with Provided Examples

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  10
  11
  9
  8
  ```
- State before the function call:
  - `n = 10`
  - `a = 11`
  - `b = 9`
  - `c = 8`

- Execution:
  - Since `a > b - c` (11 > 1):
    - `k = (10 - 9) // (9 - 8) + 1 = 2`
    - `remaining_rubles = 10 - 2 * (9 - 8) = 8`
    - Since `remaining_rubles < b` (8 < 9):
      - Output: `k + remaining_rubles // a = 2 + 8 // 11 = 2 + 0 = 2`

- Correct Output: `2`

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  10
  5
  6
  1
  ```
- State before the function call:
  - `n = 10`
  - `a = 5`
  - `b = 6`
  - `c = 1`

- Execution:
  - Since `a > b - c` (5 > 5):
    - `k = (10 - 6) // (6 - 1) + 1 = 2`
    - `remaining_rubles = 10 - 2 * (6 - 1) = 4`
    - Since `remaining_rubles < b` (4 < 6):
      - Output: `k + remaining_rubles // a = 2 + 4 // 5 = 2 + 0 = 2`

- Correct Output: `2`

### Edge Cases and Additional Scenarios

1. **If `a > b - c`:**
   - The code correctly handles the scenario where it is not beneficial to return glass bottles. It calculates the number of plastic bottles directly.

2. **If `n < a`:**
   - The code correctly outputs 0 since Kolya cannot buy any bottles.

3. **If `n == a` or `n == b`:**
   - The code correctly handles these cases by outputting the exact number of bottles Kolya can buy.

### Conclusion

After evaluating the program with the given examples and considering edge cases, the provided solution seems to handle all scenarios correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
