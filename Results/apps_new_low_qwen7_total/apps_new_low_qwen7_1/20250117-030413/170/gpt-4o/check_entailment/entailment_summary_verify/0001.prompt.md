You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts four integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` represents the number of rubles Kolya has, `a` and `b` represent the cost of one plastic and one glass liter bottle, respectively, and `c` is the refund Kolya gets for returning an empty glass bottle. The function calculates and returns the maximum total amount of water Kolya can obtain by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, taking into account the refund for returning glass bottles. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `a > b - c`, Kolya cannot benefit from returning glass bottles, and the function should only calculate the number of plastic bottles he can buy.
2. If `n` is less than `a`, Kolya cannot buy any bottles, and the function should return 0.
3. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function should handle these cases correctly without any undefined behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads four integers from standard input: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `a` (cost of a plastic bottle) is less than or equal to `b - c` (cost of a glass bottle minus the refund for returning a glass bottle), then the optimal strategy is to buy as many plastic bottles as possible since they are cheaper after considering the refund.
   - Otherwise, the program enters the logic to handle glass bottles.

3. **Glass Bottle Strategy**:
   - Calculate the number of times Kolya can buy a glass bottle and get the refund. This is computed as `(n - b) // (b - c) + 1`.
   - After using up the glass bottles and getting refunds, check if the remaining rubles (`remaining_rubles`) are enough to buy another plastic bottle.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the remaining rubles are less than `b` (the cost of a glass bottle), then Kolya can buy additional plastic bottles with the remaining rubles.
   - If the remaining rubles are sufficient to buy another glass bottle, then add 1 to the count.

### Edge Cases and Validations:
- The program handles the case where `a` is cheaper or not cheaper than `b - c` appropriately.
- The logic for calculating the number of glass bottles and the subsequent purchases is sound.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.
