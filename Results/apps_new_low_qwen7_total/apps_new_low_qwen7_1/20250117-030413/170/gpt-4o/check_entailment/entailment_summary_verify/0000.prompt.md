You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts four integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` represents the number of rubles Kolya has, `a` and `b` represent the cost of one plastic and one glass liter bottle, respectively, and `c` is the refund Kolya gets for returning an empty glass bottle. The function calculates and returns the maximum total amount of water Kolya can obtain by buying either plastic or glass bottles or a combination of both, taking into account the refund for returning glass bottles. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `a > b - c`, Kolya cannot benefit from returning glass bottles, and the function should only calculate the number of plastic bottles he can buy.
2. If `n` is less than `a`, Kolya cannot buy any bottles, and the function should return 0.
3. If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function should handle these cases correctly without any undefined behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution seems to handle the different scenarios correctly based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the code works for all given cases:

1. If `a` (cost of plastic bottle) is less than or equal to `b - c` (difference between cost of glass bottle and refund), Kolya should buy plastic bottles as they are cheaper or equal in cost after accounting for the refund from returning glass bottles. This part of the logic is handled by `print(n // a)`.

2. If `a` is greater than `b - c`, Kolya should start by buying a glass bottle and then use the refund to buy additional plastic bottles. The code calculates the number of glass bottles he can initially buy (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`) and then uses the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles. This part ensures he maximizes the number of liters of kefir he can drink.

The provided test cases and the logic in the code cover different scenarios:
- In the first example, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, return it for 8 rubles, and then use those 8 rubles to buy another glass bottle, resulting in 2 liters of kefir.
- In the second example, Kolya can buy one glass bottle and one plastic bottle, or he can buy one glass bottle, return it for 1 ruble, and use those 1 ruble to buy a plastic bottle, again resulting in 2 liters of kefir.

Since the code handles the different conditions and edge cases appropriately, and no counterexample has been found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
