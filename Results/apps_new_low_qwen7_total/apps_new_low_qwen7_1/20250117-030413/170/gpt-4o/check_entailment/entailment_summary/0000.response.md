Reasoning:

1. The provided function handles the main logic correctly:
   - If `a` (cost of a plastic bottle) is less than or equal to `b - c` (cost of a glass bottle minus the refund), it calculates how many plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly with his rubles (`n // a`).
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many glass bottles Kolya can initially buy and the remaining rubles after buying those glass bottles. It then checks if he can use those remaining rubles to buy additional plastic bottles or another glass bottle with the refund.

2. Edge cases:
   - If `a > b - c`, the function correctly skips the logic for buying glass bottles and just calculates the number of plastic bottles.
   - If `n` is less than `a`, the function does not need to do anything because Kolya cannot buy any bottles. This case is implicitly handled by the initial checks.
   - If `n` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, the function's logic still works as expected. For `n == a`, Kolya can buy exactly one plastic bottle. For `n == b`, Kolya can buy exactly one glass bottle.

3. The code appears to cover all mentioned edge cases and handles the logic for buying different types of bottles and considering refunds appropriately.

Based on the above reasoning, the function seems to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum amount of kefir Kolya can drink.

Correctness: **True**
