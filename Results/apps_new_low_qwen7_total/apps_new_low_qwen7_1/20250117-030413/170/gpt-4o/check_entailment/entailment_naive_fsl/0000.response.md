Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution seems to handle the different scenarios correctly based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the code works for all given cases:

1. If `a` (cost of plastic bottle) is less than or equal to `b - c` (difference between cost of glass bottle and refund), Kolya should buy plastic bottles as they are cheaper or equal in cost after accounting for the refund from returning glass bottles. This part of the logic is handled by `print(n // a)`.

2. If `a` is greater than `b - c`, Kolya should start by buying a glass bottle and then use the refund to buy additional plastic bottles. The code calculates the number of glass bottles he can initially buy (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`) and then uses the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles. This part ensures he maximizes the number of liters of kefir he can drink.

The provided test cases and the logic in the code cover different scenarios:
- In the first example, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, return it for 8 rubles, and then use those 8 rubles to buy another glass bottle, resulting in 2 liters of kefir.
- In the second example, Kolya can buy one glass bottle and one plastic bottle, or he can buy one glass bottle, return it for 1 ruble, and use those 1 ruble to buy a plastic bottle, again resulting in 2 liters of kefir.

Since the code handles the different conditions and edge cases appropriately, and no counterexample has been found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
