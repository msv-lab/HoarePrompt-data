Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, consisting of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string s guarantees that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once and that s represents a valid garland as described in the problem statement.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All keys in `positions` are set to the remainder of the index `i` divided by 4 (`i % 4`). The value of `dead_bulbs` remains {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0} since no updates occur for dead light bulbs ('!'). The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s` minus one after the loop completes.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All keys in `positions` are set to the remainder of the index `i` divided by 4 (`i % 4`). The value of `dead_bulbs` is updated such that for each key-value pair `(color, pos)` in `positions`, if the final value of `i` (which is the length of the string `s` minus one) modulo 4 equals `pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is equal to the length of the string `s` minus one after the loop completes. The loop executes as long as `positions` contains at least one key-value pair where `char == '!'. If `char` is not '!', the loop does not execute.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes a non-empty input string `s` of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, which consists of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string `s` ensures that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once and represents a valid garland.

After processing, the function determines the number of dead light bulbs for each color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G') based on their positions in the garland. Specifically, for each position in the string `s` that contains a '!', the function checks if the corresponding position in the garland (determined by `i % 4`) matches the position of the color in the `positions` dictionary. If there is a match, the count of dead light bulbs for that color is incremented.

The function then prints the counts of dead light bulbs for 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' in that order.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it prints the counts of dead light bulbs for each color, and the internal variables `s`, `dead_bulbs`, `positions`, and `i` are no longer accessible outside the function.
