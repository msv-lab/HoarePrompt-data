You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

- Program:
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for (color, pos) in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes a non-empty input string `s` of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, which consists of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string `s` ensures that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once and represents a valid garland.

After processing, the function determines the number of dead light bulbs for each color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G') based on their positions in the garland. Specifically, for each position in the string `s` that contains a '!', the function checks if the corresponding position in the garland (determined by `i % 4`) matches the position of the color in the `positions` dictionary. If there is a match, the count of dead light bulbs for that color is incremented.

The function then prints the counts of dead light bulbs for 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' in that order.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it prints the counts of dead light bulbs for each color, and the internal variables `s`, `dead_bulbs`, `positions`, and `i` are no longer accessible outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. It reads the input string `s` which represents the garland.
2. It initializes a dictionary `dead_bulbs` to keep track of the number of dead light bulbs for each color.
3. It creates another dictionary `positions` to map each color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G') to its position in a cycle of 4 (since no four consecutive bulbs can have the same color).
4. It iterates over the string `s`, and whenever it encounters a working bulb (one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G'), it updates the `positions` dictionary.
5. Then, it iterates over the string `s` again, and whenever it encounters a dead bulb ('!'), it checks the position of the corresponding color in the `positions` dictionary. If the current index modulo 4 matches the stored position, it increments the count of dead bulbs for that color in the `dead_bulbs` dictionary.
6. Finally, it prints the counts of dead bulbs for each color.

This approach seems logically sound given the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement. Specifically:
- The garland ensures that no four consecutive bulbs are the same color, which simplifies the logic of determining the color positions.
- The fact that at least one bulb of each color is working guarantees that we can correctly map the colors to their positions.
- The program correctly handles the mapping of dead bulbs to their respective colors based on their positions in the garland.

Given this analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the problem.
