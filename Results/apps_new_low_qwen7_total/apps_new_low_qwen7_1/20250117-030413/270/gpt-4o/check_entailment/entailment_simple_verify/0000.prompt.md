You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for (color, pos) in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, consisting of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where '!' denotes a dead light bulb. The string s guarantees that each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once and that s represents a valid garland as described in the problem statement.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All keys in `positions` are set to the remainder of the index `i` divided by 4 (`i % 4`). The value of `dead_bulbs` remains {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0} since no updates occur for dead light bulbs ('!'). The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s` minus one after the loop completes.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All keys in `positions` are set to the remainder of the index `i` divided by 4 (`i % 4`). The value of `dead_bulbs` is updated such that for each key-value pair `(color, pos)` in `positions`, if the final value of `i` (which is the length of the string `s` minus one) modulo 4 equals `pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is equal to the length of the string `s` minus one after the loop completes. The loop executes as long as `positions` contains at least one key-value pair where `char == '!'. If `char` is not '!', the loop does not execute.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly count the number of dead light bulbs for each color in the garland. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `dead_bulbs` to store the count of dead bulbs for each color and a dictionary `positions` to store the last valid position for each color.

2. **Finding Valid Positions**: It iterates through the string to find the last valid position for each color ('R', 'B', 'Y', 'G') using the modulo operation. This ensures that the positions are within the cycle of four different colors.

3. **Counting Dead Bulbs**: It then iterates through the string again to count the dead bulbs. For each dead bulb ('!'), it checks if the position matches the last valid position for any color. If it does, it increments the corresponding count in `dead_bulbs`.

4. **Guaranteed Validity**: Given the constraints that each color has at least one working bulb and the garland structure, the logic correctly identifies the positions of the last valid bulbs for each color.

Since the program handles all given examples correctly and follows the problem description accurately for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
