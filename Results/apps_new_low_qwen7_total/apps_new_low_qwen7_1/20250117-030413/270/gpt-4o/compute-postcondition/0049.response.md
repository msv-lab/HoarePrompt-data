Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, and the remainder when `i` is divided by 4 is equal to `pos`; `color` is the next color in the dictionary corresponding to `pos`, and `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is empty, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition for the entire if-else block. The postcondition includes the initial state described in the precondition and updates the state according to the if part's operation.
