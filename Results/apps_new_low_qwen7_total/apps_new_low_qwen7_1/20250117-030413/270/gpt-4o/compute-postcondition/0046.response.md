Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, and the remainder when `i` is divided by 4 is equal to `pos`; `color` is the next color in the dictionary, and `pos` is the corresponding position in the dictionary; if `i % 4 == pos`, then `dead_bulbs[color]` is increased by 1. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur in this case.***
