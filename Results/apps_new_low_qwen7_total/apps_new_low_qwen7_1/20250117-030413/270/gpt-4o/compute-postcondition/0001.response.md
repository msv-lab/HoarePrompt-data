Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves `i` and `char`, which are generated by the `enumerate(s)` function. 

2. **Understand the role of each variable**:
   - `i`: This is the index of the current character in the string `s`.
   - `char`: This is the current character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the initial conditions required for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one character in the string `s` to iterate over. Since `s` is a non-empty string, this condition is already satisfied.
   - The first iteration of the loop will occur when `i` is 0, because `enumerate(s)` starts indexing from 0.

4. **Check the initial state of other relevant variables**:
   - `dead_bulbs` and `positions` are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, we don't need to modify them for the loop to execute.

5. **Formulate the required state**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `char` must be the first character in the string `s`.

Given the above points, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s`**
