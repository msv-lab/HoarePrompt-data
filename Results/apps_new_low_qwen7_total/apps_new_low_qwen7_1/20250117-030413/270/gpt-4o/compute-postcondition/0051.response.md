Postcondition: **`i` is an integer starting from `i_0 + (n + 1)`, `char` remains the next character in the string `s`, and `dead_bulbs[color]` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `i % 4 == pos` is true for the respective `color` and `pos` in the `positions` dictionary. The loop continues until there are no more colors in the `positions` dictionary that satisfy the condition `i % 4 == pos`. If `char` is not '!', these operations still occur.**
