Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the index variable.
   - `char`: This is the character from the string `s` at position `i`.

2. **Understand the Initial Conditions:**
   - `positions`: All keys in `positions` are set to the remainder of the index `i` divided by 4 (`i % 4`).
   - `dead_bulbs`: Remains unchanged as no updates occur for dead light bulbs.
   - `i`: After the loop completes, it will be equal to the length of the string `s` minus one.

3. **Determine the Condition for the First Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the index `i` must be within the valid range of the string `s`.
   - The string `s` starts from index 0 and goes up to its length minus one.

4. **Formulate the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, the loop will execute the first time when `i` is 0.
   - The corresponding character `char` should be the first character in the string `s`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be 0.
- `char` must be the first character in the string `s`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s`**
