To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions required.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts:**
  - `i` is `i_0 + 1`
  - `char` is the next character in the string `s`
  
- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for (color, pos) in positions.items():
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variables:**
   - The loop is iterating over key-value pairs from the dictionary `positions`.
   - The loop variables are `(color, pos)`, where `color` is the key and `pos` is the value.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are items in the dictionary `positions`.
   - Therefore, the loop can only execute if `positions` is not empty.

3. **Initial States:**
   - `i` being `i_0 + 1` and `char` being the next character in the string `s` are not directly related to the condition for the loop to execute. These variables might be part of a different context or unrelated to the current loop.
   
4. **Required Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `positions` must contain at least one key-value pair.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop iterates over the items in `positions`, the only requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `positions` should have at least one item.

### Final Answer:
State: **`positions` must have at least one key-value pair**
