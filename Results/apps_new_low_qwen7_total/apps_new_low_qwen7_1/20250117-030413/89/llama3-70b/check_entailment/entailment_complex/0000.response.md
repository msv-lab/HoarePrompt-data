Reasoning:

1. **Function `count_zeros(n)`**:
   - This function takes an integer `n` and returns the count of '0's in its binary representation.
   - The function checks the precondition that the binary representation of `n` contains at least one '1', which is necessary to avoid counting leading zeros in the binary representation.
   - The function `bin(n)` converts `n` to its binary string representation, and `.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in that string.
   - This function is correct for the range \(5 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` and counts how many integers in the range `[a, b]` have exactly one '0' in their binary representation.
   - The function iterates through each integer `year` in the range `[a, b]` and uses `count_zeros(year)` to check if the number of '0's in the binary representation of `year` is exactly one.
   - If so, it increments the `count`.
   - The function correctly handles the range \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - Edge cases such as when `a` or `b` is less than 1 are handled by the precondition that `1 <= a <= b <= 10^18`.
   - The function also correctly handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\).

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program structure is clear and follows the problem description.
   - Both functions work correctly within their specified ranges and handle edge cases appropriately.
   - The overall program logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
