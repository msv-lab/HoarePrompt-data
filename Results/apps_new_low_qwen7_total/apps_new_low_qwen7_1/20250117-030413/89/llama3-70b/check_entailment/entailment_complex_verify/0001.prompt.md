You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Annotated Code: 
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `year` is `b`, and `count` is the total number of integers `year` in the range `[a, b]` inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is the total number of integers year in the range [a, b] inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of year is exactly 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as parameters, where `1 <= a <= b <= 10^18`. It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and counts how many of these integers have exactly one zero in their decimal representation. The function returns this count. 

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If `a` or `b` is less than 1, the function will treat them as 1 because of the preconditions specified.
- If `a` and `b` are equal and represent a number with exactly one zero, it will be counted.
- If `a` and `b` are such that no number between them has exactly one zero, the function will return 0.
- The function correctly handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), ensuring it can process very large numbers efficiently.
- If `a` or `b` has leading zeros in their string representation, the function will still correctly count the number of zeros in the decimal representation, as per the problem statement.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of n, where n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` such that \(5 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and ensures its binary representation contains at least one '1'. It then returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of `n`. The function correctly handles the specified range and ensures the binary representation includes at least one '1' before performing the count. The potential edge case where `n` is the smallest possible value (5) or the largest possible value (\(10^{18}\)) is considered, as these values might have unique binary representations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the `func_1` and `count_zeros` functions.

1. **Function `count_zeros(n)`**:
   - This function converts an integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`, which returns a string like `'0b101'` for the number `5`.
   - It then counts the number of zeros in this binary string using `.count('0')`.
   - This function correctly returns the number of zeros in the binary representation of a number.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)` to get the number of zeros in its binary representation.
   - If the result is exactly 1, it increments the `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the total count of such years.

Given the problem statement, this approach is correct because:
- The function checks every year within the specified interval.
- It correctly identifies years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.
- The logic is straightforward and does not miss any cases or introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of years between `a` and `b` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

### Correctness:
**True**
