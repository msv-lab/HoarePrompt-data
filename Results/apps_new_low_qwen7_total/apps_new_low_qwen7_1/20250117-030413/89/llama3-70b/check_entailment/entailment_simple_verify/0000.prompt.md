You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Annotated Code: 
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `year` is `b`, and `count` is the total number of integers `year` in the range `[a, b]` inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is the total number of integers year in the range [a, b] inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of year is exactly 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of n, where n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses the `func_1` function to iterate through each year in the given interval and checks if the number of zeros in the binary representation of the year is exactly one using the `count_zeros` function. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Interval Iteration**: The program iterates through each year in the given interval from `a` to `b`, inclusive.
2. **Binary Conversion and Zero Counting**: For each year, the program converts the year to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and counts the number of zeros using `count_zeros(n)`.
3. **Condition Check**: If the count of zeros is exactly one, the program increments the counter.

Given the nature of the problem and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies years with exactly one zero in their binary representation within the specified interval. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
