Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

# Annotated Program:
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `year` is `b`, and `count` is the total number of integers `year` in the range `[a, b]` inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is the total number of integers year in the range [a, b] inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of year is exactly 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of n, where n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'
