Reasoning:

1. The program structure is clear and follows the problem requirements.
2. The main function `func_1` correctly iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]` and uses the helper function `count_zeros` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
3. The helper function `count_zeros` correctly counts the number of zeros in the binary representation of a given number.
4. The logic for counting years with exactly one zero in their binary representation is sound and follows the problem statement.
5. The program handles the input and output as specified, taking two integers as input and printing one integer as output.
6. There are no logical errors or off-by-one mistakes in the code that could lead to incorrect results.

Based on the above reasoning, the annotated program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
