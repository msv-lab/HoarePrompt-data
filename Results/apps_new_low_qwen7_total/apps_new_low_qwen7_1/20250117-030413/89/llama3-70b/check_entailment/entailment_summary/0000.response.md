Reasoning:
1. The problem requires counting the number of years within a given interval [a, b] that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
2. The solution provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count_zeros`.
3. `count_zeros` is a helper function that correctly counts the number of zeros in the binary representation of a given number `n`. It uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to its binary representation and then counts the occurrences of '0'.
4. `func_1` iterates through each year in the given interval, uses `count_zeros` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation, and increments a counter if true.
5. Both functions handle the specified ranges and edge cases appropriately:
   - They correctly handle the range \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - They correctly handle the smallest possible input values (e.g., 1, 5, and \(10^{18}\)).
   - They ensure the binary representation includes at least one '1'.

Given the descriptions and the execution summaries, the implementation of both functions meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
