### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the `func_1` and `count_zeros` functions.

1. **Function `count_zeros(n)`**:
   - This function converts an integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`, which returns a string like `'0b101'` for the number `5`.
   - It then counts the number of zeros in this binary string using `.count('0')`.
   - This function correctly returns the number of zeros in the binary representation of a number.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)` to get the number of zeros in its binary representation.
   - If the result is exactly 1, it increments the `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the total count of such years.

Given the problem statement, this approach is correct because:
- The function checks every year within the specified interval.
- It correctly identifies years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.
- The logic is straightforward and does not miss any cases or introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of years between `a` and `b` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

### Correctness:
**True**
