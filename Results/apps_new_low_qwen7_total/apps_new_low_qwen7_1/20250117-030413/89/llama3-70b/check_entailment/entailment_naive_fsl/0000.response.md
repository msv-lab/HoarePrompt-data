Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses the `func_1` function to iterate through each year in the given interval and checks if the number of zeros in the binary representation of the year is exactly one using the `count_zeros` function. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Interval Iteration**: The program iterates through each year in the given interval from `a` to `b`, inclusive.
2. **Binary Conversion and Zero Counting**: For each year, the program converts the year to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and counts the number of zeros using `count_zeros(n)`.
3. **Condition Check**: If the count of zeros is exactly one, the program increments the counter.

Given the nature of the problem and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies years with exactly one zero in their binary representation within the specified interval. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
