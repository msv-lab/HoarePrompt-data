Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `year` is `a`, `count` is 1, and the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1. Since there is no else part, this is the final state of the program.***
