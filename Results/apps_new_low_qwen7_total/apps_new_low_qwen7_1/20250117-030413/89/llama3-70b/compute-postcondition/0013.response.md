The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and both are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form. The function returns `count`, which is the total number of integers `year` in the range \([a, b]\) inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1.
