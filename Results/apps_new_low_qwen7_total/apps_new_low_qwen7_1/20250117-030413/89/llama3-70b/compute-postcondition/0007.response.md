Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 1`, and `count` is 2, assuming the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1. If the condition `count_zeros(year) == 1` is true, `count` becomes 2. There is no change if the condition is false.***
