The function `count_zeros` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of `n` contains at least one '1'. After executing the function body, the function returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count_zeros` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the count of '0's in its binary representation.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 5 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of `n` contains at least one '1', and returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of `n`.**
