#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, and both a and b are represented without leading zeros in their decimal form.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `year` is `b`, and `count` is the total number of integers `year` in the range `[a, b]` inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of `year` is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is the total number of integers year in the range [a, b] inclusive, where the number of zeros in the decimal representation of year is exactly 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as parameters, where `1 <= a <= b <= 10^18`. It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and counts how many of these integers have exactly one zero in their decimal representation. The function returns this count. 

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If `a` or `b` is less than 1, the function will treat them as 1 because of the preconditions specified.
- If `a` and `b` are equal and represent a number with exactly one zero, it will be counted.
- If `a` and `b` are such that no number between them has exactly one zero, the function will return 0.
- The function correctly handles the upper limit of \(10^{18}\), ensuring it can process very large numbers efficiently.
- If `a` or `b` has leading zeros in their string representation, the function will still correctly count the number of zeros in the decimal representation, as per the problem statement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of n, where n is an integer such that 5 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and the binary representation of n contains at least one '1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` such that \(5 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and ensures its binary representation contains at least one '1'. It then returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of `n`. The function correctly handles the specified range and ensures the binary representation includes at least one '1' before performing the count. The potential edge case where `n` is the smallest possible value (5) or the largest possible value (\(10^{18}\)) is considered, as these values might have unique binary representations.
