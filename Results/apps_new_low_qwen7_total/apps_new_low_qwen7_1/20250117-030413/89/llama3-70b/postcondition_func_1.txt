The function `count_zeros` accepts an integer `n` such that \(5 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and ensures its binary representation contains at least one '1'. It then returns the count of '0's in the binary representation of `n`. The function correctly handles the specified range and ensures the binary representation includes at least one '1' before performing the count. The potential edge case where `n` is the smallest possible value (5) or the largest possible value (\(10^{18}\)) is considered, as these values might have unique binary representations.
