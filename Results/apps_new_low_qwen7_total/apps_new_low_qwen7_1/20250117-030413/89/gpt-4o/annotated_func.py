def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is the total number of integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of integers between a and b (inclusive) that have exactly one zero in their binary representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through each integer from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and checks if the integer has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If the condition is met, it increments a counter. After the iteration, the function returns the count of such integers. The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are within the specified range, but does not handle the case where `a > b`, which would result in a range that is not valid and should ideally raise an error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1
    #The program returns True if the binary representation of x contains exactly one '0', and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. It returns `False` otherwise. The function first converts `x` to its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. Then, it counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary is '0'), or when `x` is 1 (binary is '1'), both of which should return `True`. The function correctly handles these edge cases.
