The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through each integer from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and checks if the integer has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If the condition is met, it increments a counter. After the iteration, the function returns the count of such integers. The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are within the specified range, but does not handle the case where `a > b`, which would result in a range that is not valid and should ideally raise an error.
