Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count years with exactly one zero in their binary representation within the given interval. Specifically, the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function simply checks if the binary representation of a number contains exactly one '0'. However, this function does not account for the fact that a binary number with multiple '1's can still be valid within the specified interval.

For example, consider the interval from 2015 to 2016:

- The binary representation of 2015 is `11111011111`.
- The binary representation of 2016 is `11111100000`.

Both 2015 and 2016 have more than one '0' in their binary representations, but they are within the interval. The program will incorrectly count both as having exactly one '0', which violates the problem description.

A correct approach would involve generating and checking each year within the interval individually, ensuring that the binary representation of each year has exactly one '0'. The current implementation does not achieve this.
