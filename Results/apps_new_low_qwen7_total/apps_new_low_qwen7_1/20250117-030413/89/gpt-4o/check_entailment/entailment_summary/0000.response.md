Reasoning:
- The program is composed of two functions: `func_1` and `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- `func_1` iterates through all years from `a` to `b` and uses `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` to check if a year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
- `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` correctly determines if a number has exactly one '0' in its binary representation.
- Both functions handle their tasks as described and there are no logical errors or edge cases missed in the given implementations.
- Given the problem constraints and the execution summaries, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
