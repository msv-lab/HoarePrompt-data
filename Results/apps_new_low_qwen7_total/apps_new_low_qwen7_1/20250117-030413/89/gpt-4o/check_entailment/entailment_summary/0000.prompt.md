 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    result = func_1(a, b)
    print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year):
            count += 1
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through each integer from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and checks if the integer has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If the condition is met, it increments a counter. After the iteration, the function returns the count of such integers. The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are within the specified range, but does not handle the case where `a > b`, which would result in a range that is not valid and should ideally raise an error.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. It returns `False` otherwise. The function first converts `x` to its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. Then, it counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary is '0'), or when `x` is 1 (binary is '1'), both of which should return `True`. The function correctly handles these edge cases.
