Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input and handles the range of years within the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18).
   - The functions `func_1` and `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` are defined correctly to perform the required tasks.

2. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each year in the given range [a, b].
   - For each year, it calls `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the count.
   - After the loop, it returns the count, which is the number of years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.

3. **Logic of `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`**:
   - This function converts the integer to its binary representation and counts the number of zeros.
   - It returns True if there is exactly one zero and False otherwise.
   - The logic for counting zeros is correct.

4. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main function reads the input, calls `func_1` with the parsed integers, and prints the result.
   - The program correctly follows the problem statement and does not contain any logical errors based on the provided examples and the general structure of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
