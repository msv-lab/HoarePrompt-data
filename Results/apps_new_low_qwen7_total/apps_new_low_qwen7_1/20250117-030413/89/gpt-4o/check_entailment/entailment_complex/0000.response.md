Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - For each year, it calls the helper function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year)` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the count of such years.
   - This function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It iterates through the entire range and checks each year efficiently.

2. **Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x)`**:
   - This function correctly converts the number `x` to its binary representation and checks if there is exactly one '0' in the binary string.
   - It handles edge cases such as `x = 0` and `x = 1` correctly, which both have exactly one '0' in their binary representation.
   - The function works as intended and provides the correct boolean output for the binary representation of any non-negative integer.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the range correctly and checks every integer within the given bounds.
   - There are no issues with the logic that would cause incorrect results, such as off-by-one errors or invalid ranges.
   - The functions work within the constraints provided (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18).

Given that both functions `func_1` and `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` are implemented correctly and handle all specified cases appropriately, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
