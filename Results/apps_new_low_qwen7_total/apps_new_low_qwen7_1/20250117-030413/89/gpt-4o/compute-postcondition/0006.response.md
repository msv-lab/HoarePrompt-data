`count` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1 more than its previous value. The initial value of `count` was 0, so now `count` is 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is 1**
