Functionality: **The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one '0'. It returns `False` otherwise. The function first converts `x` to its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix. Then, it counts the number of '0's in the binary string. If the count is exactly one, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary is '0'), or when `x` is 1 (binary is '1'), both of which should return `True`. The function correctly handles these edge cases.**
