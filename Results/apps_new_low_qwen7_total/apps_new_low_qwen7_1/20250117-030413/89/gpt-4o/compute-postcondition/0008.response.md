Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `year`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `year` is within the range `[a, b]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `count` is 1 if the integer `year` has exactly one zero in its binary representation. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

4. **Determine the new value of `year` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `year` in the range from `a` to `b`, at the end of the previous iteration, `year` was the maximum value in the range, i.e., `year = b`.
   - For the next iteration, `year` will be incremented to `b + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `year` is still within the range `[a, b]`.
   - Since `year` is now `b + 1`, it is no longer within the range `[a, b]`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `year` will be incremented to `b + 1`.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are the boundaries of the range.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to continue) would be:

- `year` is `b + 1`.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `count` remains 0 because the condition for incrementing `count` (having exactly one zero in the binary representation of `year`) was not met in the previous iteration.

However, since `year` is out of the range `[a, b]`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `count` is 0**.
