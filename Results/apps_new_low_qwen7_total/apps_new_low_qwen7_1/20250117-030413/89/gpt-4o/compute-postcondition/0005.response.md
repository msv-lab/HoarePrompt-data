State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for year in range(a, b + 1):`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` remain unchanged because the loop iterates over a range from `a` to `b` inclusive.
3. The variable `count` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration if the current `year` does not have exactly one zero in its binary representation.
4. Since no information is given about the specific value of `year` or its binary representation in the previous iteration, we assume that `count` remains 0 for the next iteration.
5. Therefore, `count` is adjusted to 0 for the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18, `count` is 0**.
