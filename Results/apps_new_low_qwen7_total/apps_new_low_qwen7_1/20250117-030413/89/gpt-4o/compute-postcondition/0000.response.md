The code `binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]` converts the integer `x` into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The result is stored in the variable `binary_representation`.

Since `x` is a non-negative integer, let's consider a general case where `x` is a specific non-negative integer, say `x = 5` (the exact value does not change the structure of the answer).

1. Convert `x` to binary: `bin(5)` gives `'0b101'`.
2. Remove the '0b' prefix: `'0b101'[2:]` gives `'101'`.

Therefore, `binary_representation` is set to the binary string `'101'`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer; `binary_representation` is the binary string of `x` without the '0b' prefix**
