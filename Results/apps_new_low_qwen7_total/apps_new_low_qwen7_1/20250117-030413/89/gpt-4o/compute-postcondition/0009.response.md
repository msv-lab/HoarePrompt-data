`count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is `0 + 1`, which is 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `count` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `count` is 1**
