The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but instead takes four space-separated integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` as input, where -100 ≤ `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` ≤ 100 and `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` are distinct. The coordinates represent the positions of two out of the four vertices of a square. After processing, the function determines whether these coordinates form a valid square by calculating the other two vertices based on the given coordinates. If the calculated coordinates (`x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value explicitly but provides output based on the validity of the input coordinates.
