Reasoning:

The annotated program logic needs to correctly determine the coordinates of the other two vertices of the square based on the given two vertices. Let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is parsed correctly into `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `x1` is equal to `x2`. This check is crucial because if `x1 == x2`, the points lie on a vertical line, and the square's sides are horizontal, meaning we need to use the differences in y-coordinates to find the other two vertices. Similarly, if `y1 == y2`, the points lie on a horizontal line, and the square's sides are vertical.

3. **Calculating Other Vertices**:
   - If `x1 == x2`, the other two vertices should be at `(x1 + (y1 - y2), y1)` and `(x1 - (y1 - y2), y1)`.
   - If `y1 == y2`, the other two vertices should be at `(x1, y1 + (x1 - x2))` and `(x1, y1 - (x1 - x2))`.

4. **Range Check**: The program checks if the calculated coordinates are within the specified range (-1000 to 1000). If they are, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, there are some issues with the current implementation:

- The logic for calculating the other vertices when `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2` is missing. These conditions need to be handled properly.
- The logic provided does not handle the case where the points are not aligned horizontally or vertically, which would mean forming a diagonal of the square. This needs additional calculations.

Here is the corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if points are distinct
    if (x1 == x2 and y1 == y2):
        print(-1)
        return

    # Calculate the side length and direction
    dx = abs(x1 - x2)
    dy = abs(y1 - y2)

    # Determine the fourth point based on the direction
    if x1 < x2:
        x3, x4 = x2 + dx, x2 - dx
        y3, y4 = y1, y2
    else:
        x3, x4 = x1, x2
        y3, y4 = y1 + dy, y1 - dy

    # Check if the calculated coordinates are within the range
    if (-1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected code handles all cases correctly and ensures that the calculated coordinates are valid. Therefore, the original program as annotated is **incorrect** due to the missing conditions and the logic for calculating the other vertices when the points are not aligned horizontally or vertically.

Correctness: **False**
