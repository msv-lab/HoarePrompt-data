Reasoning:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of the remaining two vertices of the square given two of its vertices. The key observation is that for any two given vertices of a square, the other two vertices can be found by rotating the known vertices by 90 degrees around their midpoint.

However, the provided solution attempts to find the other two vertices by assuming the given points are adjacent or opposite on the same side of the square, which is not always true. This approach will fail in many cases.

Let's break down the logic in the given code:

1. **Identifying Adjacent Vertices**: The code checks if the x-coordinates are the same. If they are, it assumes the points are on the same vertical line.
2. **Finding Remaining Vertices**: Based on the assumption of adjacency, it calculates the remaining vertices by adding or subtracting the difference in y-coordinates from the known x-coordinate. This is flawed because it does not consider the actual geometric properties of a square.
3. **Checking Range**: Finally, it checks if the calculated points fall within the specified range and prints them if so; otherwise, it prints -1.

Given these issues, the solution is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
