You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).


-----Examples-----
Input
0 0 0 1

Output
1 0 1 1

Input
0 0 1 1

Output
0 1 1 0

Input
0 0 1 2

Output
-1

- Program:
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x2:
        (x3, x4) = (x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2))
        (y3, y4) = (y1, y2)
    else:
        (y3, y4) = (y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2))
        (x3, x4) = (x1, x2)
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but instead takes four space-separated integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` as input, where -100 ≤ `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` ≤ 100 and `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` are distinct. The coordinates represent the positions of two out of the four vertices of a square. After processing, the function determines whether these coordinates form a valid square by calculating the other two vertices based on the given coordinates. If the calculated coordinates (`x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value explicitly but provides output based on the validity of the input coordinates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the two given points are diagonally opposite each other. For instance, consider the input:

```
0 0 1 1
```

In this case, the program should output two possible sets of coordinates for the remaining two points, such as `0 1 1 0` or `1 0 0 1`. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly return `-1`.

To fix this, we need to handle the diagonal case separately. Here’s an updated version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if the points are horizontally aligned
    if x1 == x2:
        x3, x4 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2)
        y3, y4 = y1, y2
    # Check if the points are vertically aligned
    elif y1 == y2:
        y3, y4 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2)
        x3, x4 = x1, x2
    # Check if the points are diagonally aligned
    elif abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2):
        x3, x4 = x1, x2
        y3, y4 = y1, y2
    else:
        print(-1)
        return

    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y4 <= 1000:
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This updated function checks for the diagonal case and handles it appropriately, ensuring that the program works for all potential inputs.
