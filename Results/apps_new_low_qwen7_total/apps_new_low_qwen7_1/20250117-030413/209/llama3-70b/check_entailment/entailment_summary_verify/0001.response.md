Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads four space-separated integers representing the coordinates of two vertices of a square. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Logic for Finding Remaining Vertices**:
   - If `x1 == x2`, the code assumes the points are on the same vertical line and calculates the other two vertices by using the difference in y-coordinates.
   - Similarly, if `x1 != x2`, it assumes the points are on the same horizontal line and calculates the other two vertices by using the difference in x-coordinates.

This logic is fundamentally flawed because it does not account for the geometric properties of a square. Specifically, the code assumes the given points are adjacent, which is not necessarily true. For example, if the given points are at opposite corners of the square, the code would fail to correctly determine the other two vertices.

3. **Range Check**: The code performs a range check on the calculated vertices before printing them. However, the core logic for finding the vertices is incorrect.

Given the examples provided:
- In the first example (0, 0) and (0, 1), the code correctly identifies that the points are on the same vertical line and calculates the other two vertices as (1, 0) and (1, 1).
- In the second example (0, 0) and (1, 1), the code correctly identifies that the points are diagonally opposite and calculates the other two vertices as (0, 1) and (1, 0).

However, in the third example (0, 0) and (1, 2), the code fails because the points are not adjacent or opposite on the same side, and the calculated vertices (which should be (1, 0) and (2, 2)) fall outside the range [-1000, 1000].

Since the core logic of the code is incorrect and fails for some valid inputs, the function does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function is not correct for all possible inputs.

Final: **False**
