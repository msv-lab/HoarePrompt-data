### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fails to handle the case where the two given points are diagonally opposite each other. This is evident from the example provided in the assessment:

- For the input `0 0 1 1`, the expected output should be `0 1 1 0` or `1 0 0 1`, but the current implementation returns `-1`.

The original assessment suggests an updated version of the function that explicitly checks for the diagonal case. Let's analyze the annotated code and verify if this update is necessary.

1. **Horizontal Alignment**:
   - If `x1 == x2`, the points are horizontally aligned.
   - The code correctly calculates `x3` and `x4` based on the difference in y-coordinates, and `y3` and `y4` remain `y1` and `y2`.

2. **Vertical Alignment**:
   - If `y1 == y2`, the points are vertically aligned.
   - The code correctly calculates `y3` and `y4` based on the difference in x-coordinates, and `x3` and `x4` remain `x1` and `x2`.

3. **Diagonal Alignment**:
   - If the points are not horizontally or vertically aligned (`abs(x1 - x2) != abs(y1 - y2)`), they are diagonally aligned.
   - The code assigns `x3` and `x4` to `x1` and `x2`, and `y3` and `y4` to `y1` and `y2`.

However, the diagonal case is not handled properly because it does not ensure that the resulting points form a valid square. In a valid square, the distances between the points must satisfy the properties of a square. Specifically, the distances between the points should be equal, and the points should form right angles.

The current implementation of the diagonal case does not account for these constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in pointing out the flaw in handling the diagonal case. The provided fix in the original assessment is appropriate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the diagonal case correctly, leading to invalid outputs in certain scenarios. The provided fix in the original assessment addresses this issue.
