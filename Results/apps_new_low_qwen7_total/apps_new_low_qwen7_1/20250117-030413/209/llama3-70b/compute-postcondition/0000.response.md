The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Since the input is in the form of space-separated integers, these variables are now integers. The initial conditions specify that these coordinates represent the positions of two out of the four vertices of a square, but the code itself does not affect this geometric constraint. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are directly assigned from the input.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers assigned from the input, representing two vertices of a square.**
