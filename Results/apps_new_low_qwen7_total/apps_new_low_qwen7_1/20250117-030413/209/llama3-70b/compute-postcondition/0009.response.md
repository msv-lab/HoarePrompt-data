The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3` is equal to `x1`, `x4` is equal to `x2`, `y3` is equal to `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, `y4` is equal to `y1 - |x1 - x2|`.**
