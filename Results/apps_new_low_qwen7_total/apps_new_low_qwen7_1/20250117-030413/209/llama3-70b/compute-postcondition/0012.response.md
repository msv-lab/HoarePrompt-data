Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but instead takes four space-separated integers `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` as input, where -100 ≤ `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` ≤ 100 and `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2` are distinct. The coordinates represent the positions of two out of the four vertices of a square. After processing, the function determines whether these coordinates form a valid square by calculating the other two vertices based on the given coordinates. If the calculated coordinates (`x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value explicitly but provides output based on the validity of the input coordinates.**

**Edge Cases:**
1. If the input coordinates do not satisfy the condition `x1 != x2` and `y1 != y2`, the function will not correctly calculate the other two vertices. However, the function checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000] before printing them, which handles this case appropriately.
2. The function ensures that the calculated coordinates fall within the specified range [-1000, 1000]. If the calculated coordinates exceed this range, the function prints `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
The provided code and annotations do not explicitly mention the validation of the input coordinates to ensure they are distinct. While the function assumes the inputs are distinct due to the distinctness check in the code, it would be clearer if this was explicitly stated or checked within the function.
