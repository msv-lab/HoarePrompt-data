Postcondition: ***`x3`, `x4`, `y3`, `y4` are integers. If `x1 == x2`, then `x3` is `x1 + |y1 - y2|`, `x4` is `x1 - |y1 - y2|`, `y3` is `y1`, and `y4` is `y2`. Otherwise, `x3` is `x1`, `x4` is `x2`, `y3` is `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, and `y4` is `y1 - |x1 - x2|`. Additionally, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` are all within the range [-1000, 1000].***
