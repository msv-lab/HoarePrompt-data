Initial State: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers assigned from the input, representing two vertices of a square. `x1` is not equal to `x2`

Code Execution:
1. `y3, y4 = y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`
   - Since `x1` and `x2` are the x-coordinates of two vertices of a square and they are different, the absolute difference `abs(x1 - x2)` represents the side length of the square (assuming the vertices are at `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`).
   - `y3` is calculated as `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`, which means moving vertically up or down by the side length of the square from `y1`.
   - `y4` is calculated as `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`, which means moving vertically down or up by the side length of the square from `y1`.

2. `x3, x4 = x1, x2`
   - `x3` is assigned the value of `x1`.
   - `x4` is assigned the value of `x2`.

Final Output State: **x1 is the original value of x1, y1 is the original value of y1, x2 is the original value of x2, y2 is the original value of y2, x3 is the original value of x1, x4 is the original value of x2, y3 is the original value of y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y4 is the original value of y1 - abs(x1 - x2)**
