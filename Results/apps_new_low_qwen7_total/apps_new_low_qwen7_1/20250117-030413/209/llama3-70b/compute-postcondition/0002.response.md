Initial State: `x1` and `x2` are integers, both currently equal, `y1` and `y2` are integers assigned from the input, representing two vertices of a square.

Code Snippet:
```
x3, x4 = x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2)
y3, y4 = y1, y2
```

Analysis:
1. The first line calculates `x3` and `x4` based on the values of `x1` and the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
   - Since `x1` equals `x2` initially, `x3` will be `x1 + |y1 - y2|` and `x4` will be `x1 - |y1 - y2|`.
   - The absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` (representing two vertices of a square) means one vertex will be at `y1` and the opposite vertex at `y2`, or vice versa.
2. The second line simply assigns `y1` to `y3` and `y2` to `y4`.

Given that `x1` and `x2` are equal and represent the same coordinate, the values of `x3` and `x4` will be `x1 + |y1 - y2|` and `x1 - |y1 - y2|`, respectively. Since `y1` and `y2` are inputs representing two vertices of a square, their values determine the height of the square along the y-axis.

Final Output State: **x1 is an integer, x2 is equal to x1, x3 is x1 + |y1 - y2|, x4 is x1 - |y1 - y2|, y1 is an integer, y2 is an integer, y3 is y1, y4 is y2**
