Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2`, then `x3` is set to `x1 + |y1 - y2|`, `x4` is set to `x1 - |y1 - y2|`, and `y3` and `y4` remain unchanged as `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, `x3` remains unchanged as `x1`, `x4` remains unchanged as `x2`, and `y3` is set to `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, `y4` is set to `y1 - |x1 - x2|`.***
