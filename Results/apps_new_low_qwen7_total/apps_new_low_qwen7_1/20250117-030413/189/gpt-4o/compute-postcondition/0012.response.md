Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must contain at least one element, `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\), and `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{\text{groups}[i] + 1}{2}\right)\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\). If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.**
