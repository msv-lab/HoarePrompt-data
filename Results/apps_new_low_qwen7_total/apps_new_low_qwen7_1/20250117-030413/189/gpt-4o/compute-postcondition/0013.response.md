The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and the sum of all elements in `a` is less than or equal to 8 * n.

The output of the function depends on the input parameters and their relationships, but since no specific return values or conditions are mentioned in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of integers each between 1 and 10000, with the sum of all elements in `a` less than or equal to 8 * n.**
