You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must contain at least one element, `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\), `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{\text{groups}[i] + 1}{2}\right)\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\).

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `groups` list.
   - For each `soldiers` value (where `soldiers` is an element in `groups`), it calculates the number of pairs as \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\) and adds this to `total_pairs_needed`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `k`, `max_pairs_per_row`.
   - **Variable Updates**: 
     - `total_pairs_needed` is updated in each iteration by adding \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\).
     - `soldiers` takes on the value of the current element in the `groups` list in each iteration.
   - **Final State**: After the loop completes, `total_pairs_needed` will be the sum of \((\text{groups}[i] + 1) // 2\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\).

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `k` times, once for each element in the `groups` list.
   - The final value of `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of the calculated pairs for each element in `groups`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship between the elements in `groups` and the calculation of `total_pairs_needed` is consistent with the loop behavior.
   - The invariants (`n`, `k`, `max_pairs_per_row`) remain unchanged throughout the loop, confirming their constancy.
   - The final `total_pairs_needed` value is derived correctly by summing up the pairs for all elements in `groups`.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
if condition:
```
if (total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
