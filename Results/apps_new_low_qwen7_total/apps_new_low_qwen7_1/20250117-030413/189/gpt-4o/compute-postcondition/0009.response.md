The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only information that changes is the output printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must contain at least one element, `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\), `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{\text{groups}[i] + 1}{2}\right)\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\), and the current value of `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`; 'YES' is printed to the console.**
