`total_pairs_needed` is assigned the value of `(soldiers + 1) // 2`. The value of `total_pairs_needed` is updated based on the value of `soldiers`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must have at least one element, `soldiers` is the next element in the list, `total_pairs_needed` is increased by `(soldiers + 1) // 2`**
