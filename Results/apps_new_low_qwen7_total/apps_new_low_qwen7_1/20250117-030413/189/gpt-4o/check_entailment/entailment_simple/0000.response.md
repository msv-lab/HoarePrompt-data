### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Reading and Validation**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and splits it into `n`, `k`, and the list of soldiers in each group.
   - The constraints are checked and validated to ensure `1 ≤ n ≤ 10000`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, and the sum of all soldiers in groups is less than or equal to `8 * n`.

2. **Calculation of Total Pairs Needed**:
   - The loop correctly calculates the total number of pairs needed, where each pair ensures that no two soldiers from different groups sit next to each other. The formula \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\) ensures that each group's soldiers are paired such that each pair occupies two non-neighboring seats.

3. **Comparison with Maximum Possible Pairs**:
   - The program compares `total_pairs_needed` with `max_pairs_per_row` (which is `4 * n`), which represents the maximum number of pairs that can be seated in the airplane without violating the neighboring constraint.
   - If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, it means the arrangement is possible; otherwise, it is not.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the number of required pairs does not exceed the maximum possible pairs; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to arrange the soldiers such that no two soldiers from different groups are seated next to each other.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program accurately follows the problem statement and logic, ensuring that the final output is correct based on the given constraints and calculations.

**Correctness: True**
