Reasoning:  
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values from standard input and splits them into the necessary variables `n`, `k`, and the list `groups`.

2. **Pair Calculation**: For each group, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of pairs needed using the formula `(\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that each pair occupies two adjacent seats, and it ensures that even if the number of soldiers in a group is odd, at least one additional seat is required to prevent neighbors.

3. **Total Pairs Needed**: The program sums up the calculated pairs for all groups to get `total_pairs_needed`.

4. **Comparison with Available Seats**: The program checks if `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, which is \(4 \times n\). If this condition holds, it means that the available seats are sufficient to accommodate the groups without any two soldiers from different groups sitting next to each other.

5. **Output**: Based on the comparison, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Given the logical steps and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
