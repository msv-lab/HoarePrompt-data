Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the input and splits it into individual variables `n` and `k`, followed by parsing the `groups` list. This part is correct.

2. **Calculation of Pairs Needed**: The code calculates the total number of pairs needed using the formula \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\) for each group size and sums these values to get `total_pairs_needed`. This calculation is mathematically sound for determining the number of pairs needed.

3. **Comparison with Available Rows**: The code checks if `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row` (which is \(4 \times n\)). This check is correct because it ensures that the total number of pairs required fits within the available rows, considering that each row can accommodate up to 4 pairs (since only non-neighboring seats are considered).

4. **Output**: Based on the comparison, the code prints "YES" if the condition is met and "NO" otherwise. This output logic is correct according to the problem statement.

Given that all parts of the program adhere to the problem requirements and logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
