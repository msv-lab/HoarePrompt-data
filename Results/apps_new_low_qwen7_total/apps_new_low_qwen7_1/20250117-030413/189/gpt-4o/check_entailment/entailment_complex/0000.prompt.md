Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must contain at least one element, `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\), `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{\text{groups}[i] + 1}{2}\right)\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\).
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each element in the `groups` list.
    #   - For each `soldiers` value (where `soldiers` is an element in `groups`), it calculates the number of pairs as \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\) and adds this to `total_pairs_needed`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - **Invariant Variables**: `n`, `k`, `max_pairs_per_row`.
    #   - **Variable Updates**: 
    #     - `total_pairs_needed` is updated in each iteration by adding \((\text{soldiers} + 1) // 2\).
    #     - `soldiers` takes on the value of the current element in the `groups` list in each iteration.
    #   - **Final State**: After the loop completes, `total_pairs_needed` will be the sum of \((\text{groups}[i] + 1) // 2\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\).
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will execute exactly `k` times, once for each element in the `groups` list.
    #   - The final value of `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of the calculated pairs for each element in `groups`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationship between the elements in `groups` and the calculation of `total_pairs_needed` is consistent with the loop behavior.
    #   - The invariants (`n`, `k`, `max_pairs_per_row`) remain unchanged throughout the loop, confirming their constancy.
    #   - The final `total_pairs_needed` value is derived correctly by summing up the pairs for all elements in `groups`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is as described above.
    if (total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\), `groups` is a list of \(k\) integers where \(1 \leq \text{groups}[i] \leq 10000\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq k\) and must contain at least one element, `max_pairs_per_row` is \(4 \times n\), and `total_pairs_needed` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{\text{groups}[i] + 1}{2}\right)\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq k\). If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and a list of integers `groups`. It calculates the total number of pairs needed based on the values in `groups` using the formula \((\text{groups}[i] + 1) // 2\) for each element, sums these values to get `total_pairs_needed`, and compares this sum against `max_pairs_per_row`, which is \(4 \times n\). If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function accepts no parameters directly but reads them from standard input, and its final state includes the computed `total_pairs_needed` and the comparison result, printed as either 'YES' or 'NO'. Potential edge cases include when `groups` is empty or contains very large numbers within the specified range.
