Output State: **b is a non-negative integer, d is a non-negative integer, s is a non-negative integer, the printed value is max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)**

Explanation:
- The first line reads three space-separated non-negative integers from the input and assigns them to `b`, `d`, and `s` respectively.
- The second line prints the maximum value among `0`, `b - d`, `b - s`, and `d - s`.
- After running these lines, the values of `b`, `d`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the output of the program is determined by the calculation inside the `max()` function.
- Therefore, the final state includes the unchanged values of `b`, `d`, and `s`, and the printed value from the `max()` function.
