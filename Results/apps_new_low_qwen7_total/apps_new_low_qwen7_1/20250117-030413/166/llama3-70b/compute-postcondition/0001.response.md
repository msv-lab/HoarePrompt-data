The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions involving non-negative integers `b`, `d`, and `s` such that 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.

However, since no specific output conditions or return values are provided in the given output section, we cannot determine what the function specifically returns without additional information. 

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these integers `b`, `d`, and `s` in some way, but the exact nature of the processing and the return value are not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the non-negative integers b, d, and s such that 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.**
