The function reads three non-negative integers \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \) from the standard input, each constrained to the range \( 0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18} \) and \( b + d + s \geq 1 \). It then calculates and returns the maximum value among \( b - d \), \( b - s \), and \( d - s \). If any of these values are negative, the function returns 0 instead. This ensures that the returned value is always non-negative. Potential edge cases include when one or more of the inputs are zero, or when two or more inputs are equal, leading to possible zero differences.
