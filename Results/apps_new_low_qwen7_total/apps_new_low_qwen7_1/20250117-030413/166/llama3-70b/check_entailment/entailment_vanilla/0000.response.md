Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads three integers `b`, `d`, and `s` using `map(int, input().split())`. This matches the problem statement.
2. **Calculation of Missed Meals**: The program uses the `max` function with four arguments: `0`, `b - d`, `b - s`, and `d - s`.

   - `b - d` represents the potential missed suppers (since he had breakfast but not dinner).
   - `b - s` represents the potential missed dinners (since he had breakfast but not supper).
   - `d - s` represents the potential missed suppers (since he had dinner but not supper).

3. **Choosing the Minimum Missed Meals**:
   - If `b - d` is the maximum among these values, it means the maximum missed suppers.
   - If `b - s` is the maximum, it means the maximum missed dinners.
   - If `d - s` is the maximum, it means the maximum missed suppers again.
   - `0` ensures that if no meals can be missed, the result is zero.

4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum value from these calculations, which represents the minimum number of meals that could have been missed. This aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum possible number of meals missed.

Given the logic, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed.

Correctness: **True**
