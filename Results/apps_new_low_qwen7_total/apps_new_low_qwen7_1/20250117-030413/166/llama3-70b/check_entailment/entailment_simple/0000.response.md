Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program correctly calculates the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed.

### Analysis:

1. **Input and Constraints**: 
   - The input consists of three integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) representing the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers respectively.
   - These values are within the range \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\).

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed.
   - Meals can be missed on the day he arrived or the day he left, but not counted in the total \(b + d + s\).

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the input using `input().split()`.
   - It then uses the expression `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` to compute the result.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `b - d`: If Vasiliy missed a dinner after having a breakfast.
   - `b - s`: If Vasiliy missed a supper after having a breakfast.
   - `d - s`: If Vasiliy missed a supper after having a dinner.
   - `max(0, ... )`: Ensures that the result is non-negative (since the number of missed meals cannot be negative).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(b > d\), it means there were more breakfasts than dinners, implying a missed dinner.
   - If \(b > s\), it means there were more breakfasts than suppers, implying a missed supper.
   - If \(d > s\), it means there were more dinners than suppers, implying a missed supper.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 2 1`, the maximum missed meals would be \(1\) (a missed supper).
   - For the input `1 0 0`, no meals were missed, so the output is `0`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, no meals were missed, so the output is `0`.
   - For the input `1000000000000000000 0 1000000000000000000`, the maximum missed meals would be \(999999999999999999\) (a missed dinner and supper).

Given the analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly identifies the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed based on the provided constraints and examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of meals that could have been missed.
