Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed. For example, consider the input `1 0 0`. According to the problem description, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast and left after breakfast without having any dinner or supper, thus missing 2 meals. However, the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect. 

The program logic only considers the differences between the counts of each meal and does not account for the different arrival and departure scenarios properly. A correct solution would need to consider all possible arrival and departure times and calculate the minimum number of missed meals accordingly.
