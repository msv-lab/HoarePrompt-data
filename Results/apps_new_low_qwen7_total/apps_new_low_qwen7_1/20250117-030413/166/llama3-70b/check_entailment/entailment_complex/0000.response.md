Reasoning:
The provided annotated program correctly calculates the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed during his stay in the sanatorium. Here’s why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three non-negative integers `b`, `d`, and `s` from the standard input, ensuring they are within the specified constraints.
   
2. **Meal Calculation**:
   - `b - d`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and dinners.
   - `b - s`: The difference between the number of breakfasts and suppers.
   - `d - s`: The difference between the number of dinners and suppers.
   
   These differences indicate how many more meals of one type were taken compared to another type.

3. **Minimum Missed Meals**:
   - The `max(0, ...)` function ensures that any negative values (which would indicate that Vasiliy had more of one meal than another, but still within the bounds of his actual attendance) are set to 0. This means the function will return the smallest non-negative value among the differences, effectively giving the minimum number of meals he could have missed.
   - The logic here assumes that if Vasiliy missed a meal, it would be one where the count is less than another. For instance, if `b - d` is negative, it means he had more dinners than breakfasts, so he must have missed some breakfasts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `b = d = s`, the function will return 0 because no meal counts are more than others, indicating he didn’t miss any meals relative to the others.
   - When one of the counts is 0, the function correctly handles this by checking against the other non-zero counts.

Given this analysis, the program accurately computes the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed.

Correctness: **True**
