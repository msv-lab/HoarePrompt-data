You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation. 


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2 1

Output
1


Input
1 0 0

Output
0


Input
1 1 1

Output
0


Input
1000000000000000000 0 1000000000000000000

Output
999999999999999999





-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

- Program:
def func():
    (b, d, s) = map(int, input().split())
    max_meals = max(b, d, s)
    missed_b = max(0, max_meals - 1 - b)
    missed_d = max(0, max_meals - 1 - d)
    missed_s = max(0, max_meals - 1 - s)
    total_missed_meals = missed_b + missed_d + missed_s
    print(total_missed_meals)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads three non-negative integers \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \) from the input, where each integer is between 0 and \( 10^{18} \), inclusive, and their sum is at least 1. It then calculates the number of meals that could have been taken by each individual (represented by \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \)) but were missed due to constraints, assuming a maximum of one meal can be taken per individual. Specifically, it computes the number of missed meals for each individual as the maximum of zero and the difference between the maximum allowed meals (1) and the actual meals taken. Finally, it sums up the missed meals across all individuals and prints the total number of missed meals.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to understand its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vasiliy can arrive before any meal (breakfast, dinner, or supper).
   - He can leave after any meal.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of meals he could have missed.
   - He cannot miss any meal before he arrives or after he leaves.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads three integers `b`, `d`, and `s` representing the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers Vasiliy had.
   - It calculates the maximum number of meals (`max_meals`) among the three.
   - It then calculates the number of missed meals for each type of meal (`missed_b`, `missed_d`, `missed_s`) assuming he missed one less meal than the maximum possible (i.e., `max_meals - 1`).
   - Finally, it sums up the missed meals and prints the result.

3. **Analysis:**
   - If `b == max_meals`, then `missed_b = 0` because he did not miss any breakfasts.
   - Similarly, if `d == max_meals` or `s == max_meals`, then `missed_d` or `missed_s` will be 0.
   - If `b < max_meals`, then `missed_b = max_meals - 1 - b` (since he could have missed one less than the maximum possible).
   - The same logic applies to `d` and `s`.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `3 2 1`:
     - `max_meals = 3`
     - `missed_b = max(0, 3 - 1 - 3) = 0`
     - `missed_d = max(0, 3 - 1 - 2) = 0`
     - `missed_s = max(0, 3 - 1 - 1) = 1`
     - Total missed meals = `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b`, `d`, and `s` are all equal, then `missed_b`, `missed_d`, and `missed_s` will all be 0, resulting in a total of 0 missed meals, which is correct.

Given the logic and examples, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of missed meals.
