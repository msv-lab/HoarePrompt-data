Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where Vasiliy could have stayed in the sanatorium for multiple days without missing any meals, except for the possibility of arriving before breakfast or leaving after supper. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of missed meals.

For example, consider the input `3 2 1`. According to the problem description, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast and stayed for exactly two days, having one breakfast, two dinners, and one supper. In this case, he would have missed no meals, but the program incorrectly outputs `1` as the minimum number of missed meals.

The program should consider the following scenarios:
1. Arrival before breakfast: Vasiliy could have missed 0-1 breakfasts, 0-1 dinners, and 0-1 suppers.
2. Arrival before dinner: Vasiliy could have missed 0-1 dinners and 0-1 suppers.
3. Arrival before supper: Vasiliy could have missed 0-1 suppers.
4. Arrival after supper: Vasiliy could have missed 0-1 dinners and 0-1 suppers.

The correct approach is to calculate the minimum number of missed meals based on the maximum number of meals that could have been taken on any given day minus the actual number of meals taken on that day. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility of having multiple consecutive days without missing meals, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
