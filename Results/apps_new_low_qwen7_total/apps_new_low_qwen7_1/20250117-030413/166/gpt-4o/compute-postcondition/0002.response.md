Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \) from the input, where each integer is between 0 and \( 10^{18} \), inclusive, and their sum is at least 1. It then calculates the number of meals that could have been taken by each individual (represented by \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \)) but were missed due to constraints, assuming a maximum of one meal can be taken per individual. Specifically, it computes the number of missed meals for each individual as the maximum of zero and the difference between the maximum allowed meals (1) and the actual meals taken. Finally, it sums up the missed meals across all individuals and prints the total number of missed meals.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If any of \( b \), \( d \), or \( s \) is 0, the corresponding missed meals will be the maximum of zero and \( 1 - b \), \( 1 - d \), or \( 1 - s \), respectively.
- If any of \( b \), \( d \), or \( s \) is already 1, the corresponding missed meals will be zero since the maximum allowed meals (1) is met.
- If the sum of \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \) is less than 3, the function will still execute and compute the missed meals based on the actual values provided.

**Missing functionality:** The code does not validate the input to ensure that \( b \), \( d \), and \( s \) are indeed non-negative integers within the specified range. This should ideally be included to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
