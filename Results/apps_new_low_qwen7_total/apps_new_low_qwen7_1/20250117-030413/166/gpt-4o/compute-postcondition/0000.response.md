Output State: **b is a non-negative integer, d is a non-negative integer, s is a non-negative integer, max_meals is the maximum value among b, d, and s, missed_b is a non-negative integer, missed_d is a non-negative integer, missed_s is a non-negative integer, total_missed_meals is the sum of missed_b, missed_d, and missed_s, and the print statement outputs total_missed_meals**.

Explanation: The code reads three non-negative integers b, d, and s from the input, then calculates the maximum of these three values and stores it in the variable `max_meals`. It then computes the number of meals missed by each type (b, d, s) if the maximum number of meals minus one were to be taken. These values are stored in `missed_b`, `missed_d`, and `missed_s`, respectively. The total number of missed meals is calculated and stored in `total_missed_meals`. Finally, the code prints `total_missed_meals`. The initial values of `b`, `d`, and `s` are replaced by their input values, and new variables `max_meals`, `missed_b`, `missed_d`, `missed_s`, and `total_missed_meals` are introduced and updated accordingly.
