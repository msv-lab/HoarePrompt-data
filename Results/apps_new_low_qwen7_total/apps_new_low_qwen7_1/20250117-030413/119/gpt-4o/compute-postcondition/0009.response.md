The code snippet `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. The conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `t`, and the condition `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true. Printed output: 'YES'**
