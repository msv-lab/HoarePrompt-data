Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and reads three integers \( t \), \( s \), and \( x \) from standard input, where \( 0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq s \leq 10^9 \). It then checks several conditions to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically:

1. If \( x = t \), it prints 'YES'.
2. If \( x > t \):
   - If \( (x - t) \% s == 0 \), it prints 'YES'.
   - If \( (x - t - 1) \% s == 0 \) and \( x \neq t + 1 \), it also prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
3. If \( x < t \), it directly prints 'NO'.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be such that it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated, and the variables \( t \), \( s \), and \( x \) remain unchanged.**

This summary includes all the conditions checked by the code and covers all potential outcomes, including the edge case where \( x = t \) and the condition \( (x - t - 1) \% s == 0 \) and \( x \neq t + 1 \).
