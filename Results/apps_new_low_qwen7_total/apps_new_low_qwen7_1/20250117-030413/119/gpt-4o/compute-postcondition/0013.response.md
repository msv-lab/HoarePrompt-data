Postcondition: ***`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. If `(x - t) % s == 0` is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true, the program also prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.***
