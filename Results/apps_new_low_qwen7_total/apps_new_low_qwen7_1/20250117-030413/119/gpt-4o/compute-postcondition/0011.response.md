The code snippet prints 'NO', but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. The print statement itself does not change any variable values or states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `t`. It is not the case that ((`x` - `t` - 1) % `s` == 0 and `x` != `t` + 1); printed output: NO**
