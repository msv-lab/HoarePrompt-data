The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^9, `s` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, `x` is equal to `t`, and the console displays 'YES'**
