The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints where `t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, we cannot specify what the function returns based on those constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
