The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. The states of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t` and `x` is less than or equal to `t`; the program prints 'NO'**
