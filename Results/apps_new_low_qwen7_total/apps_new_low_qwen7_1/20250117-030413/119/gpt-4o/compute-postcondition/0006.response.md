The `print('YES')` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `s`, and `x`. It only prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. The current value of `x` is greater than `t`, and `(x - t)` is divisible by `s`. The program prints 'YES'**.
