The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `t`, `s`, and `x` respectively. Since the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, they remain as variables until input is provided. However, the constraints on `t`, `s`, and `x` are known. After the code executes, `t`, `s`, and `x` will hold the values provided by the input, while the constraints on their values are preserved.

Output State: **`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, and their specific values are determined by the input**
