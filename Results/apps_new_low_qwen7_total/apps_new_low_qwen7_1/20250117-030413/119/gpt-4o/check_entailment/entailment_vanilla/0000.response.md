### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step by step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `s`, and `x` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `x == t`, the program immediately prints 'YES', which is incorrect according to the problem statement. It should print 'NO' because the pineapple hasn't started barking yet at time `t`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program checks if `(x - t)` is divisible by `s`. This correctly identifies whether `x` falls on a bark time if the pineapple has already started barking.
   - The additional check `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1` is redundant and unnecessary. The main logic should be sufficient to determine if `x` is a bark time.

4. **Time Boundary Handling**:
   - The condition `x > t` ensures we don't need to handle the case where `x < t` separately, as the program already handles this by printing 'NO'.

Given these points, let's fix the edge case for `x == t` and ensure the logic remains clear and concise.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('NO')
    elif (x - t) % s == 0 or ((x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

### Final Answer:

**Correctness: False**

The original program incorrectly prints 'YES' when `x == t`, which is not correct according to the problem statement. The corrected version should print 'NO' in this case.
