You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

- Program: 
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('YES')
    elif x > t:
        if (x - t) % s == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif (x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t, s, and x are integers such that 0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t, s, x = map(int, input().split())
    if (x == t) :
        print('YES')

        if (x > t) :
            if ((x - t) % s == 0) :

                if ((x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1) :
                    print('YES')
                else :
                    print('NO')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. If the condition `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. If `(x - t) % s == 0` is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true, the program also prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, with `x` not equal to `t`. The program prints 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`t`, `s`, and `x` are integers such that 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9. If `x` equals `t`, the console displays 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and reads three integers \( t \), \( s \), and \( x \) from standard input, where \( 0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq s \leq 10^9 \). It then checks several conditions to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically:

1. If \( x = t \), it prints 'YES'.
2. If \( x > t \):
   - If \( (x - t) \% s == 0 \), it prints 'YES'.
   - If \( (x - t - 1) \% s == 0 \) and \( x \neq t + 1 \), it also prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
3. If \( x < t \), it directly prints 'NO'.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be such that it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated, and the variables \( t \), \( s \), and \( x \) remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `x` is equal to `t + 1`. According to the problem description, the pineapple barks at times `t`, `t + s`, `t + s + 1`, `t + 2s`, etc. Therefore, if `x` is `t + 1`, the pineapple should bark. However, the program checks for `(x - t) % s == 0` and `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` but does not consider the case where `x == t + 1`. For example, if the input is `(3, 10, 4)`, the program outputs 'NO' instead of 'YES', which is incorrect according to the problem description.
