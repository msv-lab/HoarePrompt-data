Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine its correctness.

1. The program correctly handles the case where `x` equals `t`. In this case, it should print 'YES' because the pineapple barks at time `t`.

2. For `x > t`, the program checks if `(x - t)` is a multiple of `s` or if `(x - t - 1)` is a multiple of `s` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`. These checks are designed to see if `x` falls on one of the barking times.

   - If `(x - t) % s == 0`, it means `x` is exactly at one of the barking times (either the start or end of a barking period).
   - If `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x != t + 1`, it means `x` is just after the end of a barking period, which still qualifies as barking according to the problem statement.

3. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'NO', indicating `x` is not a barking time.

4. The program correctly handles the case where `x < t` by printing 'NO' immediately, as the pineapple hasn't started barking yet.

Based on this analysis, the program's logic matches the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
