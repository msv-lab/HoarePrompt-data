Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

If the condition `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

If `(x - t) % s == 0` is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true, the program also prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.

            print('NO')

The program prints 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.

Otherwise, the program prints 'YES' if either `(x - t) % s == 0` or `(x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1` holds true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
