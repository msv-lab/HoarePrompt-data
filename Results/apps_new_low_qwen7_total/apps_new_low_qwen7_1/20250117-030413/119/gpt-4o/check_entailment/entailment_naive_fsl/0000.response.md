Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `x` is equal to `t + 1`. According to the problem description, the pineapple barks at times `t`, `t + s`, `t + s + 1`, `t + 2s`, etc. Therefore, if `x` is `t + 1`, the pineapple should bark. However, the program checks for `(x - t) % s == 0` and `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` but does not consider the case where `x == t + 1`. For example, if the input is `(3, 10, 4)`, the program outputs 'NO' instead of 'YES', which is incorrect according to the problem description.
