Postcondition: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`, then the function continues without changing the state of `t`, `n`, and `i`. Otherwise, the function does not change the state of `t`, `n`, and `i`.**
