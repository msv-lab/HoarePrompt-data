Output State: The string `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `t`, and `i` reaches the value of `n`. The function will return 'YES\n' followed by a substring of `t` if there exists an index `i` such that `t[:i]` is equal to `t[-i:]` for all iterations up to `n-1`. If no such index is found, the function will return nothing (i.e., it will exit without returning any value).

To summarize:
- **Invariant Variables**: `t`, `n`.
- **Final Values**: `i` equals `n`.
- **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if the prefix of `t` of length `i` is equal to the suffix of `t` of length `i`. If this condition is met, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring `t[:-i]` and stops. If the condition is not met for any `i`, the function exits without returning anything.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `i` is `n`. The function will return 'YES\n' followed by a substring of `t` if there exists an index `i` such that `t[:i]` is equal to `t[-i:]` for all iterations up to `n-1`. Otherwise, the function returns nothing.
