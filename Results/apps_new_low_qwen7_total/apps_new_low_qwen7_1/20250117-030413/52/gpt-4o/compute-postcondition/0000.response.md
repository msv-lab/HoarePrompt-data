The code `n = len(t)` calculates the length of the string `t` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length does not exceed 100 characters, `n` will be an integer representing the length of `t`. The state of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of the string does not exceed 100 characters; `n` is the length of `t`**
