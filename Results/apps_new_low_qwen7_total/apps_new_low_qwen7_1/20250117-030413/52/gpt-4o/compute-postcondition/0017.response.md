Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3. If the substring `t[:3]` is equal to the substring `t[-3:]`, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring `t[:3]`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
