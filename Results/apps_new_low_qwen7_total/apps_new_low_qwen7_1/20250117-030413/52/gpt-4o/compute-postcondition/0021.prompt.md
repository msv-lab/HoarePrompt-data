You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of the string does not exceed 100 characters.
def func_1(t):
    n = len(t)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if t[:i] == t[-i:]:
            s = t[:-i]
            if s + t[-i:] == t:
                return 'YES\n' + s
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: The string `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `t`, and `i` reaches the value of `n`. The function will return 'YES\n' followed by a substring of `t` if there exists an index `i` such that `t[:i]` is equal to `t[-i:]` for all iterations up to `n-1`. If no such index is found, the function will return nothing (i.e., it will exit without returning any value).
    #
    #To summarize:
    #- **Invariant Variables**: `t`, `n`.
    #- **Final Values**: `i` equals `n`.
    #- **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if the prefix of `t` of length `i` is equal to the suffix of `t` of length `i`. If this condition is met, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring `t[:-i]` and stops. If the condition is not met for any `i`, the function exits without returning anything.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state is:
    #Output State: `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `i` is `n`. The function will return 'YES\n' followed by a substring of `t` if there exists an index `i` such that `t[:i]` is equal to `t[-i:]` for all iterations up to `n-1`. Otherwise, the function returns nothing.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of the string does not exceed 100 characters. The function can return one of the following:
#
#- Case_1: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t`.
#- Case_2: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` excluding its last two characters.
#- Case_3: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring of `t` from the start to the position before the last three characters.
#- Case_4: The function returns 'NO'.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `t` and return either 'YES\n' followed by a part of `t` or 'NO', based on specific conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: 'YES\n' + s

Case_2: `YES\n` followed by the string `t` excluding its last two characters

Case_3: `The program returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring of 't' from the start to the position before the last three characters`

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
