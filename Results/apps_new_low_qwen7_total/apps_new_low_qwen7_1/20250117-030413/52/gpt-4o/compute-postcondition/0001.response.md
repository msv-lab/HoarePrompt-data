State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The `for` loop starts with `i` from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `i` should be `1` and `n` should be greater than `1`.
3. **Initial Values**: Given that `t` is a non-empty string, the length `n` of `t` must be at least `1`. However, for the loop to execute even once, `n` must be greater than `1`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the initial state such that `n` is greater than `1` and `i` is set to `1`.

### Justification:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the loop will not execute at all because the range function will not generate any values for `i`.
- Setting `i` to `1` ensures that the loop starts its first iteration immediately.

Therefore, the required state before the loop is:
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than `1`.
- `i` is `1`.

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
