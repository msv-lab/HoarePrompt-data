Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the substring of `t` from the beginning to the position before the last 3 characters. If `s + t[-i:] == t`, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the substring `s`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the condition is not met).***
