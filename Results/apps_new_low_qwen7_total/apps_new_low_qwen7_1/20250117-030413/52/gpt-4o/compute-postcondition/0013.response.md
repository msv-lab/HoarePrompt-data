Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of Variables:**
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 (since the loop increments `i` by default).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of `t`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as no operation is performed inside the loop that modifies `t`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `t` is still a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is still the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3**.
