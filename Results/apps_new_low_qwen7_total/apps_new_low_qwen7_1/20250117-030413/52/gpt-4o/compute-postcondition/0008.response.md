Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Loop execution condition**: The loop continues if `i` is less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the length of the string `t` and that value does not change within the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged because the problem statement specifies that the state of `t` is not changed unless the first character equals the last character, which is not specified to happen in this case.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
