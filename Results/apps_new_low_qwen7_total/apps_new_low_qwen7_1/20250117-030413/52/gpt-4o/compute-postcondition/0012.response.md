Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the first two characters of `t` are equal to the last two characters of `t`, the function prints `YES\n` followed by the string `t` excluding its last two characters. Otherwise, no change occurs to the program variables.***
