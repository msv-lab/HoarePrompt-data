The code `s = t[:-i]` creates a new string `s` by slicing the string `t` from the beginning up to the character just before the `i`-th character from the end of `t`. Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
- `n` is the length of `t`, and `n` must be greater than 1,
- `i` is 1,
- the first character of `t` is equal to the last character of `t`.

Since `i` is 1, the slice `t[:-i]` effectively removes the last character of `t`. Thus, `s` will be the string `t` without its last character.

Given these conditions, the output state is:
- `t` remains unchanged because the slice operation does not modify `t` itself, it only creates a new string `s`.
- `s` is the string `t` without its last character.
- `n` remains the same since the length of `t` does not change (it's still `n`).
- `i` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is `t` without its last character.**
