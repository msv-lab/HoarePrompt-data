`s` is assigned the value of `t[:-i]`, which means `s` is the substring of `t` from the beginning to the position before the last 3 characters. Since `n` is the length of `t` and `i` is 3, `s` will exclude the last 3 characters of `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the substring of `t` from the beginning to the position before the last 3 characters.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 3; `s` is the substring of `t` from the beginning to the position before the last 3 characters.**
