`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` (and `n` must be greater than 1), and `i` is 2. The code `s = t[:-i]` creates a new string `s` that consists of all characters in `t` except the last two characters.

- The original string `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` (the length of `t`) also remains unchanged because the code does not modify `t` or `n`.
- The value of `i` remains 2 because the code does not modify `i`.
- A new string `s` is created with the value of `t` excluding the last two characters.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2; `s` is `t` excluding the last two characters.**
