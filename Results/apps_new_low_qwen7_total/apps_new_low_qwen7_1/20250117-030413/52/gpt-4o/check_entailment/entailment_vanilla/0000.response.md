Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine if a received message `t` can be a result of an error in the local network, where two identical messages might merge into one due to overlapping. The program correctly implements the logic to check for such an overlap.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `t` and strips any leading/trailing spaces.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through possible prefixes and suffixes of the string `t`.
   - For each prefix length `i`, it checks if the prefix matches the suffix of the same length.
   - If a match is found, it constructs a potential original message `s` by removing the matching suffix from `t`.
   - It then checks if concatenating `s` with the matching suffix equals the original message `t`. If so, it returns "YES" followed by the potential original message `s`.
3. **Output Handling**: If no such overlap is found, it returns "NO".

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies if the message could have resulted from an error and provides the possible original message if it exists.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the implementation in the program matches the requirements perfectly. The program handles all the cases correctly and does not produce any errors as per the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
