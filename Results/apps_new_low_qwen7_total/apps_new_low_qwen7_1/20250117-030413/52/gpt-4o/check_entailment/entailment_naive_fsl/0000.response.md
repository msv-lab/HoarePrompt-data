Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not check for the case where the entire string `t` could be the result of merging two identical messages without any overlap. This means that if the entire string is a repetition of a substring (like "abcabc"), the program incorrectly outputs "NO" instead of "YES".

For example, consider the input "abcabc":
- The program should output "YES" because "abcabc" can be formed by merging "abc" and "abc".
- However, the current implementation checks for overlaps only at the beginning and end of the string and does not account for the possibility of the entire string being a repeated substring.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect verdict.
