Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to check if a given string `t` can result from a network error described in the problem statement, where two identical messages get merged into one if their trailing parts match the leading parts of the other message.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes a single non-empty string `t` as input, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a maximum length of 100 characters.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function iterates over possible suffix lengths (`i`) from 1 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string `t`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if the prefix of `t` of length `i` is equal to the suffix of `t` of length `i`.
   - If such a match is found, it returns `YES` followed by the substring of `t` from the start to the position just before the matched suffix (`t[:-i]`).
   - If no such match is found, the function returns `NO`.

3. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - The function handles the case where the entire string might be a repeated sequence (`abcabc` should return `NO` as it is not due to a merge error).
   - It also correctly identifies cases where merging can occur, like `abrakadabrabrakadabra` (should return `YES` with `abrakadabra`).

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program calls `func_1(t)` and prints its return value directly.
   - If `func_1` returns `YES` followed by a substring, the program prints it accordingly.
   - If `func_1` returns `NO`, the program prints `NO`.

5. **Consistency with Problem Description**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether a given string `t` can result from the described merging error.
   - It handles all test cases provided, including edge cases and examples.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all specified scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
