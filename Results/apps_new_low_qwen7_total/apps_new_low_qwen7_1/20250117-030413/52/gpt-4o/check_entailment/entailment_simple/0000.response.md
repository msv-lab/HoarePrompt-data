Reasoning:

1. The goal is to check if the given string \( t \) can be the result of merging two identical messages with some overlap (i.e., part of one message overlaps with the start of another message due to a network error).

2. The provided solution involves iterating over possible lengths of overlap and checking if the string can be split into two identical parts with an overlap of at least one character.

3. In the `func_1` function:
   - The function iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) where \( n \) is the length of the string \( t \).
   - For each \( i \), it checks if the prefix of length \( i \) (`t[:i]`) is equal to the suffix of length \( i \) (`t[-i:]`).
   - If such an \( i \) is found, it constructs the original message by removing the overlapping part and returns `'YES\n'` followed by the resulting string.
   - If no such \( i \) is found, the function returns `'NO'`.

4. This logic correctly identifies if the string \( t \) can be formed by merging two identical messages with an overlap. It also handles edge cases such as no overlap and complete overlap (where one message is a full substring of the other).

5. The function properly outputs `'YES\n'` followed by the possible original message if an overlap is found, and `'NO'` otherwise.

Given the provided test cases, the implementation seems to handle various scenarios correctly. There are no logical errors or missing conditions that would lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
