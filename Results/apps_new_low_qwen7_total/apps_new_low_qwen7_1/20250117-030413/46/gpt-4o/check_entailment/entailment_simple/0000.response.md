Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Validation**: The annotated program correctly checks if the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers can be formed from `n`. This is done by calculating `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum > n`, it correctly returns `-1`.

2. **GCD Maximization**: The next step is to maximize the GCD of the sequence. The approach taken is to start with the smallest possible values and increment them until the total sum equals `n`. Specifically, the sequence is initialized as `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, where `d = n // min_sum`. This sets the initial values in the sequence to be as small as possible while still allowing for the GCD to be maximized.

3. **Adjustments for Exact Sum**: After initializing the sequence, the program iterates backward through the sequence, incrementing each element until the total sum matches `n`. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and that the exact sum `n` is achieved.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the program returns the constructed sequence, which should meet all the conditions stated in the problem description.

Given this analysis, the provided code logic appears to be correct for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
