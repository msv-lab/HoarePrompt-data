Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the edge case where the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers is greater than `n` by returning `-1` when this condition is met.
2. The calculation of the GCD factor `d` is appropriate because `d * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` must be less than or equal to `n`.
3. The initial sequence `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]` ensures that the sequence starts with the smallest possible values and increases strictly.
4. The loop that adjusts the sequence elements by decrementing the remainder ensures that the final sum of the sequence equals `n` while maintaining the strictly increasing property.
5. The approach guarantees that the sequence will have the maximum possible GCD because each element in the sequence is a multiple of `d`.

Given these points, the provided code logically implements the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.
