Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided solution meets the requirements of the problem statement. However, let's re-evaluate the solution to ensure there are no hidden pitfalls or edge cases that might not be fully addressed.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `(n, k) = map(int, input().split())` correctly parses the input.

2. **Function Call**:
   - `result = func_1(n, k)` calls the function to generate the sequence.

3. **Handling No Solution Case**:
   - `if result == -1: print(-1)` correctly handles the case where no valid sequence can be formed.

4. **Function Implementation** (`func_1`):
   - **Minimum Sum Check**:
     ```python
     min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
     if min_sum > n:
         return -1
     ```
     This checks if the minimum sum of the smallest `k` numbers exceeds `n`, which is correct.

   - **GCD Initialization**:
     ```python
     d = n // min_sum
     remainder = n - d * min_sum
     ```
     Here, `d` is set to the initial GCD candidate, and `remainder` calculates the leftover value after distributing `d`.

   - **Sequence Generation**:
     ```python
     sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
     ```
     This initializes the sequence with the smallest values that could have GCD `d`.

   - **Adjustments for Remainder**:
     ```python
     for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
         if remainder == 0:
             break
         sequence[i] += 1
         remainder -= 1
     ```
     This loop adjusts the sequence elements to account for the remainder, ensuring all elements are strictly increasing.

### Detailed Edge Case Analysis:
- **Small Values of `k`**:
  - When `k` is small, the sequence generation logic needs to be thoroughly tested.
  - For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the expected output should be `1 6` because the minimum sum for `k=2` is `3` (1+2), and the maximum GCD is `1`, but the sequence `1 6` has a GCD of `1` and sums to `7`.
  - The current implementation fails to generate this sequence correctly.

- **Large Values of `k`**:
  - When `k` is large, the minimum sum increases significantly, and the adjustment for the remainder must handle larger sequences correctly.
  - For example, when `n = 100` and `k = 10`, the expected output should be `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 35` because the minimum sum for `k=10` is `55`, and the GCD is maximized to `1`.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 2 3`
  - Correctly generated.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `8 2`
  - Expected Output: `2 6`
  - Correctly generated.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `5 3`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Correctly handled.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `7 2`
  - Expected Output: `1 6`
  - Not correctly generated.

### Conclusion:
While the provided solution works for some test cases, it fails for certain edge cases where the sequence needs to be adjusted to fit the exact sum `n` while maintaining the strictly increasing property and maximizing the GCD. Therefore, the solution is not fully correct.

Final: **False**
