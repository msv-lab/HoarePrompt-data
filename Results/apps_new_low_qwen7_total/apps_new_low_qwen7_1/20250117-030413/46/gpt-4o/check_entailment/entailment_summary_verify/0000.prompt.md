You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first checks if the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers (which is \(k \cdot (k + 1) / 2\)) can be achieved or not. If not, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) factor `d` such that \(d \cdot (k \cdot (k + 1) / 2) \leq n\), and computes the initial sequence of `k` integers as `d * (i + 1)` for \(i\) in range `k`. Then, it adjusts the sequence elements to ensure the total sum equals `n` by incrementing elements from the end until the remainder (`remainder`) becomes zero. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence of integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the GCD of the sequence is indeed maximized. 

For example, consider the input:
```
10 3
```
The program will output:
```
1 2 7
```
However, the GCD of the sequence [1, 2, 7] is 1, which is not necessarily the maximum possible GCD. A better solution would be [2, 4, 4], which has a GCD of 2.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to calculate the maximum possible GCD and construct the sequence accordingly. The current implementation only checks if the minimum sum condition is met and does not ensure the GCD is maximized.
