Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

# Annotated Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to n
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = -1, k is a non-negative integer, sequence is an array where each element is incremented by its index-based value up to the point where remainder becomes 0, and remainder = 0.
    return sequence
    #The program returns an array `sequence` where each element is incremented by its index-based value up to the point where remainder becomes 0, and initially `i` is -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first checks if the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers (which is \(k \cdot (k + 1) / 2\)) can be achieved or not. If not, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) factor `d` such that \(d \cdot (k \cdot (k + 1) / 2) \leq n\), and computes the initial sequence of `k` integers as `d * (i + 1)` for \(i\) in range `k`. Then, it adjusts the sequence elements to ensure the total sum equals `n` by incrementing elements from the end until the remainder (`remainder`) becomes zero. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence of integers.
