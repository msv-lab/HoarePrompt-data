Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the edge case where the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers is greater than `n`. In this case, it returns `-1`, which is the correct behavior as specified in the problem statement.

2. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) factor `d` such that `d * (k * (k + 1) // 2) <= n`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is at most `n`.

3. The initial sequence is created as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, which gives the sequence `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`.

4. The program then adjusts the sequence to ensure the total sum exactly equals `n` by incrementing elements from the end of the sequence. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the sum of the sequence equals `n`.

5. The function logic seems to cover all the necessary steps to find a valid sequence or return `-1` if no valid sequence exists. 

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
