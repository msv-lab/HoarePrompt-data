Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the GCD of the sequence is indeed maximized. 

For example, consider the input:
```
10 3
```
The program will output:
```
1 2 7
```
However, the GCD of the sequence [1, 2, 7] is 1, which is not necessarily the maximum possible GCD. A better solution would be [2, 4, 4], which has a GCD of 2.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to calculate the maximum possible GCD and construct the sequence accordingly. The current implementation only checks if the minimum sum condition is met and does not ensure the GCD is maximized.
