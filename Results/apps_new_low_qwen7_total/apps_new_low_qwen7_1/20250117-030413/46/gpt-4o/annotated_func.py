#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to n
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = -1, k is a non-negative integer, sequence is an array where each element is incremented by its index-based value up to the point where remainder becomes 0, and remainder = 0.
    return sequence
    #The program returns an array `sequence` where each element is incremented by its index-based value up to the point where remainder becomes 0, and initially `i` is -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first checks if the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers (which is \(k \cdot (k + 1) / 2\)) can be achieved or not. If not, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) factor `d` such that \(d \cdot (k \cdot (k + 1) / 2) \leq n\), and computes the initial sequence of `k` integers as `d * (i + 1)` for \(i\) in range `k`. Then, it adjusts the sequence elements to ensure the total sum equals `n` by incrementing elements from the end until the remainder (`remainder`) becomes zero. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence of integers.
