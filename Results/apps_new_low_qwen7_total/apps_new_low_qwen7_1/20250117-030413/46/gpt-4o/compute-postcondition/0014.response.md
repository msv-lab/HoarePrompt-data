Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k - 2`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 1.
   - `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `k - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2` and `k` is unchanged (since it's not modified in the loop).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `k - 1`.
   - `k` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `sequence` and `remainder` remain as they are because the loop body is omitted and we don't know what modifications might occur inside the loop body if provided.

5. **State the updated state**: Based on the above adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1**.
