Initial State: `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `sequence` is an array (list) that contains at least `k` elements.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line increments the value of `sequence[i]` by 1. Here, `i` is `k - 1`.
- The second line decreases `remainder` by 1.

Since the exact initial value of `remainder` is not specified, we will keep it as a general non-negative integer minus 1 after this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1**.
