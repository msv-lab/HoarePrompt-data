The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement active when the `break` statement is encountered, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the most internal loop or conditional statement we were in.

Given the initial state where `i` is `k - 1` and `k` is a non-negative integer, and the remainder is 0, the `break` statement does not alter these values.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and the remainder is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
