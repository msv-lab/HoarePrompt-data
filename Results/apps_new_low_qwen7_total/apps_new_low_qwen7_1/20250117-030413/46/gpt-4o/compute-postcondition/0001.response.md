Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2. The current value of `min_sum` is greater than n***
