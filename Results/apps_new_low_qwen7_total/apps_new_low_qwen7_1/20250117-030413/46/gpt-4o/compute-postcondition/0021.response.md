Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). It first checks if the minimum possible sum of `k` positive integers (which is \(k \cdot (k + 1) / 2\)) can be achieved or not. If not, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) factor `d` such that \(d \cdot (k \cdot (k + 1) / 2) \leq n\), and computes the initial sequence of `k` integers as `d * (i + 1)` for \(i\) in range `k`. Then, it adjusts the sequence elements to ensure the total sum equals `n` by incrementing elements from the end until the remainder (`remainder`) becomes zero. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence of integers.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the conditions for `min_sum` are not met, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- If the conditions are met, the function correctly computes the initial sequence and adjusts it to meet the sum requirement.
- The function ensures that the sum of the resulting sequence equals `n` and maintains the strictly increasing property.
- There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
