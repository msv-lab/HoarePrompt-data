Initial State: `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1. If `remainder` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line increases the element at index `i` (which is `k - 1`) in the `sequence` array by 1. Since `i` is `k - 1`, the element at index `k - 2` in the `sequence` array will be incremented by 1.
- The second line decreases the value of `remainder` by 1.

Final Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 2 (previously increased by 1 and then increased by 1 again), and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 2**.
