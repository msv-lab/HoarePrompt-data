Initial State: `i` is `k - 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1. If `remainder` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
- The first line `sequence[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` in the `sequence` array by 1. Since `i` is `k - 2`, it increments the element at index `k - 2`.
- The second line `remainder -= 1` decrements the `remainder` by 1.

Given the initial conditions and the operations performed by the code, the following updates occur:
- The element at index `k - 2` in the `sequence` array is incremented by 1.
- The `remainder` is decremented by 1.

If `remainder` equals 0, the loop or condition would be exited, but since no loop or condition is specified in the given code block, we assume the code executes these two lines once without further iteration based on `remainder`.

Final Output State: **`i` is `k - 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1.**
