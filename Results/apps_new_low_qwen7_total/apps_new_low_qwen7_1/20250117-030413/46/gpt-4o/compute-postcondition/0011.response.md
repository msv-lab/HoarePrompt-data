The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is in. Since there is no loop or conditional block directly referenced in the provided code snippet, the only impact is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block it is in. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k - 2`
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1
- `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1

Since the `break` statement is executed, we indicate that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1, `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
