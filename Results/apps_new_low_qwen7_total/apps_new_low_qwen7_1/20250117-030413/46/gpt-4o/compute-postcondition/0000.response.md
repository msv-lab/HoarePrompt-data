The code initializes the variable `min_sum` with the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This value is the minimum possible sum of the first `k` positive integers. Since `n` and `k` are non-negative integers with specific constraints and the initial sequence is not altered, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_sum` and the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers whose sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized; `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2**
