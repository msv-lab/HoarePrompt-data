The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `sequence`, and `remainder`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 2` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
