Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `k` as part of the range definition. Specifically, the loop runs from `k-1` down to `0`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop starts at `k-1` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `i` becomes less than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k - 1`
   - `k` is a non-negative integer
   - `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1
   - `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 2`.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop itself but used to define the range.
   - `sequence` and `remainder` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `k - 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sequence` is an array where the element at index `k - 1` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1**
