The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\) and there exists a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized. 

- Case_1: If the conditions are not met, the function returns `-1`.
- Case_2: If the conditions are met, the function returns an array `sequence` where each element is incremented by its index-based value up to the point where the remainder becomes 0, and initially `i` is `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and if the specified conditions are satisfied, it returns an array `sequence` with specific increments. If the conditions are not met, it returns `-1`.
