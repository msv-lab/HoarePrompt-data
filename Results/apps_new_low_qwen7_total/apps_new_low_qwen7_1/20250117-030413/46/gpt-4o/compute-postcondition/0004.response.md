The initial state is defined by the conditions that `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\), there exists a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor of these integers is maximized, and `min_sum` is \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\), which is less than or equal to `n`.

The code snippet is:
```
d = n // min_sum
remainder = n - d * min_sum
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Line 1: `d = n // min_sum`**
   - This line calculates `d` as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`.
   - Since `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` will be approximately `n / min_sum`.

2. **Line 2: `remainder = n - d * min_sum`**
   - This line calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `min_sum`.
   - The remainder will be the difference between `n` and the product of `d` and `min_sum`.

3. **Line 3: `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`**
   - This line creates a list called `sequence` where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`.
   - So, `sequence` will contain the elements `[d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]`.

Now, let's combine these effects to determine the final state:

- The variable `d` is set to `n // min_sum`.
- The variable `remainder` is set to `n - d * min_sum`.
- The variable `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]`.

Given the initial conditions and the operations performed, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum, sequence is [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]**
