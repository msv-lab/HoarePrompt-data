Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the required states for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `k`: The upper bound of the loop, which is also a parameter to the loop.
   
2. **Determine the Initial Condition for `i`:**
   The loop starts with `i` in the range `k - 1` to `-1` (inclusive), decrementing by `-1`. Therefore, the first iteration will start with `i = k - 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the specified range. Since the loop starts with `i = k - 1` and iterates until `i = -1`, the loop will execute as long as `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The condition `k - 1 ≥ -1` simplifies to `k ≥ 0`, which is already satisfied since `k` is defined as a non-negative integer.

4. **State Before Loop Execution:**
   - `n` and `k` are non-negative integers with \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\).
   - `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
   - `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.
   - `sequence` is `[d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]`.

5. **Initial State for the First Iteration:**
   - The first iteration requires `i = k - 1` to be valid.
   - No additional conditions are necessary for the initial state of other variables since they are derived from the given conditions and do not affect the loop's initial execution.

**Conclusion:**

For the loop to execute the first time, the following must hold true:
- `i` must be `k - 1`.
- `k` must be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state before the first execution of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer**
