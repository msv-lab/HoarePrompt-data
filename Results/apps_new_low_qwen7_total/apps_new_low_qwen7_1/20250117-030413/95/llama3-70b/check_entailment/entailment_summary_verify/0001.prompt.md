You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function converts a string `k`, which represents a number in a base-`n` numeral system, into its decimal (base-10) equivalent and prints the result. The function accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is less than `n` and `k` does not contain leading zeros. After executing the function, the program will have converted `k` from base `n` to decimal and printed the decimal value `x`. The function handles the case where `k` might have leading zeros by ignoring them during the conversion process. However, it does not handle the case where `k` might be empty; in such a scenario, the function would incorrectly treat `x` as 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The task is to convert a number `k` from an arbitrary base `n` back to its decimal representation.
   - The number `k` is given in a non-standard format where digits are represented in the usual way but can be interpreted as if they were digits in base `n`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from standard input.
   - It initializes `x` to 0.
   - It iterates over each character in `k` starting from the least significant digit (reversed using `reversed(k)`).
   - For each character `c` at position `i`, it converts `c` to an integer and multiplies it by `n^i`, adding this product to `x`.
   - Finally, it prints `x`.

3. **Checking the Conversion Logic**:
   - The logic used in the program correctly interprets the positional value of each digit in the number `k` when converted from base `n` to decimal.
   - The formula used in the loop `x += int(c) * n ** i` is the standard formula for converting a number from a given base to decimal.
   - The loop iterates through each digit from right to left, which corresponds to increasing powers of `n`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement (0 ≤ k < 10^60, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is within the range 0 to 10^18).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the program correctly implements the conversion logic from base `n` to decimal, and there are no logical errors or constraints violations, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
