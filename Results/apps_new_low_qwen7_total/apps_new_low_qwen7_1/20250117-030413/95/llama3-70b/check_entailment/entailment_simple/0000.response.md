Reasoning:

The annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic for converting a number from a base-n numeral system to the decimal (base-10) system. Here's a breakdown of the steps and why they are correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads an integer `n` which represents the base of the numeral system.
   - `k = input()`: Reads a string `k` which represents a number in base `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `x = 0`: Initializes a variable `x` to store the decimal equivalent of the base-n number.

3. **Loop through Digits:**
   - The `for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):` loop reverses the string `k` and iterates over its characters along with their indices.
   - `x += int(c) * n ** i`: For each character `c`, converts it to an integer and multiplies it by `n` raised to the power of the index `i`. This correctly adds the value of each digit in the base-n number to the total decimal value `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - `print(x)`: Prints the final decimal value of the base-n number.

Given that the program follows the correct algorithm for converting a number from a given base to decimal, and there are no logical errors or issues in the code, the program should work as intended under the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
