Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from a given base `n` back to its decimal form. The program iterates over each digit of the input string `k`, reverses it, and calculates the decimal value by summing up each digit multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its position index. Since the problem guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed \(10^{18}\), and the program handles all valid inputs as per the problem description, it works correctly for all potential cases.
