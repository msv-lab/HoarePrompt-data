You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
12

Output
12
Input
16
11311

Output
475
Input
20
999

Output
3789
Input
17
2016

Output
594


-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is less than n and k does not contain leading zeros.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = input()

x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function converts a string `k`, which represents a number in a base-`n` numeral system, into its decimal (base-10) equivalent and prints the result. The function accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is less than `n` and `k` does not contain leading zeros. After executing the function, the program will have converted `k` from base `n` to decimal and printed the decimal value `x`. The function handles the case where `k` might have leading zeros by ignoring them during the conversion process. However, it does not handle the case where `k` might be empty; in such a scenario, the function would incorrectly treat `x` as 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from a given base `n` back to its decimal form. The program iterates over each digit of the input string `k`, reverses it, and calculates the decimal value by summing up each digit multiplied by `n` raised to the power of its position index. Since the problem guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed \(10^{18}\), and the program handles all valid inputs as per the problem description, it works correctly for all potential cases.
