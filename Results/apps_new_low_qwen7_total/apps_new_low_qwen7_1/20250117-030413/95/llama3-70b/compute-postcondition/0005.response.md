Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `c`.

2. **Understand the initial state:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`.
   - `x` is calculated as `int(c) * (n + n)`, but since this calculation does not depend on the loop iteration, it does not need to be adjusted.

3. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters in the reversed string `k` using `enumerate(reversed(k))`.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be more characters in the reversed string `k` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - `i` is incremented with each iteration, starting from the last character of `k` and moving towards the first.
   - `c` is the current character being processed in the loop.
   - Since `k` is reversed, the first character of the original `k` will be the last character in the reversed `k`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, if there are more characters in `k`, the next character in the reversed `k` will be used.
   - Therefore, `i` will be decreased by 1 (since `enumerate` starts from 0 and the length of `k` minus 1), and `c` will be the next character in the reversed string `k`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is decreased by 1.
- `c` is the next character in the reversed string `k`.

Assuming that `k` has more than one character, let's denote the next character in the reversed string as `next_c`. If `k` had only one character, then `i` would reach 0 and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `i` is decreased by 1; `c` is the next character in the reversed string `k`**.
