Functionality: **The function converts a string `k`, which represents a number in a base-`n` numeral system, into its decimal (base-10) equivalent and prints the result. The function accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is less than `n` and `k` does not contain leading zeros. After executing the function, the program will have converted `k` from base `n` to decimal and printed the decimal value `x`. The function handles the case where `k` might have leading zeros by ignoring them during the conversion process. However, it does not handle the case where `k` might be empty; in such a scenario, the function would incorrectly treat `x` as 0.**

**Edge cases:**
- If `k` is an empty string, the function will incorrectly return 0.
- If `n` is outside the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the function will raise a `ValueError` when calling `int(input())` to assign `n`.
