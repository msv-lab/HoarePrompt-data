Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` in the reversed string `k` and corresponding index `i`; `i` is equal to the length of the string `k`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the reversed string `k` using `enumerate`.
   - The loop updates the variable `x` by adding `int(c) * n ** i` for each iteration, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - **Variable `x`**: Updated in each iteration.
   - **Variable `i`**: Starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of the string `k`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `x` will be the base-10 equivalent of the number represented by the string `k` in base `n`.
   - `i` will be equal to the length of the string `k` because the loop runs once for each character in `k`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final value of `x` is calculated as the sum of `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` in the reversed string `k` and corresponding index `i`.
   - This relationship is consistent with the behavior of converting a number from one base to another.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
