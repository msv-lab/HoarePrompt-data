The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k`, which is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits, where each digit is less than `n` and `k` does not contain leading zeros. The function returns a value based on the input `k` in base `n`.
