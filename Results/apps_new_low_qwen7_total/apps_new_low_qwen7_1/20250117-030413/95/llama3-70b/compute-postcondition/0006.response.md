`i` is decreased by 1, so `i -= 1`. The value of `c` is the next character in the reversed string `k`. The value of `x` is updated by adding `int(c) * n ** i` to its current value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `i` is decreased by 1 (so `i = i - 1`); `c` is the next character in the reversed string `k`; `x` is updated by adding `int(c) * n ** i` to its current value.
