The code `print(x)` simply prints the value of `x`. The value of `x` is calculated as the sum of `int(c) * n^i` for each digit `c` in the string `k`, where `i` is the position of the digit from right to left starting from 0. This does not change the values of the variables `n` or `k`, nor does it affect the value of `x` directly within this context since `x` is already computed before the print statement. Therefore, the output of the print statement is the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n^i` for each digit `c` in the string `k` and position `i` from right to left starting from 0; `x` is printed.**
