The code updates the value of `x` by adding the value of `int(c) * n ** i`. Here, `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`, and `i` is initially 0. 

- The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- The string `k` remains the same, with no more than 60 digits and containing only valid digits less than `n`.
- The variable `x` is updated to `x + int(c) * n ** i`, where `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`, and `i` is 0.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` is now 1).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system with no more than 60 digits and contains only valid digits less than `n`; `x` is `int(c) * n ** 0`, where `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`; `i` is 1.**
