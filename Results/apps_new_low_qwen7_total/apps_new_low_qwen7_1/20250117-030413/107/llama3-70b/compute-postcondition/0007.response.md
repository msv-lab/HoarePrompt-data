The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the constraints but are not passed as arguments to the function. The function returns a string based on certain conditions involving these parameters.

The conditions are:
- Case_1: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b. If no specific condition is given for the return value in this case, we consider it as a general case where the function might return a default value or handle the input in a generic way.
- Case_2: No additional conditions are explicitly provided beyond those already stated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a string based on the given constraints without accepting any parameters directly.

Functionality: **The function returns a string based on the given constraints involving `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` without accepting any parameters.**
