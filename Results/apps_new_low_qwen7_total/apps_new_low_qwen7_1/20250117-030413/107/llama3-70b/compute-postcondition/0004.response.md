`min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given the initial state where `b_floor` is 1 and `a_floor` is 2, the calculation is `(1 - 2) * 5 + 10 = -1 * 5 + 10 = -5 + 10 = 5`. Therefore, the value of `min_floor_time` is 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `m` is 2, `k` is 4, `a` is 7, `b` is 11, `a_floor` is 2, `a_block` is 1, `b_floor` is 1, `b_block` is 2, `min_block_time` is 15, `min_floor_time` is 5**
