The code `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` calculates the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` and prints it. The value of `min_floor_time` depends on the condition whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`. Given the initial values, `a_floor` is 2 and `b_floor` is 1, so `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, and thus `min_floor_time` is 15. The values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` do not change during the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the calculation is simply the sum of these two values.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `m` is 2, `k` is 4, `a` is 7, `b` is 11, `a_floor` is 2, `a_block` is 1, `b_floor` is 1, `b_block` is 2, `min_block_time` is 15, `min_floor_time` is 15, and the output of the print statement is 30.**
