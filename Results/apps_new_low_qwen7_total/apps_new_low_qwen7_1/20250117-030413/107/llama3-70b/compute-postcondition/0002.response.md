`min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given the initial state where `a_floor` is 2 and `b_floor` is 1, we can calculate the value of `min_floor_time` as follows:

\[
min_floor_time = (2 - 1) * 5 + 10 = 1 * 5 + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15
\]

The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is 3, `m` is 2, `k` is 4, `a` is 7, `b` is 11, `a_floor` is 2, `a_block` is 1, `b_floor` is 1, `b_block` is 2, `min_block_time` is 15, `min_floor_time` is 15**
