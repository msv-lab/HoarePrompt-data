Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the grid (n, m, k) and the starting positions of the two individuals (a, b).
2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the floor and block of each individual using the formulas:
   - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`
   - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
   - `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`
   - `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
3. **Minimum Block Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum time to move between blocks:
   - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`
   This accounts for the circular nature of the building.
4. **Minimum Floor Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum time to move between floors:
   - If `a_floor > b_floor`, it calculates `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`
   - Otherwise, it calculates `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`
5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time.

Given the detailed breakdown and the correctness of each step, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
