Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where the optimal path involves using the elevator within the same block to move between floors. Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate this:

### Example:
#### Input:
```
4 10 5
200 6
```
#### Expected Output:
```
39
```
#### Actual Output:
The program calculates the time based on moving to the first floor via the lift and then walking around the building, but it does not account for the possibility of using the elevator within the same block to minimize the time spent on stairs.

For the given input:
- Edward is in apartment 200, which is on the 10th floor of the 4th block.
- Natasha is in apartment 6, which is on the 1st floor of the 1st block.

The optimal path would involve:
1. Taking the elevator from the 10th floor of the 4th block to the 1st floor (10 seconds).
2. Walking to the 1st block (15 seconds).
3. Taking the elevator to the 2nd floor of the 1st block (1 second).

This results in a total time of \(10 + 15 + 1 = 26\) seconds, which is less than the calculated time of 39 seconds.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal path includes using the elevator within the same block. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
