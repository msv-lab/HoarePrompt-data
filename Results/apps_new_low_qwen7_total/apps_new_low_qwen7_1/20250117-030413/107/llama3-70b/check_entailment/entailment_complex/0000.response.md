Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum time required for two people to meet at the same location in a grid-based system. However, the logic in the program does not fully account for all possible scenarios, particularly those involving different combinations of floor and block movements and the optimal use of the lift.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Block Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum block time (`min_block_time`) is correct. It considers the shortest path around the building and accounts for the 15-second transition between blocks.

2. **Floor Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum floor time (`min_floor_time`) assumes that the only way to change floors is via the stairs, which may not always be the case. The lift can also be used to move between floors more quickly.

3. **Lift Usage**: The program does not consider using the lift to reduce the time spent moving between floors. Using the lift to go from one floor to another would take 10 seconds to wait and 1 second per floor to travel, making it faster than going up or down stairs.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal route involves using the lift. For example, if `a` and `b` are on different floors within the same block, using the lift could significantly reduce the time.

To address these issues, the program should be revised to include the lift usage in the floor time calculation. Here’s an improved version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1

    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1

    # Calculate the minimum block time
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15

    # Calculate the minimum floor time using the lift
    a_floor_idx = (a - 1) % (m * k)
    b_floor_idx = (b - 1) % (m * k)

    if a_floor_idx < b_floor_idx:
        min_floor_time = (b_floor_idx - a_floor_idx) // k + (10 + 1)  # Time to lift + travel time
    else:
        min_floor_time = ((m * k) - (a_floor_idx - b_floor_idx)) // k + (10 + 1)  # Time to lift + travel time

    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

With these changes, the program will correctly account for the use of the lift to minimize the time spent moving between floors. Therefore, the original program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the most efficient use of the lift.

Correctness: **False**
