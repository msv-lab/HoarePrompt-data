### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given Python function against the problem statement and the function summary. We'll verify each step of the logic and ensure that the function correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input.
   - This part of the function is correct.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks:**
   - The calculation for the floor (`a_floor` and `b_floor`) and block (`a_block` and `b_block`) is correct.
   - The formulas:
     \[
     a\_floor = (a - 1) \% m + 1
     \]
     \[
     a\_block = (a - 1) // (m \times k) + 1
     \]
     are used to determine the correct floor and block indices. This is accurate.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time Between Blocks:**
   - The formula to calculate the minimum time to travel between different blocks is correct.
   - The logic:
     \[
     \text{min\_block\_time} = \min(\text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block), n - \text{abs}(a\_block - b\_block)) \times 15
     \]
     accounts for the circular nature of the building and ensures the shortest path is taken. This is correct.

4. **Calculating Minimum Time Within the Same Block:**
   - The condition to determine whether to go up or down in the same block is correct.
   - The logic:
     \[
     \text{if } a\_floor > b\_floor: \\
     \quad \text{min\_floor\_time} = (a\_floor - b\_floor) \times 5 + 10 \\
     \text{else}: \\
     \quad \text{min\_floor\_time} = (b\_floor - a\_floor) \times 5 + 10
     \]
     correctly calculates the time required to move between floors. However, this logic assumes that the lift will always be available and that the time to use the lift is accounted for correctly. 

5. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - The final total time is correctly calculated by summing the time to move between blocks and the time to move within the same block.
   - The formula:
     \[
     \text{total\_time} = \text{min\_block\_time} + \text{min\_floor\_time}
     \]
     is correct.

#### Edge Cases:
- The function handles edge cases where `a` or `b` might be exactly on the boundary between blocks or floors correctly. For example, if `a` and `b` are on the same floor but different blocks, the time calculation works as intended.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The function follows the problem statement accurately.
- The logic for calculating the minimum time between blocks and within the same block is sound.
- The time calculations for moving using the lift and stairs are correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided Python function correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
