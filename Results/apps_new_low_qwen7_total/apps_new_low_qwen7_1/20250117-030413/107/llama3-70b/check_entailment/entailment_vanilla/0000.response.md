Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python function correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, we need to carefully analyze each part of the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the number of blocks `n`, floors `m`, and apartments per floor `k` from the first line of input.
   - It also correctly parses the apartment numbers `a` and `b` from the second line of input.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks:**
   - The calculation for the floor (`a_floor` and `b_floor`) and block (`a_block` and `b_block`) is correct. It uses modulo and integer division operations to determine the exact position of the apartment within its respective parameters.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time Between Blocks:**
   - The formula to calculate the minimum time to travel between different blocks is correct. It takes into account the minimum number of steps required to move between blocks, considering both directions and the circular nature of the building.

4. **Calculating Minimum Time Within the Same Block:**
   - The condition to determine whether to go up or down in the same block is correct. It adds 10 seconds for the lift and 5 seconds for each floor difference.

5. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - The final total time is correctly calculated by summing the time to move between blocks and the time to move within the same block.

Given that the function follows the outlined steps correctly and there are no apparent errors in the logic or calculations, the function should be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
