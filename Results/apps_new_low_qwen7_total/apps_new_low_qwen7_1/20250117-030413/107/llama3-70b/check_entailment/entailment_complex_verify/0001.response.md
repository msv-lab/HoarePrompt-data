### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python function correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, let's systematically evaluate each part of the logic and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the number of blocks `n`, floors `m`, and apartments per floor `k` from the first line of input using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It also correctly parses the apartment numbers `a` and `b` from the second line of input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks:**
   - The calculation for the floor (`a_floor` and `b_floor`) and block (`a_block` and `b_block`) is correct. It uses modulo and integer division operations to determine the exact position of the apartment within its respective parameters.
   - This ensures that the apartment number `a` and `b` are correctly mapped to their corresponding floor and block numbers.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time Between Blocks:**
   - The formula to calculate the minimum time to travel between different blocks is almost correct. However, there is a potential issue in the way the minimum block travel time is calculated.
   - The formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15` considers both direct paths around the circular building. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that traveling through other blocks might be faster.
   - For example, if `a_block` is 1 and `b_block` is `n`, the function will calculate the time as `min(1, n-1) * 15`, which may not always be the optimal path.

4. **Calculating Minimum Time Within the Same Block:**
   - The condition to determine whether to go up or down in the same block is correct. It adds 10 seconds for the lift and 5 seconds for each floor difference.
   - However, the function does not consider the possibility that the elevator might be called before reaching the desired floor, which could potentially save time.

5. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - The final total time is correctly calculated by summing the time to move between blocks and the time to move within the same block.
   - The formula used for the minimum block travel time and the minimum floor travel time are mostly correct but do not account for all possible optimizations.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle all possible optimizations and scenarios correctly. Specifically, it does not fully account for the most efficient path in terms of elevator usage and block traversal. There could be cases where the function might not find the absolute minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The function provided does not guarantee the correct minimum time in all scenarios due to the limitations in how it calculates the minimum block travel time and the lack of consideration for more optimal elevator usage.
