The function processes an input string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, asterisks (`*`), and question marks (`?`). It also takes an integer `k` as input. The function extracts up to `k` characters from `s` starting from the first character and following specific rules:
1. It includes only alphabetical characters in the result.
2. When encountering a `?`, it skips the next character.
3. When encountering a `*`, it repeats the previous character until another `*` is encountered, then skips the next character.
4. The function ensures the resulting list `ans` contains exactly `k` characters.
5. If the resulting list `ans` contains exactly `k` characters, it prints the joined version of `ans`. Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
