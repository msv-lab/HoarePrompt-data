The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The initial state specifies that `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than the length of `s`. After the increment by 2, the value of `i` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 2 and still less than `len(s)`, and `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.**
