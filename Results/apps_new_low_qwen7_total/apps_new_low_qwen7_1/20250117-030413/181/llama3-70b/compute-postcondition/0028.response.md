To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is the original list with an additional element `s[i]`.
- `i` is increased by 2.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
   
2. **Current Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is increased by 2 from the previous iteration.
   - We need to ensure both conditions in the loop header are met for the next iteration.

3. **First Condition: `i + 1 < len(s)`**
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than the length of `s`.

4. **Second Condition: `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
   - For the loop to continue, the character at index `i + 1` in `s` must be `'*'`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is increased by 2 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i + 1` (which is `i + 3` in the next iteration) must be within the bounds of `s` and the character at that index must be `'*'`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that:
- `i + 3 < len(s)`
- `s[i + 2] == '*'` (since in the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2`)

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure that `i + 3 < len(s)`.
- Ensure that `s[i + 2] == '*'`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` is the original list with an additional element `s[i]`, `i` is increased by 2, `i + 3 < len(s)`, and `s[i + 2] == '*'`**.
