The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` was less than the length of `s`, and now it will be one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is less than `len(s)` and is now `i + 1`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`, and `s[i]` is not a alphabetic character**
