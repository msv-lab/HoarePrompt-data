Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last `'*'` encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is `i + 2`.
- The loop condition is: `while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition Variables:**
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `i` and `s[i + 1]`.

2. **Check the Current State:**
   - `ans` contains characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last `'*'` encountered plus the character at index `i`.
   - `i` is set to `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'` must hold true.
   - From the given state, `i` is now `i + 2`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is increased by 2, the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - To satisfy the loop condition, `i + 1` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[i + 1]` must be `'*'`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

### Conclusion:
- We need to adjust the value of `i` so that `i + 1` is within the bounds of `s` and `s[i + 1]` is `'*'`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last `'*'` encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` must be such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
