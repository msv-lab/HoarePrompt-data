Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3.
   - `k` is greater than 0 (though `k` is not used in the loop condition, it remains unchanged).
   - `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the first character of `s` and the second element is `s[2]`.
   - `i` is 4.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the `and` statement must be true:
     - `i + 1 < len(s)`: This means `i + 1` must be less than the length of `s`.
     - `s[i + 1] == '*'`: This means the character at position `i + 1` in the string `s` must be «*».

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 4, so `i + 1` would be 5.
   - Therefore, the loop will check if `s[5] == '*'`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is fixed at 4, we need to ensure that `s[5]` is «*» for the loop to execute again.
   - The length of `s` must be at least 6 to allow `s[5]` to be checked, but since `s` has a length greater than 3, this is already satisfied.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `s[5]` must be «*».

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the first character of `s` and the second element is `s[2]`, and `s[5]` must be «*»**.
