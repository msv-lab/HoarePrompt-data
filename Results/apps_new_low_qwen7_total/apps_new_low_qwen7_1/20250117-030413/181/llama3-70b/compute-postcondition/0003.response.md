The code appends the current character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so the first character of `s` (which is a lowercase Latin letter) is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `s`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is an alphabet letter**
