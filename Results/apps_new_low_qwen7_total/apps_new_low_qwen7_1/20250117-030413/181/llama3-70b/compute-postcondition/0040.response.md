Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered. Depending on the value of `s[i]`:
- If `s[i]` is an alphabetic character, `i` is incremented by 1 or 2 (if `s[i+1]` is «?») and `len(ans)` remains less than `k`.
- If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, `i` is set to `i + 1`, and `len(ans)` is still less than `k`.***
