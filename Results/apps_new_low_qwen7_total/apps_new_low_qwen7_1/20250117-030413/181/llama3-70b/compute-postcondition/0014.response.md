Let's analyze the given code and the provided states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `ans` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `s`.
- `i` is 2.
- The current value of `s[i]` is «*».
- `i + 1` is either equal to the length of `s` or the character at `s[i + 1]` is not «?

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    ans.append(s[i])
    i += 2
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `ans`: This list grows by appending characters from `s` at position `i`.
   - `i`: This variable increases by 2 in each iteration.
   - `k`: This variable remains constant and is not involved in the loop.
   - `s`: This string is unchanged within the loop.

3. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, and appends `s[i]` to `ans`.
   - The loop will continue as long as the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'` hold true.
   - If the condition fails, the loop terminates.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `i + 1` reaches the end of the string (`len(s) - 1`), the loop will terminate even if `s[i + 1]` is «*» because `i + 1 < len(s)` will fail.
   - If `s[i + 1]` is not «*» at any point, the loop will also terminate.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will terminate when `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`.
   - After the loop, `ans` will contain a list of characters from `s` starting from index 2, up to the last «*» encountered before the loop condition fails.
   - `i` will be the next even index after the last «*» encountered, or `len(s)` if no more «*» are found.

### Given States Verification:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3.
  - `k` is greater than 0.
  - `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the first character of `s` and the second element is `s[2]`.
  - `i` is 4.
  - This matches the behavior since `ans` contains `s[0]` and `s[2]`, and `i` is incremented by 2.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3.
  - `k` is greater than 0.
  - `ans` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the first character of `s`, the second element is `s[2]`, and the third element is `s[4]`.
  - `i` is greater than 5, and `s[5]` is «*».
  - This matches the behavior since `ans` contains `s[0]`, `s[2]`, and `s[4]`, and `i` is incremented by 2.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `ans` is `["e"]`, and `i` is 2.
  - This implies that only the first character was added to `ans` and the loop did not find any more «*» after `s[2]`.
  - This could happen if `s[4]` is not «*» and the loop terminated early.

### Final Output State:
Based on the analysis, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations will be:

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, k is greater than 0, ans is a list containing characters from s starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, i is the next even index after the last «*» or len(s) if no more «*» are found, and s[i] is not «*.**
