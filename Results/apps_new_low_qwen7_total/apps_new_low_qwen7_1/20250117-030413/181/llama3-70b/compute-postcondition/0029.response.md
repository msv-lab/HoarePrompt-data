The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not form a complete logical block to execute and derive a final state. However, based on the given information and the context of the problem, I will infer the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given the constraints:
- `i + 3 < len(s)` must hold true.
- `s[i + 2] == '*'` must hold true.

Let's assume the initial state is as follows (since the exact initial state is not provided, I'll use placeholders):
- `s` is a string with a sufficient length and contains at least one `'*'` character at an appropriate position.
- `i` is an integer such that `i + 3 < len(s)` and `s[i + 2] == '*'`.

Based on these assumptions, let's set a hypothetical initial state:
- `s` is "********"
- `i` is 0 (which means `i + 2` is 2, and `s[2]` is `'*'`).

The code snippet:
```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

This code appends the character at index `i` to `ans` and then increments `i` by 2. Given our hypothetical initial state:
- `ans` is initially empty.
- `s` is "********".
- `i` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` will contain `s[0]`, which is `'*'`.
- `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 2.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `s` is still "********".
- `i` is now 2.
- `ans` is `['*']`.

Final Output State: **s is "********", i is 2, ans is ['*']**
