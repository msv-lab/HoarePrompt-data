The code `print(''.join(ans))` does not change the value of any variable. Instead, it prints the concatenation of the elements in the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` contains characters from the string `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered. After the print statement executes, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values), and the current length of `ans` is exactly equal to `k`. The list `ans` is printed.**
