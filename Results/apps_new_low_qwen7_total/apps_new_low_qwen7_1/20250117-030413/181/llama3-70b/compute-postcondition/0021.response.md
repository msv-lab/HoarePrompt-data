`i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `s[i]` is not an alphabet, after incrementing `i`, `s[i]` will also no longer be an alphabet because `i` has moved to the next position in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*,» and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is [], `i` is 1, `s[i]` is not an alphabet**
