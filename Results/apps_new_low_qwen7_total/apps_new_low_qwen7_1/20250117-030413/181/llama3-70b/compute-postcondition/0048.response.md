Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The loop condition is `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
2. We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time.
3. From the given state, `ans` is `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `i` is 6.
4. The first condition `i + 1 < len(s)` means `7 < len(s)`. This implies that `len(s)` must be greater than 7.
5. The second condition `s[i + 1] == '*'` means `s[7]` (since `i + 1` is 7) must be '*'.
6. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `len(s)` is greater than 7 and `s[7]` is '*'.

State: **`ans` is ['a', 'b', 'c'], `i` is 6, `len(s)` must be greater than 7 and `s[7]` must be '*'**
