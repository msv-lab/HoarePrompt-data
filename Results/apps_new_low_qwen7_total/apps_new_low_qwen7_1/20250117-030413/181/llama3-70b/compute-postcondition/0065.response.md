The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it expects the first line to be a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», with a maximum length of 200 characters. The second line is an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). Based on these inputs, the function will return something, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string and an integer \( k \) (not explicitly passed as parameters to the function), and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string and an integer \( k \) (not explicitly passed as parameters to the function), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
