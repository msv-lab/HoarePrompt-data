Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`. If `i + 1` is within bounds and `s[i + 1]` is «?», then `i` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `len(ans)` is equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, summarizing the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes.
