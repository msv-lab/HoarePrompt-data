Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables and the overall state.

**Initial State:**
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, where `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.
- `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`*`).
- `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

**Analysis:**
1. `ans.append(s[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`.
2. `i += 2`: This line increments the index `i` by 2.

Since `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1` and `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`*`), appending `s[i]` to `ans` and then incrementing `i` by 2 ensures that the next character to be considered is the one following the asterisk, which is valid according to the conditions.

After executing these two lines, the state of the variables will be:
- `ans` will contain one additional element, which is `s[i]`.
- `i` will be incremented by 2.

**Final Output State:**
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is the original list with an additional element `s[i]`.
- `i` is increased by 2.

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, k is greater than 0, ans is a list containing characters from s starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index i with an additional element s[i], i is i + 2**
