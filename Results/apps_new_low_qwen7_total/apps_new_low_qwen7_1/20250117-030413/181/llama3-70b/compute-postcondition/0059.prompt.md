Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, ans is [], i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
    if s[i].isalpha():
        ans.append(s[i])
        if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
            i += 2
        elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
            while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                ans.append(s[i])
                i += 2
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values), and `s[i]` is not «*» or an alphabet letter if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered. Depending on the value of `s[i]`:
- If `s[i]` is an alphabetic character, `i` is incremented by 1 or 2 (if `s[i+1]` is «?») and `len(ans)` remains less than `k`.
- If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, `i` is set to `i + 1`, and `len(ans)` is still less than `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, and `i` is increased by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the next character is «?». The condition `i < \text{len}(s)` and `len(ans) < k` still holds.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
