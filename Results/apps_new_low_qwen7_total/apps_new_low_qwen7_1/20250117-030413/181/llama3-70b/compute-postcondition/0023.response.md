To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

The loop condition is:
```
while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
```

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:
1. `i < len(s)`
2. `len(ans) < k`

Given states:
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered.
- `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values).
- `s[i]` is not «*» or an alphabet letter if the else part is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `i < len(s)`**:
   - The current value of `i` determines this part of the condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `s`.

2. **Condition `len(ans) < k`**:
   - The current length of `ans` determines this part of the condition.
   - For the loop to continue, the length of `ans` must be less than `k`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- To ensure `i < len(s)`, we need to adjust `i` such that it is still within the bounds of `s`.
- To ensure `len(ans) < k`, we need to adjust `ans` such that its length is still less than `k`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we assume the loop increments `i` and potentially modifies `ans` based on the characters in `s`.

### Final Answer:

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be set to a value that is still less than `len(s)`.
- `ans` should be a list that still has fewer elements than `k`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` must be less than `len(s)`, and `len(ans)` must be less than `k`.**
