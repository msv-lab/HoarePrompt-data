The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 6, we need to determine the value of `s[6]`. However, since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can't directly determine `s[6]`. But we know that `len(s) > 7` and `s[7] == '*'`, which implies `s[6]` exists and is part of the string.

The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2, so `i` becomes 8.

Since `s[7] == '*'` is a condition and must be true, it's safe to assume `s[6]` is a valid character, though its exact value is not specified. After the operations, the updated values are:
- `i` is now 8
- `ans` has the original elements `['a', 'b', 'c']` and additionally contains the character at index 6 of `s`.

The final output state considering the above analysis would be:
Output State: **ans is ['a', 'b', 'c', s[6]], i is 8**
