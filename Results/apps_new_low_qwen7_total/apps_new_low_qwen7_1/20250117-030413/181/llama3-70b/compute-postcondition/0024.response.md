`ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered. The value of `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `len(ans)` is less than `k`. The code appends the character at index `i` of `s` to `ans`.

After executing the code `ans.append(s[i])`, the length of `ans` increases by 1, and it now contains one more character from `s` at index `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and still less than `len(s)`, and `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.**
