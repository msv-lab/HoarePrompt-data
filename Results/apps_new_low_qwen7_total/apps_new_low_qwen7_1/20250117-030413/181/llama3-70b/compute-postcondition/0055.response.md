Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at the previous index of `i` (or `i` if the next character is not «?»), and `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the next character is «?». The condition `i < \text{len}(s)` and `len(ans) < k` still holds.***
