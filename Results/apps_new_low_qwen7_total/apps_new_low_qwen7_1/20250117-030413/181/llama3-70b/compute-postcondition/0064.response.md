Postcondition: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values). If the length of `ans` is exactly equal to `k`, the list `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the length of `ans` is less than `k`.**
