Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1 and still less than `len(s)`, and `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`. If the next character (`s[i + 1]`) is an asterisk, `ans` contains characters from `s` at even indices until the next asterisk is found; otherwise, `ans` is updated as per the original rule.***
