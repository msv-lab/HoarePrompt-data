Initial State: `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last `'*'` encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` must be such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`

Code Block:
```
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

Analysis:
- The first line appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the list `ans`.
- The second line increments `i` by 2.

Given the precondition, let's assume an example to illustrate the process. Suppose `s` is "abc*def*g*" and `i` is 2 (so `s[i]` is 'c' and `s[i+1]` is '*').

1. After the first line, `ans` will be `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `i` will become 4.
2. After the second line, `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will become 6.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will be:

Output State: **ans is ['a', 'b', 'c'], i is 6**
