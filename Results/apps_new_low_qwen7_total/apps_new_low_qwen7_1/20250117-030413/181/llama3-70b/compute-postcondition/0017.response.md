The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, after executing this line, `i` will be 2. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `ans`, and the current value of `s[i + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `s`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is either not «*» or `i + 1` is equal to the length of `s`.**
