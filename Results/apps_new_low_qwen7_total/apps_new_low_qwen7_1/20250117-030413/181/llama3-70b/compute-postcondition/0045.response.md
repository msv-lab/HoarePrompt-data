Given the initial state where `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, and `i + 1` must be within bounds and `s[i + 1]` must be «*», we need to execute the following Python code:

```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

Let's break down the code and determine the impact on the variables:

1. `ans.append(s[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`.
2. `i += 2`: This line increments the index `i` by 2.

Since the precondition ensures that `i + 1` is within bounds and `s[i + 1]` is «*», this code will execute without raising an error.

To find the final state, let's consider a hypothetical example based on the conditions given:

### Hypothetical Example:
- Initial State: `s = "abc*d"`, `i = 3` (because the last «*» is at index 3), `ans = ['a', 'b']`
- Execution of the code:
  - `ans.append(s[i])` -> `ans` becomes `['a', 'b', 'd']` because `s[3]` is 'd'.
  - `i += 2` -> `i` becomes `5`.

### General Case:
- After executing the code, `ans` will have one additional character from `s` at index `i` appended to it, and `i` will be incremented by 2.

### Final Output State:
Given the general nature of the problem, the exact values of `ans` and `i` depend on the specific values of `s` and `i`. However, the structure of the final state will follow the pattern described.

Output State: **ans is a list containing characters from s starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index i, i is i + 2**
