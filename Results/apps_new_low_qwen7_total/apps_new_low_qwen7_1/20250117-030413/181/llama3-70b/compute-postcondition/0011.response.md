Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3, k is greater than 0, ans is a list containing three elements where the first element is the first character of s, the second element is s[2], and the third element is s[i], i is greater than 5, s[5] is «*»**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s` and `s[2]`.
- The loop starts with `ans.append(s[i])` and then increments `i` by 2.
- For the given conditions, `i` must be less than the length of `s` and `i` should be greater than 2 (since we are appending `s[2]` initially).
- However, since `i` is incremented by 2 each time and `s[5]` must be «*», the only valid `i` that fits these criteria is `i = 5`, which makes `s[i]` equal to «*».
- After appending «*» to `ans`, `i` is incremented to 7, which is out of the bounds of the string `s` assuming the length of `s` is greater than 7 (since `s[5]` is «*» and it's the last valid index based on the given constraints).

Therefore, the final state includes `ans` now having three elements: the first character of `s`, `s[2]`, and `s[5]` (which is «*»).
