To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < \text{len}(s) \text{ and } \text{len}(ans) < k \]

This means the loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. \( i < \text{len}(s) \)
2. \( \text{len}(ans) < k \)

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, either:
1. \( i \) should be incremented such that \( i < \text{len}(s) \).
2. \( \text{len}(ans) \) should be incremented but remain less than \( k \).

#### Analyzing Each Condition
1. **Condition \( i < \text{len}(s) \):**
   - To satisfy this condition, \( i \) needs to be incremented.
   - The current value of \( i \) is such that it would be incremented to meet this condition.

2. **Condition \( \text{len}(ans) < k \):**
   - To satisfy this condition, \( \text{len}(ans) \) should be incremented without reaching \( k \).
   - This can happen if the next character added to `ans` keeps `len(ans)` less than `k`.

### Conclusion
Since the loop will continue as long as both conditions hold, we need to ensure that either \( i \) is incremented to stay within bounds or \( \text{len}(ans) \) remains less than \( k \). However, since the loop will continue based on the current values of \( i \) and \( \text{len}(ans) \), the key adjustment needed is ensuring that the next character added to `ans` does not cause \( \text{len}(ans) \) to reach or exceed \( k \).

### Final State Adjustment
- We need to ensure that \( \text{len}(ans) < k \) and \( i \) is incremented to stay within bounds.

Thus, the state adjustments are:
- Ensure \( \text{len}(ans) < k \).
- Increment \( i \) to stay within bounds.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, and \( i \) is such that \( i < \text{len}(s) \) and \( \text{len}(ans) < k \)**.
