Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head conditions:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
   ```

2. **Determine which states need adjustment:**
   - The first condition is `i + 1 < len(s)`.
   - The second condition is `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

3. **Analyze the current state:**
   - We know that `s` is the string.
   - We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - For the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` to hold true for the next iteration, `i` should be such that `i + 1` is still within the bounds of the string `s`. This means `i` should be less than `len(s) - 1`.
   - For the condition `s[i + 1] == '*'` to hold true for the next iteration, the character at position `i + 1` in the string `s` must be an asterisk (`*`).

Given that these are the only conditions that determine whether the loop can continue, we need to ensure that both of these conditions are satisfied for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.
- `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`*`).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`s` is such that `i` is less than `len(s) - 1` and `s[i + 1]` is an asterisk (`*`)**
(Note: The exact value of `s` is not provided, but the constraints on `i` and the character at `i + 1` need to be satisfied.)
