Given the initial state where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» (with a length not exceeding 200), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 200\), the provided code snippet reads two lines of input and initializes a list `ans` and an index `i` to 0. However, no further operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the final output state will retain the values of `s` and `k` as they were initially read from the input, while `ans` remains an empty list, and `i` remains 0. 

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, ans is [], i is 0**
