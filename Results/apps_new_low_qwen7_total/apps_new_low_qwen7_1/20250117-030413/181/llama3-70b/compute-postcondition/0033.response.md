`i` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `i` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` contains characters from `s` at even indices until the next asterisk is found, and `i` is the index right after the last asterisk that caused the loop to append a character to `ans`, or it could be the end of the string if no more asterisks are found; `i` is increased by 1.**
