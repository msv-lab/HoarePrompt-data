`i` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `i` is now one more than its previous value. The state of `ans` and the value of `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` up to the last «*» encountered, plus any additional characters specified by the number of iterations; `i` is the index just beyond the last «*» encountered or the end of `s`, and `i` is increased by 1.
