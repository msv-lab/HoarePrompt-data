The code `print('Impossible')` simply prints the string 'Impossible' and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values), and `len(ans)` is less than `k`.**
