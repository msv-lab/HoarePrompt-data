The code `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Given the initial state where `i < \text{len}(s)` and `len(ans) < k`, the value of `i` is updated but no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is increased by 2, and the condition `i < \text{len}(s)` and `len(ans) < k` still holds.**
