Postcondition: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, and \( i \) is such that \( i < \text{len}(s) \) and \( \text{len}(ans) < k \), and \( i + 1 \geq \text{len}(s) \) or \( s[i + 1] \neq '*' \)
