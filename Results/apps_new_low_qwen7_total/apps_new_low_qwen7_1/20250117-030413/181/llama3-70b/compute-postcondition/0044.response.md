To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop and the current state of the variables right before the loop.

The condition inside the `while` loop is:
```python
i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The first part of the condition, `i + 1 < len(s)`, checks if the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - The second part of the condition, `s[i + 1] == '*'`, checks if the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`'*'`).

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`.
   - `i` is such that `i < len(s)` and `len(ans) < k`.

### Ensuring the Loop Executes the First Time:

For the loop to execute at least once, both parts of the condition must be true when the loop starts:
- `i + 1 < len(s)` must be true.
- `s[i + 1] == '*'` must be true.

Given the constraints:
- Since `i < len(s)`, `i + 1` is guaranteed to be within bounds as long as `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.
- The key requirement is ensuring that `s[i + 1] == '*'` is true. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute the first time, `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`'*'`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, and `i + 1` must be within bounds and `s[i + 1]` must be «*»**
