To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i + 1 < len(s)`**
   - This condition checks if the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - Before the loop, `i` is 2. Therefore, `i + 1` is 3.
   - For `i + 1 < len(s)` to be true, the length of `s` must be greater than 3.

2. **Condition 2: `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at the index `i + 1` is a `'*'`.
   - Before the loop, the value of `s[i + 1]` (which is `s[3]`) is given as `'*'`.

### Combining the Conditions:

- For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be satisfied.
- The second condition is already met because `s[i + 1]` is `'*'`.
- The first condition requires that `len(s) > 3`.

### Current State:
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `ans` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `s`.
- `i` is 2.
- The current value of `s[i]` (which is `s[2]`) is unspecified but doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
- The character at `s[i + 1]` (which is `s[3]`) is `'*'`.
- The length of `s` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `s`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is unspecified but does not affect the loop's execution.**
