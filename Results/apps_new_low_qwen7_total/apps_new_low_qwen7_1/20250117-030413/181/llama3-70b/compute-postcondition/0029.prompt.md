You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: - Since `i` is increased by 2 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i + 1` (which is `i + 3` in the next iteration) must be within the bounds of `s` and the character at that index must be `'*'`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that:
- `i + 3 < len(s)`
- `s[i + 2] == '*'` (since in the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2`)

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure that `i + 3 < len(s)`.
- Ensure that `s[i + 2] == '*'`.

### Final Answer:
State:
```
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
