The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the next even index after the last «*» or `len(s)` if no more «*» are found, and `s[i]` is not «*», the value of `i` is updated to the next index. 

Therefore, the updated value of `i` is one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next even index after the last «*» or `len(s)` if no more «*» are found, and `s[i]` is not «*»; `i` is incremented by 1.**
