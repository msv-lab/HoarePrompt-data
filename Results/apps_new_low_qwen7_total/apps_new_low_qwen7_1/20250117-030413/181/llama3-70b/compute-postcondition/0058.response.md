Postcondition: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, and `i` is increased by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the next character is «?». The condition `i < \text{len}(s)` and `len(ans) < k` still holds.**
