The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. According to the initial state, `i` is such that `len(ans) < k` and `i + 1 >= len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be one more than its previous value. The conditions for `ans` and `k` remain unchanged, and the value of `s` remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index (i-1), and `i` is incremented by 1.**
