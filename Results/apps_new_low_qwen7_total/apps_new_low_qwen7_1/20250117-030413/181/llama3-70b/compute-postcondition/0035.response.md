The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was previously incremented by 1 but was not equal to the length of `s`. Since `i` is incremented again, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1, but it is still not equal to the length of `s`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1 and still not equal to `len(s)`, and `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`**
