Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop condition is `i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `s[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3.
   - `k` is greater than 0 (though `k` is not part of the loop condition, it doesn't affect the loop continuation).
   - `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is the first character of `s`, the second element is `s[2]`, and the third element is `s[i]`, where `i` is greater than 5.
   - `s[5]` is «*».

3. **Loop condition analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     - `i + 1 < len(s)`
     - `s[i + 1] == '*'`

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `s[5]` is «*», the current value of `i` must be such that `s[i + 1]` is «*». This means `i` must be 5 (since `i + 1` should be 6, and `s[6-1] = s[5]` is «*»).
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 6 (making `i + 1` equal to 7, which is within the bounds of `s` since `len(s)` is greater than 3).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 6.

**Final State:**
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length greater than 3, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the first character of `s`, the second element is `s[2]`, and the third element is `s[6]`, `i` must be 6**
