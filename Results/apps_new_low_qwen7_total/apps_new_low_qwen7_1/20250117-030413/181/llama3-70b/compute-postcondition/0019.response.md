Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next even index after the last «*» or `len(s)` if no more «*» are found, and `s[i]` is not «*». If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `s` or `s[i + 1]` is not «?», then `i` is the next even index after the last «*» or `len(s)`. If `i + 1` is the position of a «?», then `ans` is updated to include the character at `s[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s[i]` is not «*». If `i` reaches 4 and `s[i-1]` is an alphabet letter, `i` is set to 4 and `s[i]` is not «*»; otherwise, `i` is 2.***
