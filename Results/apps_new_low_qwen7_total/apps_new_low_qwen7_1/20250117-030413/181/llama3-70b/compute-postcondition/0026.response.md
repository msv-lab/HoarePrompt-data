To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the requirements and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and still less than `len(s)`.
   - `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   ```python
   while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the condition must be true:
- `i + 1 < len(s)` must be true.
- `s[i + 1] == '*'` must be true.

Let's analyze each part:

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `i + 1 < len(s)`**:
   - This condition checks if the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after adding the current character to `ans`, `i` should be less than `len(s) - 1` initially to satisfy this condition when `i` is incremented.

2. **Condition `s[i + 1] == '*'`**:
   - This condition checks if the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` is an asterisk (`*`).

### Required Adjustments:
- To satisfy `i + 1 < len(s)`, `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1` initially.
- To satisfy `s[i + 1] == '*'`, the character at index `i + 1` must be an asterisk.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the loop condition, the only variables controlling the loop execution are `i` and `s`. The required adjustment is to ensure that `i + 1` is within bounds and the next character is an asterisk.

Thus, the state right before the loop must be such that:
- `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.
- `s[i + 1]` is an asterisk (`*`).

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1`, and `s[i + 1]` must be an asterisk (`*`), and `len(ans)` is now equal to `len(ans) + 1` and still less than `k`.**
