Based on the provided code snippet, we can see that it is incomplete as neither `ans` nor `s` nor `i` are defined before these lines. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the following initial state:
- `ans` is an empty list `[]`
- `s` is a string, for example, `s = "example"`
- `i` is an integer, for example, `i = 0`

Let's proceed with these assumptions to determine the final output state.

1. `ans.append(s[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`.
   - If `i = 0` and `s = "example"`, then `ans` becomes `["e"]`.

2. `i += 2`: This line increments the value of `i` by 2.
   - If `i = 0` initially, after this line, `i` becomes `2`.

Since the code snippet does not continue further, the final state of the program would be:
Output State: **ans is ["e"], i is 2**
