`ans` is appended with the character at index `i` in `s`. Since `i` is less than the length of `s` and the length of `ans` is less than `k`, the value of `ans` will be updated to include the character at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered plus the character at index `i`, and \( i \) is such that \( i < \text{len}(s) \) and \( \text{len}(ans) < k \)**
