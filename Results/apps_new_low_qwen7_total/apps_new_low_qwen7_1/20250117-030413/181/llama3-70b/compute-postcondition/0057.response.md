The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `ans`, and the original value of `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, and `i` is increased by 1.**
