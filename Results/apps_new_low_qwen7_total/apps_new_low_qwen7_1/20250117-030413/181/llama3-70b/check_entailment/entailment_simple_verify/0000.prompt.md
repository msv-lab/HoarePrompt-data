You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.


-----Examples-----

If the length of `ans` is exactly equal to `k`, the list `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the length of `ans` is less than `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the string contains multiple consecutive snowflakes (`*`) after a letter, which allows for multiple repetitions of that letter. Specifically, the program only accounts for a single repetition when it encounters a snowflake, but it should allow for any number of repetitions.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
a*b*c*
3
```

The correct output should be a string like `aaabc`, `aabbc`, etc., but the current implementation will only generate strings like `abc` or `aac`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles multiple repetitions allowed by consecutive snowflakes. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    k = int(input())
    ans = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
        if s[i].isalpha():
            # Append the letter
            ans.append(s[i])
            # Check for snowflakes and handle multiple repetitions
            while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                ans[-1] = ans[-1] * (len(ans) > 1 or ans[-2] != s[i])  # Ensure not repeating the last character if it's different
                i += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == k:
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        print('Impossible')
```

This version correctly handles the case where a letter can be repeated multiple times due to consecutive snowflakes.
