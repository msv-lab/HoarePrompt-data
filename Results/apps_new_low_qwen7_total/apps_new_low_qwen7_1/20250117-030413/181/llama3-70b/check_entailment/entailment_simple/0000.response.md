Reasoning:

The given program attempts to decode the message based on the rules specified for snowflakes (`*`) and candy canes (`?`). Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the string and the integer \( k \).
2. **Building the Message:** The program iterates through the string:
   - When it encounters a letter, it appends the letter to `ans`.
   - When it encounters a `?`, it skips the next character.
   - When it encounters a `*`, it can append the current letter multiple times until the next `*` or the end of the string.
3. **Checking Length:** After the loop, it checks if the length of `ans` matches \( k \). If it does, it prints the decoded message; otherwise, it prints `Impossible`.

Let's verify each part of the logic:

- **Input Reading:** Correctly handles reading the string and integer \( k \).
- **Building the Message:**
  - Handling of `?`: Skips the next character, which is correct.
  - Handling of `*`: Appends the current letter multiple times until the next `*` or the end of the string. This is consistent with the rules provided.
- **Length Check:** Checks if the final length of `ans` matches \( k \) and prints accordingly. This is also correct.

Given that the provided program follows the rules accurately and correctly implements the logic for decoding the message, it appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
