Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to extract characters from the input string `s` based on the specified rules for `*` (snowflake) and `?` (candy cane).
- The program iterates through the string `s` and constructs a list `ans` containing up to `k` characters.
- It handles each character in `s` appropriately:
  - Alphabetical characters are added directly to `ans`.
  - A `?` causes the program to skip the next character.
  - A `*` causes the previous character to be appended multiple times until another `*` is encountered, then the next character is skipped.
- After processing the string, the program checks if the length of `ans` is exactly `k`. If so, it prints the joined version of `ans`. If not, it prints "Impossible".
- Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the decryption logic and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
