Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first line is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?». The string length does not exceed 200. The second line is an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \).
def func():
    s = input()

k = int(input())

ans = []

i = 0
    while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
        if s[i].isalpha():
            ans.append(s[i])
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
                i += 2
            elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                    ans.append(s[i])
                    i += 2
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values), and `len(ans)` is exactly equal to `k`.
    if (len(ans) == k) :
        print(''.join(ans))
    else :
        print('Impossible')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?» with a length not exceeding 200, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` starting from the first character up to the last «*» encountered, `i` is the next appropriate index based on the conditions described (next even index after the last «*», or the end of the string if no «*» is found, or adjusted as per the special cases involving «?» and 'i' values). If the length of `ans` is exactly equal to `k`, the list `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the length of `ans` is less than `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, asterisks (`*`), and question marks (`?`). It also takes an integer `k` as input. The function extracts up to `k` characters from `s` starting from the first character and following specific rules:
1. It includes only alphabetical characters in the result.
2. When encountering a `?`, it skips the next character.
3. When encountering a `*`, it repeats the previous character until another `*` is encountered, then skips the next character.
4. The function ensures the resulting list `ans` contains exactly `k` characters.
5. If the resulting list `ans` contains exactly `k` characters, it prints the joined version of `ans`. Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
