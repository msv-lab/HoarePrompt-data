Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes by reading the input string `s` and the integer `k`.
2. The core logic of the program iterates through the string `s` and builds the list `ans` according to the specified rules for `?` and `*`.
   - It handles `?` by skipping the next character.
   - It handles `*` by repeating the previous character multiple times until encountering another `*` or reaching the end of the string.
3. After the loop, the program checks if the length of `ans` is exactly `k`.
4. If the length of `ans` is exactly `k`, it prints the joined version of `ans`.
5. If the length of `ans` is less than `k`, it prints "Impossible".

Given these points, the logic appears to accurately follow the problem description and should work for all valid inputs as described. Therefore, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
