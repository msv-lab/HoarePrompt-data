The function processes a ruler with `n` marks at positions specified in the list `marks`. It checks if two distances `x` and `y` can be measured using these marks. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0`. If not, it tries to find a way to measure at least one of the distances using the available marks. If both distances cannot be measured, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances. If only one distance can be measured, it prints the other distance.
