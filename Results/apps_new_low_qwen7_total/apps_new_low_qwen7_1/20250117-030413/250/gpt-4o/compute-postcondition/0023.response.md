The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we are inside. The values of the variables `marks`, `mark`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify any variable values.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[2]`, `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
