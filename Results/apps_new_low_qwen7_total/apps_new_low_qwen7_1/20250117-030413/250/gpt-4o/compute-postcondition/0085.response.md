The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l).

The function does not have a return value specified in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.**
