Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is equal to `marks[0]`.
- `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.
- `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.
- If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list, assigning the current element to the variable `mark`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `marks` is not empty.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `mark` is set to the first element of the list (`marks[0]`), and `x_found` and `y_found` are determined based on the current value of `mark`.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration
- Since the loop iterates over the elements of the `marks` list, the next value of `mark` will be the next element in the list.
- The values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless the loop breaks due to the condition specified (both `x_found` and `y_found` being `True`).

Given that the loop does not change the values of `x_found` and `y_found` unless the internal conditions are met, and the only change is in the value of `mark`, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

### Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration
- `marks` remains a non-empty list (unless it becomes empty due to the internal loop breaking condition, but since no such condition is given here, it remains non-empty).
- `mark` is now the second element of the list (`marks[1]`).
- `x_found` and `y_found` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.**
