Postcondition: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[0]`, and the variable `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. If neither condition is met, `x_found` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `(mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set)`, then `y` is a valid value such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set` and `x_found` remains unchanged.**
