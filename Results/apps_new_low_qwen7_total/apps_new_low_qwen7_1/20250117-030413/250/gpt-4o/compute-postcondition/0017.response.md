Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
