In the given code snippet, `new_marks.add(mark + x)` is attempted, but there is a misunderstanding because `new_marks` is defined as a list, not a set. Assuming this was meant to be a list operation (i.e., appending), let's proceed with that assumption.

The initial state includes:
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is the first element of `marks`.
- `marks_set` is any set.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is an empty list.

The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + x)` attempts to append `mark + x` to `new_marks`. However, since `new_marks` is a list, the correct method to use would be `new_marks.append(mark + x)`.

Given the misunderstanding, assuming the correct operation is `append` and not `add`, the value of `mark + x` will be appended to `new_marks`.

The output state will be:
- `new_marks` is a list that now contains the element `mark + x`.
- All other variables (`marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_marks` is a list containing `mark + x`, `marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`.**
