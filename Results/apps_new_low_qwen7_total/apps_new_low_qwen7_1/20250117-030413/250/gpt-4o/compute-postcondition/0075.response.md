The code initializes an empty list named `result`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. 

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are `True` if their respective conditions were met, `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations, `result` is an empty list**
