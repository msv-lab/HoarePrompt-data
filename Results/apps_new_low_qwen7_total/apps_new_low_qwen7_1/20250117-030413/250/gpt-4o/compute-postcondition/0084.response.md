Postcondition: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks` after possibly being popped from the list, `x_found` and `y_found` retain their original boolean values, and the final state of `x_found` and `y_found` indicates whether `x` and `y` were found in relation to any mark in the `marks` list based on the given conditions. The console prints either 0 (if both `x_found` and `y_found` are True) or the value of the popped element (if the loop is exited without both `x_found` and `y_found` being True).**
