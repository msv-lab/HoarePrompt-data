Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean flags indicating whether their respective conditions were met, `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations, and `result` is a list. If `x_found` is False, `result` contains `x`; otherwise, `result` remains unchanged.***
