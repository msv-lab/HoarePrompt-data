The code appends `y` to the list `result`. Initially, `y_found` is `False`, and `result` contains `x` if `x_found` is `False`, otherwise `result` remains unchanged. After appending `y` to `result`, `y` will be added to the list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean flags indicating whether their respective conditions were met, `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations, and `result` is a list where if `x_found` is `False`, `result` now contains `x` and `y`, otherwise `result` contains only `y`. `y_found` is `True`.**
