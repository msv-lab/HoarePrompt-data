The code snippet adds `mark + y` to `new_marks`. Given that `new_marks` is a list, this operation appends `mark + y` to `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was initially empty, after this line of code, it will have one element which is `mark + y`.

The variables `marks`, `mark`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `x` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a list with the second element being `mark + y`, and the first element being `mark + y`.**
