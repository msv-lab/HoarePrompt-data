Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y_found` remains `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.***
