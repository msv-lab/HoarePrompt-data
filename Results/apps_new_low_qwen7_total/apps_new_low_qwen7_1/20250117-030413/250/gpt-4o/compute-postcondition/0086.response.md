Functionality: **The function processes a ruler with `n` marks at positions specified in the list `marks`. It checks if two distances `x` and `y` can be measured using these marks. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0`. If not, it tries to find a way to measure at least one of the distances using the available marks. If both distances cannot be measured, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances. If only one distance can be measured, it prints the other distance.**

**Edge Cases:**
1. If both `x` and `y` can be directly measured from any mark (`mark + x` or `mark - x` in `marks_set` and `mark + y` or `mark - y` in `marks_set`), the function prints `0`.
2. If neither `x` nor `y` can be directly measured from any mark, the function calculates the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances. If no additional marks are needed to measure at least one distance, it prints `1`.
3. If only one distance can be measured, the function prints the other distance.

**Missing Functionality:**
1. The function does not handle the case where the input values `x` and `y` are zero. In such cases, the function should return an appropriate message or handle the scenario differently since measuring distances with zero is meaningless.
2. The function does not check if the marks list is sorted. While the code assumes the list is sorted, an unsorted list could lead to incorrect results. A validation check for sorted order would be beneficial.
