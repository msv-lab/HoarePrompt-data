Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is the last element of `marks`.
- `marks_set` is any set.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is a list.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each `mark` in `marks`.

### Loop Body:
For each `mark` in `marks`, the loop checks the following conditions:
1. If `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, `mark - y - x`, or `mark + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`.
2. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.

In all other cases, `new_marks` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `mark` and `marks`.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - `mark` is being updated as it moves through each element in `marks`.
   - `marks` remains the same during the loop (it doesn't change within the loop body).
   - `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` are not directly modified by the loop head but might be modified inside the loop body.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `mark` will be the next element in `marks`.
   - `marks` remains the same.
   - `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` might change inside the loop body but are not part of the loop head adjustments.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are only the ones related to the loop head, specifically `mark` and `marks`.

### Updated State:
- `mark` will be the next element in `marks`.
- `marks` remains the same.

Since `marks` is a non-empty list and `mark` is the last element of `marks`, the next element `mark` will be the first element of `marks`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list.**
