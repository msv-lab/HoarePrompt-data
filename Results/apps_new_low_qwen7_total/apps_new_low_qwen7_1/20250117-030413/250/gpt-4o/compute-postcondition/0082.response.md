The provided code consists of two print statements. Let's analyze their effects:

1. `print(len(result))`: This line prints the length of the `result` list. Based on the initial state, if `y_found` is `True`, then `result` contains `y`; otherwise, it contains both `x` and `y`. However, the length of `result` does not change this content. The length will be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `y_found`.

2. `print(' '.join(map(str, result)))`: This line prints the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces, converted to strings using `map(str, result)`. Again, this does not change the contents of `result` but merely prints them.

Since the code does not modify any variables and only prints the existing values, the variables remain unchanged. The output of the first print statement gives us the length of `result`, and the second print statement provides the elements of `result` as a space-separated string.

Given the initial state:
- `marks` is a non-empty list,
- `mark` is the last element of `marks`,
- `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean flags indicating whether their respective conditions were met,
- `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations (though not used in the given code),
- `result` is a list that contains either `x` and `y` (if `y_found` is `False`) or just `y` (if `y_found` is `True`).

The final output state is determined by the values of `x_found` and `y_found`:

If `y_found` is `True`, `result` contains `y` and the output will be:
```
1
y
```

If `y_found` is `False`, `result` contains both `x` and `y` and the output will be:
```
2
x y
```

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **result contains either 'x' and 'y' if y_found is False, or only 'y' if y_found is True; the length of result is 1 if y_found is True, otherwise 2; x_found and y_found retain their original boolean values; marks, mark, new_marks retain their original values**
