The code `y_found = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. This assignment does not affect the values of `marks`, `mark`, `x_found`, or the `marks_set`. The only change is that `y_found` is now set to `True`.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[0]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
