Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list. If `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks`'s second element is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `new_marks`'s second element is `mark - x`.***
