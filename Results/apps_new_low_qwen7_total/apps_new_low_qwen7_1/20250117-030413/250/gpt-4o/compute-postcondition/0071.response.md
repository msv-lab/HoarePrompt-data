Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step and derive the final output state after all executions of the loop.

### Initial State
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is equal to `marks[-1]`.
- `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.
- `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.
- Both `x_found` and `y_found` are not simultaneously `True`.
- `new_marks` is an empty set.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each `mark` in `marks` and updates `new_marks` based on certain conditions involving `x` and `y`.

#### First Iteration
- The loop starts with `mark` being the last element of `marks`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` are initially checked.
- Depending on whether `x_found` or `y_found` is `False`, the corresponding conditions are evaluated and `new_marks` is updated.

#### Subsequent Iterations
- Each iteration modifies `mark` to the next element in `marks`.
- The same conditions are evaluated for `x_found` and `y_found` and `new_marks` is updated accordingly.

### Observations
- `x_found` and `y_found` are only updated if the corresponding condition is met within the loop.
- `new_marks` accumulates elements based on the conditions provided.
- `mark` changes with each iteration to the next element in `marks`.

### Final State After All Iterations
- The loop will continue until all elements in `marks` are processed.
- By the end of the loop, `mark` will be the last element of `marks`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` will be `True` if the respective conditions were met for any `mark` in `marks`.
- `new_marks` will contain all the elements added during the iterations based on the conditions provided.

### Summary
- `marks` remains as a non-empty list, but `mark` becomes the last element of `marks` after all iterations.
- `x_found` and `y_found` become `True` if the respective conditions were met for any `mark` in `marks`.
- `new_marks` is a set containing all the elements added during the loop iterations.

### Output State
Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are `True` if their respective conditions were met, and `new_marks` is a set containing all elements added during the loop iterations.**
