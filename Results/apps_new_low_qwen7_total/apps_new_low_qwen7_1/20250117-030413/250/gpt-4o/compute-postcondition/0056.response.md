The code adds `mark - y` to `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was initially a list (not a set), this operation converts `new_marks` from a list to a set and adds the value `mark - y` to it. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - y`.**
