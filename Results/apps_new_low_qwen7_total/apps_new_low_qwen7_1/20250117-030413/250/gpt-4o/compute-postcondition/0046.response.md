Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a list with an additional element `mark - y`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
