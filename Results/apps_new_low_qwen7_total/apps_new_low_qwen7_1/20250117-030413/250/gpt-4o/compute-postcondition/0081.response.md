Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean flags indicating whether their respective conditions were met, `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations, and `result` is a list. If `y_found` is `True`, `result` contains `y`; otherwise, `result` contains both `x` and `y`.***
