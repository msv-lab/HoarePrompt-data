Postcondition: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a list with the second element being `mark - x`. If `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then the function ensures that `new_marks` includes the updated second element accordingly.**
