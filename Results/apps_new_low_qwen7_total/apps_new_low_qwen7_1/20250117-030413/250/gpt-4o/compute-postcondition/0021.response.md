The line `y_found = True` sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. This does not affect the values of other variables, so the `x_found` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[2]`, `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True`, If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.**
