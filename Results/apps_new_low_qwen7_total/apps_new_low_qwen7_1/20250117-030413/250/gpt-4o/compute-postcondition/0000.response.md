The given code reads two lines of input and initializes several variables. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

1. `n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())`: This line takes four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` respectively.
2. `marks = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line takes a sequence of space-separated integers as input and converts it into a list named `marks`.
3. `marks_set = set(marks)`: This line creates a set from the `marks` list, effectively removing any duplicate values and storing it in `marks_set`.
4. `x_found = False`: This line initializes a boolean variable `x_found` to `False`.
5. `y_found = False`: This line initializes a boolean variable `y_found` to `False`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler (0 = `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` = `l`), we can summarize the final state as follows:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` will have the values of the integers read from the input.
- `marks` will be a list of integers read from the input, representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
- `marks_set` will be a set containing the unique positions from `marks`.
- `x_found` and `y_found` are both initialized to `False`.

Since no operations modify the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, or `a`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variables `x_found` and `y_found` are introduced but are not affected by any operation.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, l is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, marks is a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] < ... < marks[n-1] = l), marks_set is a set of the unique positions from marks, x_found is False, y_found is False**
