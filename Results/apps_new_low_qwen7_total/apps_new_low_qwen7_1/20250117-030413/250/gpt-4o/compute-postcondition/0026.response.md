Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[-1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. The loop has been exited because both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`. The final state of `x_found` and `y_found` indicates that `x` and `y` were found in relation to any mark in the `marks` list based on the given conditions. The `marks` and `marks_set` lists remain unchanged.***
