The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value of `mark - y` to the `new_marks` list. Since `new_marks` is initially a list, the addition operation does not modify its second element but appends the new value to the list.

- The value of `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`.
- Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list with its second element updated to `mark - y`.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list with its second element updated to `mark - y`.**
