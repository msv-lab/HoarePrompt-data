Postcondition: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list. If any of the following conditions are met: `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. The current value of `new_marks` includes `mark + x` since `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`.**
