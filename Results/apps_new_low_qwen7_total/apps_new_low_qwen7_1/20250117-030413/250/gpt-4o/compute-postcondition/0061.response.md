In the given code snippet, `new_marks.add(mark + x)` attempts to add the value of `mark + x` to the `new_marks` list. However, there are no existing values specified for `mark` or `x`, and `new_marks` is mentioned as a list, implying it already exists. Since `add` is typically used with sets, and `new_marks` is a list, we assume the intention is to append `mark + x` to `new_marks`.

Given the initial state:
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is the second element of `marks`.
- `marks_set` is any set.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is a list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `mark` remains the second element of `marks`.
- `x` remains undefined in terms of a specific value.
- `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + x`.

Since `mark` is the second element of `marks`, and `x` is not defined, the updated `new_marks` list includes `mark + x`.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a list containing `mark + x`.**
