`new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the list `new_marks`. Since `mark + y + x` is already in `marks_set`, adding `mark + y` to `new_marks` means `new_marks` now includes this value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list containing `mark + y`.**
