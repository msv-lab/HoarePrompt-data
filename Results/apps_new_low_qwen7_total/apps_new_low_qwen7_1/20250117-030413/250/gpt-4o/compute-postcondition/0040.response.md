Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list. If any of the following conditions are met: `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. In all other cases, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***

The postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and updates `y_found` to `False` as per the if condition provided.
