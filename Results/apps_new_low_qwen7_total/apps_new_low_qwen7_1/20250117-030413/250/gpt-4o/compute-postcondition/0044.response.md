Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list that remains unchanged. The if condition evaluates to either `mark - y + x in marks_set` or `mark - y - x in marks_set`***
