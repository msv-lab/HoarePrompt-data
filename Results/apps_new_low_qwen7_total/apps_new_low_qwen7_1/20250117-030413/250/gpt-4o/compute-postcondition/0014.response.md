The code `y_found = True` sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. This does not affect the value of `x_found`, `marks`, `mark`, `marks_set`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `y_found`.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True`**.
