Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[2]`, `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True`, and if both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
