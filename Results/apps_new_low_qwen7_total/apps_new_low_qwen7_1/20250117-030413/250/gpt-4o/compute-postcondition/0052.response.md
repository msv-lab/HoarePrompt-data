Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list. If `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, no changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
