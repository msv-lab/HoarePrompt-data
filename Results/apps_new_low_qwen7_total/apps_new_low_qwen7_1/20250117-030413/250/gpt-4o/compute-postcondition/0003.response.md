The variable `x_found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `marks`, `mark`, or `marks_set`. Therefore, the only change is that `x_found` is now `True`.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[0]`, either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `x_found` is `True`**
