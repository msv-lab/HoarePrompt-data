Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[0]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. The condition `(x_found and y_found)` is satisfied.***
