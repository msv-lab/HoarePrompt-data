`new_marks` is a list, and the code attempts to add `mark - x` to `new_marks`. However, since `new_marks` is a list, the `add` method does not apply; instead, a `TypeError` would occur. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list.**
