`new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the `new_marks` list. Since `new_marks` was initially a list, adding an element to a list does not affect its type but changes its content. The initial value of `mark` is the first element of `marks`, and `y` is just `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a list containing `mark + y`, and no other variables have been affected.**
