`x_found` is explicitly set to `True`. This means that the value of `x_found` is now `True`, regardless of its previous state. The values of other variables (`marks`, `mark`, `y_found`, and `marks_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[2]`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, otherwise `y_found` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.**
