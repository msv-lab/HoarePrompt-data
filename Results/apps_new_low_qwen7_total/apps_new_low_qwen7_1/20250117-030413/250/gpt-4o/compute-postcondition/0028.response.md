Postcondition: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is equal to `marks[-1]`, `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `y_found` is `True` if `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. Both `x_found` and `y_found` are not simultaneously `True`. The `marks` and `marks_set` lists remain unchanged.**
