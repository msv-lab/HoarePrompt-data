Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variable `mark` which is iterated over the list `marks`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - For each `mark` in `marks`, the loop checks if certain conditions involving `mark`, `x`, and `y` are met.
   - If these conditions are met, specific elements are added to `new_marks`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, or `new_marks` except through these conditions.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `mark` is the only variable directly modified by the loop head itself (it changes to the next element in `marks`), the state of `mark` will change.
   - `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` remain as they were before the start of the next iteration unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is the first element of `marks`.
- `marks_set` is any set.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is a list.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `mark` will be the second element of `marks` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
- `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` will retain their original values from the previous iteration unless the loop body changes them.

Since no changes are mentioned in the loop body affecting these variables, we assume they remain the same.

**Final State:**
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `mark` is the second element of `marks`.
- `marks_set` is any set.
- `x_found` is `False`.
- `y_found` is `False`.
- `new_marks` is a list.

State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the second element of `marks`, `marks_set` is any set, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a list.**
