Postcondition: ***`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks` after popping, `x_found` and `y_found` retain their original boolean values, `new_marks` is a set containing all elements added during the loop iterations except for one, and the popped element is printed. If `y_found` is False, `result` contains either 'x' and 'y'. If `y_found` is True, `result` contains only 'y' with a length of 1. Otherwise, the length of `result` is 2.***
