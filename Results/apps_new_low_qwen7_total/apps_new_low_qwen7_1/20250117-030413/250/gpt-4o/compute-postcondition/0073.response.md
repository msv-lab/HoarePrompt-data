Output State: **marks is a non-empty list, mark is the last element of marks before popping, x_found and y_found retain their original values as True, new_marks is a set containing all elements added during the loop iterations except for one, and the popped element is printed** 

Explanation: 
- The first line `print(1)` prints `1` to the console.
- The second line `print(new_marks.pop())` removes and returns an arbitrary element from `new_marks` (since `new_marks` is not empty), and then prints this element. After popping, `new_marks` contains all elements added during the loop iterations except for the one that was just removed.

The initial conditions of `marks`, `mark`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` remain unchanged except for `new_marks`, which loses one element after the pop operation. The printed output will be the element that was removed from `new_marks`.
