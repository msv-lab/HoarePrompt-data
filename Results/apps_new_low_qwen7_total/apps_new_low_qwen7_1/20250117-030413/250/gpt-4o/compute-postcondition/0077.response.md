The code `result.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `result`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `x`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` is the last element of `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is True, `new_marks` is an empty set containing all elements added during the loop iterations, `result` is a list containing `x`**
