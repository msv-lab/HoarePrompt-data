You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a ruler with `n` marks at positions specified in the list `marks`. It checks if two distances `x` and `y` can be measured using these marks. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0`. If not, it tries to find a way to measure at least one of the distances using the available marks. If both distances cannot be measured, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances. If only one distance can be measured, it prints the other distance.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the necessary new marks is flawed. Let's consider a counterexample:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
3 250 185 230
0 300 250
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
185 230
```

**Actual Output:**
The program runs but does not correctly identify that both `185` and `230` are needed as new marks. Instead, it might miss adding both marks if the conditions in the loop are not met correctly.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Logic for Determining New Marks:**
   - The program checks if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in the set of existing marks to determine if `x` can be measured. However, it doesn't fully cover all possible cases where the difference between two marks could be `x` or `y`.
   - The logic for checking and adding new marks is incomplete and might miss certain combinations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Conditions:**
   - The program attempts to add marks in a way that may not cover all necessary cases. For instance, it might miss adding `185` and `230` if the conditions in the loops are not properly structured to handle all possibilities.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of new marks needed in some scenarios, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
