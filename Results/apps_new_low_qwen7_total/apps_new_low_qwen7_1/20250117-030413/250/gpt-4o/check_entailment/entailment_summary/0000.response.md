Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the given distances \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured using the existing marks.
2. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured directly or indirectly using the existing marks, it prints `0`.
3. If either \(x\) or \(y\) can be measured but not both, it calculates and prints the necessary additional marks.
4. If neither \(x\) nor \(y\) can be measured, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances.
5. The logic for checking if a distance can be measured is implemented correctly using set operations.
6. The program handles cases where either or both distances can be measured and calculates the necessary additional marks accurately.
7. The program also handles the case where neither distance can be measured and prints the required number of additional marks.

Given the detailed implementation and the logical steps followed, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
