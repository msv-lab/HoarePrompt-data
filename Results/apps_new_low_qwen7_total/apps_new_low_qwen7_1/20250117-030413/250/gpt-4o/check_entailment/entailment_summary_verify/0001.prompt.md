You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    marks_set = set(marks)
    x_found = False
    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
            x_found = True
        if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
            y_found = True
        if x_found and y_found:
            break
    if x_found and y_found:
        print(0)
    else:
        new_marks = set()
        for mark in marks:
            if not x_found:
                if mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - x + y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + x)
                elif mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - x)
            if not y_found:
                if mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + y)
                elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(new_marks.pop())
        else:
            result = []
            if not x_found:
                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a ruler with `n` marks at positions specified in the list `marks`. It checks if two distances `x` and `y` can be measured using these marks. If both `x` and `y` can be measured, it prints `0`. If not, it tries to find a way to measure at least one of the distances using the available marks. If both distances cannot be measured, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure at least one of the distances. If only one distance can be measured, it prints the other distance.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it follows the problem specification accurately and handles all possible cases effectively.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` and initializes the marks list and marks_set from the input.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `x` or `y` can be measured directly using existing marks or through simple arithmetic operations. This part of the code is mostly correct but has some issues:
   - It checks both `mark + x` and `mark - x` (similarly for `y`). However, these checks might miss some cases due to the order of conditions and the way the loop breaks.
3. **New Marks Calculation**: The program then tries to find the minimum number of new marks needed by checking various combinations involving `x` and `y`. This part is more complex and needs careful examination:
   - The logic for adding new marks is somewhat convoluted and may not cover all edge cases efficiently.
   - The condition for adding a new mark (`if new_marks: print(1)` and subsequent logic) is flawed because it only prints one mark even if multiple marks are needed.
4. **Final Output**: The program attempts to print the required number of new marks and their positions. However, the logic for determining and printing these marks is not fully correct.

Given the complexity and the potential for missing cases, especially in the new marks calculation part, we need to verify specific scenarios to ensure the program works correctly.

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 250 185 230
     0 185 250
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1
     230
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that adding a 230 cm mark allows measuring both 185 and 230 cm.

2. **Scenario 2**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     4 250 185 230
     0 20 185 250
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that no additional marks are needed since the ruler already measures both 185 and 230 cm.

3. **Scenario 3**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     2 300 185 230
     0 300
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     185 230
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that adding both 185 and 230 cm marks are necessary.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program against the test scenarios and understanding its logic, the program appears to handle most cases correctly but has some issues with edge cases and the way it calculates and prints new marks. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct due to these potential oversights.
