Reasoning:

1. The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking if `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks or by adding new marks.
2. The main issues in the current implementation are:
   - The code does not correctly handle the addition of new marks to ensure that both `x` and `y` are measurable.
   - The logic for adding new marks is flawed and incomplete.
   - The final output is not formatted correctly to match the required output format.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
