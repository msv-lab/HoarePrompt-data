### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of \( f(i) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( m \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from 0 and never jumping outside the interval \([0, i]\).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to track the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).
   - `dp[i]` should store the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).

3. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.

4. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
     - If \( i + a \leq m \), update `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.
     - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), update `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`.

5. **Summing Up the DP Values:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of all values in the `dp` array.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Misunderstanding of \( f(i) \):**
  - The function `func()` is intended to calculate the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \). However, the current implementation is actually counting the number of ways to sum up to `i` using multiples of `a` and `b`, which is a different problem.
  - The problem statement asks for the number of distinct positions, not the number of ways to sum up to a position.

- **Incorrect Update Logic:**
  - The logic in the `for` loop is meant to update the DP array based on the number of ways to reach a position, not the number of distinct positions.
  - For example, consider the example \( m = 7 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 3 \):
    - \( dp[0] = 1 \)
    - \( dp[5] = dp[0] = 1 \) (since \( 0 + 5 \leq 7 \))
    - \( dp[3] = dp[0] = 1 \) (since \( 0 - 3 \geq 0 \))
    - \( dp[8] = dp[5] = 1 \) (but 8 is out of bounds, so this is incorrect)
    - This incorrect update logic leads to wrong values in the `dp` array.

- **Summing Up Distinct Positions:**
  - The sum of the `dp` array will give the number of ways to sum up to `m` using `a` and `b`, not the number of distinct positions.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the problem, we need to use a different approach:
1. **Use a set to keep track of distinct positions:**
   - Initialize an empty set `positions`.
   - Start from position 0 and use a loop to explore all reachable positions up to `m`.
   - Add each new position to the set if it is within the interval \([0, m]\).
   - The size of the set will give the number of distinct positions `f(i)` for each `i`.

2. **Sum the sizes of the sets for each `i` from 0 to `m`:**

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem as described. It counts the number of ways to sum up to `i` using `a` and `b`, not the number of distinct positions.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
