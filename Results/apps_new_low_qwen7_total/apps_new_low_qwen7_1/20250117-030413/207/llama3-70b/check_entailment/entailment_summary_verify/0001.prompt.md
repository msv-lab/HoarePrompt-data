You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program:
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func()` accepts three non-negative integer inputs `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It calculates the number of ways to sum up to `m` using multiples of `a` and/or `b` starting from 0. The function initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `i` using `a` and `b`. The base case is set to `dp[0] = 1`. For each index `i` from 0 to `m`, the function updates `dp[i]` by adding the values of `dp[i - b]` and `dp[i - a]` if the indices are within bounds. After the loop, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to sum up to `m` using `a` and `b`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `m` is 0, the function will return 1 because `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the function will handle these cases correctly since the loop updates `dp[i]` appropriately for such values.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle negative values for `m`, `a`, or `b`. However, given the constraints, the inputs are guaranteed to be non-negative and within the specified ranges.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).
   - The frog can move to \( k+a \) or \( k-b \) from position \( k \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct positions reachable from each position up to \( m \).
   - `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).

3. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.

4. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
     - If \( i + a \leq m \), update `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.
     - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), update `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`.

5. **Summing Up the DP Values:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of all values in the `dp` array.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The given implementation handles the constraints correctly, including edge cases like when the frog cannot make any jumps (`b == 1` and `a > m`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes the DP array appropriately, updates the values based on possible jumps, and sums up the results correctly.
