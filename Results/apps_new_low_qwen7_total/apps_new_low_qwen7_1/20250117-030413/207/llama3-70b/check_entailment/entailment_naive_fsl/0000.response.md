Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to solve the problem by using dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct positions the frog can reach up to each position `i`. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` should be `dp[i + b] += dp[i]` to correctly update the count of reachable positions when the frog jumps forward by `b`. Additionally, the program should handle the case where the frog cannot make any jumps, which would result in `dp[i]` being 0 for all `i`.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
100 100000 1
```

The program will output `101`, but the correct output should be `101` because the frog can only reach positions `0` and `1` if `a = 100000` and `b = 1`. The frog cannot make any jumps since `a` is much larger than `b`, and jumping back by `b` would still leave it within the interval `[0, m]`. Therefore, the correct count of distinct positions the frog can reach for each `i` from `0` to `100` is `1` (only `0`), leading to a sum of `101`.

The program does not handle this edge case correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
