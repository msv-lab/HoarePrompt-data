You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

dp = [0] * (m + 1)

dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is m_val, a is a_val, b is b_val, and dp is a list of length m_val + 1 where each element dp[i] represents the number of ways to sum up to i using multiples of a and/or b starting from 0. Specifically, dp[0] is 1 (base case), and for any i from 1 to m_val, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - b] and dp[i - a] if both indices are valid, otherwise dp[i] remains 0.
    print(sum(dp))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).
   - The frog can move to \( k+a \) or \( k-b \) from position \( k \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct positions reachable from each position up to \( m \).
   - `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).

3. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.

4. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
     - If \( i + a \leq m \), update `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.
     - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), update `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`.

5. **Summing Up the DP Values:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of all values in the `dp` array.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The given implementation handles the constraints correctly, including edge cases like when the frog cannot make any jumps (`b == 1` and `a > m`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes the DP array appropriately, updates the values based on possible jumps, and sums up the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
