### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's revisit the problem and the code with the provided annotations.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The frog starts at position 0 and can jump to \( k+a \) or \( k-b \).
   - We need to find the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).

3. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.

4. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
     - If \( i + a \leq m \), update `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.
     - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), update `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`.

5. **Summing Up the DP Values:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of all values in the `dp` array.

### Key Points to Verify:
- **Initialization:** `dp[0] = 1` is correct.
- **Update Logic:** The logic for updating `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i - b]` ensures that all reachable positions are accounted for.
- **Edge Cases:** The implementation handles the constraints correctly, including edge cases like when the frog cannot make any jumps (`b == 1` and `a > m`).

### Analysis with Annotated Code:
- **Before Function Call:**
  - \( m \) is a non-negative integer.
  - \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers.
- **After Function Call:**
  - `dp` is a list of length \( m + 1 \).
  - Each element `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \( i \) using multiples of \( a \) and/or \( b \) starting from 0.
  - The base case `dp[0] = 1` is correctly set.
  - The loop updates `dp[i]` by considering both possible jumps \( i + a \) and \( i - b \) if within bounds.
  - After the loop, the sum of all elements in `dp` is printed.

### Edge Cases:
- **When \( m = 0 \):** `dp[0]` is 1, and the sum is 1.
- **When \( a = 1 \) or \( b = 1 \):** The frog can make small jumps, and the logic correctly handles these cases.
- **When \( b > m \) and \( a > m \):** The frog cannot make any jumps, and the logic correctly handles this by setting `dp[i] = 0` for all \( i > 0 \).

### Missing Functionality:
- The code does not explicitly handle negative values for `m`, `a`, or `b`. However, given the constraints, the inputs are guaranteed to be non-negative and within the specified ranges.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes the DP array appropriately, updates the values based on possible jumps, and sums up the results correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
