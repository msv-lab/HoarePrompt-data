You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

dp = [0] * (m + 1)

dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is m_val, a is a_val, b is b_val, and dp is a list of length m_val + 1 where each element dp[i] represents the number of ways to sum up to i using multiples of a and/or b starting from 0. Specifically, dp[0] is 1 (base case), and for any i from 1 to m_val, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - b] and dp[i - a] if both indices are valid, otherwise dp[i] remains 0.
    print(sum(dp))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts three non-negative integer inputs `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It calculates the number of ways to sum up to `m` using multiples of `a` and/or `b` starting from 0. The function initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `i` using `a` and `b`. The base case is set to `dp[0] = 1`. For each index `i` from 0 to `m`, the function updates `dp[i]` by adding the values of `dp[i - b]` and `dp[i - a]` if the indices are within bounds. After the loop, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to sum up to `m` using `a` and `b`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `m` is 0, the function will return 1 because `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the function will handle these cases correctly since the loop updates `dp[i]` appropriately for such values.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle negative values for `m`, `a`, or `b`. However, given the constraints, the inputs are guaranteed to be non-negative and within the specified ranges.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to solve the problem by using dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct positions the frog can reach up to each position `i`. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` should be `dp[i + b] += dp[i]` to correctly update the count of reachable positions when the frog jumps forward by `b`. Additionally, the program should handle the case where the frog cannot make any jumps, which would result in `dp[i]` being 0 for all `i`.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input:
```
100 100000 1
```

The program will output `101`, but the correct output should be `101` because the frog can only reach positions `0` and `1` if `a = 100000` and `b = 1`. The frog cannot make any jumps since `a` is much larger than `b`, and jumping back by `b` would still leave it within the interval `[0, m]`. Therefore, the correct count of distinct positions the frog can reach for each `i` from `0` to `100` is `1` (only `0`), leading to a sum of `101`.

The program does not handle this edge case correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
