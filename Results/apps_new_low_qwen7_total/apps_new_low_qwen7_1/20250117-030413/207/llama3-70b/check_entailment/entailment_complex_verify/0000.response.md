### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each integer `i` from `0` to `m`. This involves dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct positions the frog can reach up to position `i`.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` with `dp[0] = 1`.
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `m`, it updates `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i]` based on whether `i + a` and `i - b` are within bounds.
   - The logic in the annotated code correctly describes the state transitions, updating `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i]` based on the previous states `dp[i]` and `dp[i - b]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: When `m` is `0`, the function returns `1` correctly as `dp[0]` is `1`.
   - **Case 2**: When `a` or `b` is `1`, the function handles these cases correctly because the loop updates `dp[i]` appropriately for such values.
   - **Case 3**: The program correctly handles the scenario where the frog cannot make any jumps if `a` is much larger than `b`, as demonstrated in the provided example. In this case, the frog can only reach `0` and `1`, leading to `dp[i] = 1` for all `i` from `0` to `100`, resulting in the correct sum of `101`.

4. **Original Assessment Reevaluation**:
   - The original assessment states that the logic is flawed because `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` should be `dp[i + b] += dp[i]`. However, the annotated code and the problem description clearly show that `dp[i]` is updated correctly when `i - b` is within bounds.
   - The edge case handling for when the frog cannot make any jumps is also correctly implemented in the annotated code.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The annotated code accurately reflects the intended logic and handles all edge cases properly.
   - The original assessment was incorrect because it misinterpreted the logic in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
