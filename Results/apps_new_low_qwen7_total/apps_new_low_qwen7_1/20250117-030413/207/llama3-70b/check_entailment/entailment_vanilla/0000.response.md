### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).
   - The frog can move to \( k+a \) or \( k-b \) from position \( k \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct positions reachable from each position up to \( m \).
   - `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to position \( i \).

3. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.

4. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each position \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
     - If \( i + a \leq m \), update `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.
     - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), update `dp[i] += dp[i - b]`.

5. **Summing Up the DP Values:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of all values in the `dp` array.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The given implementation handles the constraints correctly, including edge cases like when the frog cannot make any jumps (`b == 1` and `a > m`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes the DP array appropriately, updates the values based on possible jumps, and sums up the results correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
