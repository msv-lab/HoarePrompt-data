The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. The initial state of `dp` is such that it is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` which is 1. We need to determine the impact of this operation on the `dp` list.

Since the code does not specify a particular value for `i`, we assume that `i` is an index within the bounds of the `dp` list (0 to `m_val`). Given the initial state, the only non-zero element in `dp` is `dp[0]` which is 1. For any other index `i`, `dp[i]` is initially 0. The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` will only affect `dp[i]` if `i - b` is a valid index and `dp[i - b]` is not zero. However, since `dp[0]` is the only non-zero element and `dp[i - b]` would be `dp[0]` only when `i - b = 0` (i.e., `i = b`), the only case where this update can occur is when `i = b`.

Let's consider the case when `i = b`:
- Initially, `dp[b]` is 0.
- After the update, `dp[b]` becomes `dp[b] + dp[b - b] = 0 + dp[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`.

For all other indices, `dp[i]` remains 0 because `dp[i - b]` would be 0 unless `i - b = 0`, which is not possible for other indices.

Therefore, the updated state of `dp` is:
- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- `dp[b]` becomes 1.
- All other elements of `dp` remain 0.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[b]` is 1, and all other elements of `dp` are 0.**
