Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `m` is `m_val`
   - `a` is `a_val`
   - `b` is `b_val`
   - `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.
   - The condition for updating `dp` is: if `i - b >= 0` and `i + a <= m_val`, then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged, and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `m` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `dp`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since we are starting the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The conditions `i - b >= 0` and `i + a <= m_val` will be checked.
   - If these conditions are met, `dp[a_val]` will be set to 1, otherwise, it will remain unchanged.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is currently `i_val` (where `i_val` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `m` is `m_val`.
- `a` is `a_val`.
- `b` is `b_val`.
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_val + 1`.
- We need to check the conditions `i_val + 1 - b >= 0` and `i_val + 1 + a <= m_val`.
- If both conditions are true, `dp[a_val]` will be set to 1.
- Otherwise, it will remain unchanged.
- `dp[i_val + 1]` will be updated to `dp[i_val + 1] + dp[i_val + 1 - b]`.

Since the loop only updates the state based on the value of `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `dp`, and these values are determined by the loop itself, we can directly state the adjustments needed for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1. If `i_val + 1 - b >= 0` and `i_val + 1 + a <= m_val`, then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged, and `dp[i_val + 1]` is updated to `dp[i_val + 1] + dp[i_val + 1 - b]`.**
