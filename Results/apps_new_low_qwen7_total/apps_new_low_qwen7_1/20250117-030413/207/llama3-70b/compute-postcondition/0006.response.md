The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]` to it. Given the initial conditions:

- `m` is `m_val`
- `a` is `a_val`
- `b` is `b_val`
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.
- If `i + a <= m_val` then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged.
- The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `b_val`.

Since `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is executed, the value of `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]`. There is no specific value given for `i` other than it being greater than or equal to `b_val`, so we will keep it as `i`.

The output state will be:

- `m` is `m_val`
- `a` is `a_val`
- `b` is `b_val`
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.
- If `i + a <= m_val` then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged.
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1, if `i + a <= m_val` then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.**
