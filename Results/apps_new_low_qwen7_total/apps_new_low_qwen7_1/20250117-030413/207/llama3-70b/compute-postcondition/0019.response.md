The code `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp`. This sum is printed to the console, but the actual value of the sum is not stored anywhere in the program. The variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the sum of `dp` is computed and printed.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, and `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where each element `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `i` using multiples of `a` and/or `b` starting from 0; specifically, `dp[0]` is 1 (base case), and for any `i` from 1 to `m_val`, `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - b]` and `dp[i - a]` if both indices are valid, otherwise `dp[i]` remains 0; the sum of `dp` is printed.**
