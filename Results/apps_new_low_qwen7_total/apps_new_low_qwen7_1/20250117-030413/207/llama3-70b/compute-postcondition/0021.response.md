Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three non-negative integer inputs `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It calculates the number of ways to sum up to `m` using multiples of `a` and/or `b` starting from 0. The function initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `i` using `a` and `b`. The base case is set to `dp[0] = 1`. For each index `i` from 0 to `m`, the function updates `dp[i]` by adding the values of `dp[i - b]` and `dp[i - a]` if the indices are within bounds. After the loop, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to sum up to `m` using `a` and `b`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `m` is 0, the function will return 1 because `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the function will handle these cases correctly since the loop updates `dp[i]` appropriately for such values.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle negative values for `m`, `a`, or `b`. However, given the constraints, the inputs are guaranteed to be non-negative and within the specified ranges.**

Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it outputs the total number of ways to sum up to `m` using multiples of `a` and/or `b`.
