The provided code reads three integers from the input, assigns them to `m`, `a`, and `b`, and initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0. It then sets the first element of `dp` (i.e., `dp[0]`) to 1.

Since the initial values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not specified in the question, we will denote them as generic values `m_val`, `a_val`, and `b_val` where \(1 \leq m_val \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a_val, b_val \leq 10^5\).

After executing the given code, the state of the variables and the list `dp` will be:
- `m` is equal to `m_val`
- `a` is equal to `a_val`
- `b` is equal to `b_val`
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[0]` which is set to 1.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **m is m_val, a is a_val, b is b_val, dp is a list of length m_val + 1 with all elements 0 except dp[0] is 1**
