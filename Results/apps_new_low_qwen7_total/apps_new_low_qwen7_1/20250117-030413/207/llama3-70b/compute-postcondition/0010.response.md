Postcondition: ***`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, and `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1. If `i + a` is within bounds (i.e., `i + a <= m`), then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged. In either case, `dp[i + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`.***
