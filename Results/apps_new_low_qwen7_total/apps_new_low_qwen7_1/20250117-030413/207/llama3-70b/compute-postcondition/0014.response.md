Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `m` is `m_val`
   - `a` is `a_val`
   - `b` is `b_val`
   - `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   dp[i + a] += dp[i]
   ```

3. This line of code updates `dp[i + a]` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. 

4. To determine the exact impact, we need to know the value of `i`. However, since `i` is not specified in the problem, we can only say that `dp[i + a]` will be updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.

5. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, and the rest of the `dp` list) remain unchanged unless `i` is such that it affects them.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `m` is `m_val`
- `a` is `a_val`
- `b` is `b_val`
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[i + a]` is updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[i + a]` is updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.**
