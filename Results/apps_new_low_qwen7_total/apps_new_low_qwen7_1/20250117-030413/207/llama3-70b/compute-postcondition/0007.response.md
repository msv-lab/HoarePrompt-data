Postcondition: ***`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1. If `i - b >= 0` and `i + a <= m_val`, then `dp[a_val]` is set to 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged, and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.***
