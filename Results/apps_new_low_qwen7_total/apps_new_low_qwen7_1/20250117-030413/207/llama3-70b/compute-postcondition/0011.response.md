The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. This means the value of `dp[i]` will now be the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - b]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

To determine the new state, we need to know the value of `i` in the context of the current iteration. However, since the value of `i` is not explicitly provided, we'll consider the general impact on the `dp` list.

Let's assume the current index `i` is within the bounds of the `dp` list, which is of length `m_val + 1` and all elements are initially 0 except `dp[0]` which is 1.

The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` will add the value of `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that the value of `dp[i]` is updated according to the rule described.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, and `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1. Additionally, for the current index `i`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.**
