The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + a_val]` by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given the initial conditions:

- `m` is `m_val`
- `a` is `a_val`
- `b` is `b_val`
- `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1
- `i` is 0
- The condition `(i + a_val <= m_val)` is true

Let's break down the changes:

1. The value of `i` is 0.
2. The value of `a` is `a_val`.
3. Therefore, `i + a_val` equals `0 + a_val`, which is `a_val`.

The code snippet modifies the `dp` list at index `a_val` by adding `dp[0]` to it. Since `dp[0]` is 1, the value of `dp[a_val]` will be updated to `dp[a_val] + 1`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[a_val]` is 1, `i` is 0**
