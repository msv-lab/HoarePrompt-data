The function `func` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). 

There are two cases based on the output:
- Case_1: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). If a certain condition is met (not specified in the given information), the function returns a specific value.
- Case_2: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). If a different condition is met (not specified in the given information), the function returns a different specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` and return a specific value based on certain conditions that are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. Based on certain conditions, it returns a specific value.**
