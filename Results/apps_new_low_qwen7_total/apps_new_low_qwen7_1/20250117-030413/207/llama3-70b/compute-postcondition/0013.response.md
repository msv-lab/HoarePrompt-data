Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - `m` is `m_val`.
   - `a` is `a_val`.
   - `b` is `b_val`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = m_val`.

3. **Analyze the loop body:**
   - For each `i`, if `i - b >= 0`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `m` is `m_val`.
   - `a` is `a_val`.
   - `b` is `b_val`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `previous_i`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `previous_i < m_val`.
   - If `previous_i < m_val`, then `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - If `previous_i + 1 - b >= 0`, then `dp[previous_i + 1]` will be updated to `dp[previous_i + 1] + dp[previous_i + 1 - b]`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `m` remains `m_val`.
   - `a` remains `a_val`.
   - `b` remains `b_val`.
   - `dp` will be updated according to the loop body.

Since the only variables that change inside the loop are `i` and the elements of `dp`, and since we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, we focus on these changes.

### Final Answer:
If `previous_i < m_val`, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
- `dp` will be updated based on the loop body.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, and `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` where all elements are 0 except `dp[0]` is 1. For the current index `i`, if `i - b >= 0`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`. If the previous `i` was `previous_i`, then `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.**
