The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]`. Based on the precondition, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[0]` which is 1. The condition for updating `dp[i + a]` is given by `i_val + 1 - b >= 0` and `i_val + 1 + a <= m_val`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. The value of `dp[i_val + a]` is updated to `dp[i_val + a] + dp[i_val + 1]`.

2. The precondition states that `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.

Given this, we need to consider the specific values:

- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- All other elements in `dp` remain 0 unless explicitly changed by the code.
- The update happens only if the conditions `i_val + 1 - b >= 0` and `i_val + 1 + a <= m_val` are met.

Since the exact values of `i_val`, `a_val`, `b_val`, and `m_val` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dp[i_val + a]` without knowing these specific values. However, we know that before the update, `dp[i_val + a]` was 0 (since all elements are initially 0).

Thus, after the update:
- `dp[i_val + a]` becomes `dp[i_val + 1]`.

Output State: **`m` is `m_val`, `a` is `a_val`, `b` is `b_val`, `dp` is a list of length `m_val + 1` with all elements 0 except `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[i_val + a]` is `dp[i_val + 1]`.**
