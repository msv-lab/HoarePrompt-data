The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\)). It checks whether for all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is unique. If any remainder is repeated before the loop completes, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.
