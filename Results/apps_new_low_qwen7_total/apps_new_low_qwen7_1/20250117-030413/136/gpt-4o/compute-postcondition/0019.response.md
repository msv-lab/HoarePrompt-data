The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since `seen_remainders` was initially a set containing `{remainder}`, adding the same `remainder` to the set does not change its contents. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `k` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` contains `{remainder}`, and the function does not return anything new regarding `seen_remainders`.**
