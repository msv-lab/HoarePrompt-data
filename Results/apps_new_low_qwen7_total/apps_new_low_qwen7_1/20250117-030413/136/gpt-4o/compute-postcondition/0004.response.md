Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `k`.
   - The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `k`, and implicitly `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, k]`.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is `1` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` should be `1` for the loop to start its first iteration.

4. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` must be at least `1` because the loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i > k`. Given the constraints `1 ≤ k < n` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` must be a positive integer less than `n`.

5. **Consider the Value of `n`:**
   - While `n` itself is not directly involved in the loop condition, it provides an upper bound for `k` (since `k < n`).

6. **Verify Other Variables:**
   - The variable `seen_remainders` is not involved in the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

Based on the above analysis, the state of the objects at the start of the loop must satisfy the following conditions:
- `i` must be `1`.
- `k` must be at least `1` and less than `n`.

Given the initial values:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).

Thus, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1 and less than `n`, `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
