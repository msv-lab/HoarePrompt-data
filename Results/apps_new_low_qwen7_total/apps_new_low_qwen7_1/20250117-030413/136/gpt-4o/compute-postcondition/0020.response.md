Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders of `n % i` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, and the function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are found in `seen_remainders` at any point during the loop. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function does not return anything and continues until all possible `i` values are checked.

To summarize:
- The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- The variable `k` remains constant throughout the loop.
- The variable `seen_remainders` accumulates remainders of `n % i` for each iteration.
- The loop executes `k` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.

If any `remainder` found in `seen_remainders` repeats (i.e., `remainder` is already in `seen_remainders`), the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after completing all iterations, the function does not return anything explicitly but retains the final state of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders of `n % i` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, and the function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are found in `seen_remainders` at any point during the loop.**
