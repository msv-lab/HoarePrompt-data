Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\)). It checks whether for all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is unique. If any remainder is repeated before the loop completes, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function immediately returns 'No'.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 'Yes' because the only possible remainder is 0 when divided by any `i` in the range from 1 to `k-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation suggests that the function checks for uniqueness of remainders, but the actual code does not handle the case where `n` is 0. In this case, the function should also return 'No' because the remainder of 0 divided by any non-zero `i` is 0, which would violate the condition of having unique remainders.
