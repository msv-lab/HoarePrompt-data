The code initializes a set named `seen_remainders`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `seen_remainders` set.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
