The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function has multiple return cases, but all of them return 'No' except for one case which returns 'Yes'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `n` and `k` and return 'Yes' under specific conditions, while returning 'No' in all other cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 'Yes' under specific conditions, while returning 'No' in all other cases.**
