`seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `seen_remainders`, it is assumed to be an empty set initially. After adding `remainder` to the set, the set now contains at least one element, which is `remainder`. The value of `i` remains 2, and `k` and `seen_remainders` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` contains `{remainder}`, and the program returns 'No' if `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`. Otherwise, no change in the program state is observed since there is no action specified in the else part.**
