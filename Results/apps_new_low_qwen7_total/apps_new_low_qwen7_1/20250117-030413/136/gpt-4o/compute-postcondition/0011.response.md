The code snippet updates the value of `i` to 2 for the next iteration. The remainder is calculated using the current value of `i`. Since the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder` within the loop body, these variables remain unchanged from their previous values.

The calculation for `remainder` is:
\[ \text{remainder} = n \% i \]

Given that `i` is now 2, the updated state is:
- `i` is 2
- `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder` remain unchanged from their previous values

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` remains unchanged, `remainder` is \( n \% 2 \)**
