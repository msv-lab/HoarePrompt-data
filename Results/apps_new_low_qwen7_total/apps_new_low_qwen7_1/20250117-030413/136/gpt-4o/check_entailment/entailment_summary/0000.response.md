Reasoning:  
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. It calls the function `func_1` with these values.
3. The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it immediately returns 'No' because the remainder of `n` divided by `n` itself is always 0, and this will not be distinct from other remainders if `k` is at least `n`.
4. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered during the iteration.
5. For each integer `i` from 1 to `k`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
6. If the remainder has already been seen (i.e., it exists in `seen_remainders`), it means the remainders are not all distinct, and the function returns 'No'.
7. Otherwise, the remainder is added to `seen_remainders`.
8. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

This approach ensures that all possible remainders are checked, and the uniqueness of each remainder is verified efficiently using a set.

Given the logic and implementation match the problem statement perfectly, the program is correct.
