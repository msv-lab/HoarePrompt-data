Reasoning:

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine if all remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
2. It checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it immediately returns 'No' because there would be at least one duplicate remainder.
3. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
4. It iterates over all integers from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
5. For each remainder, it checks if the remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'.
6. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
7. If no duplicates are found during the iteration, it returns 'Yes'.

This logic ensures that all remainders are checked against previously seen remainders, and the program correctly handles the condition where \( k \geq n \).

Given this analysis, the provided code matches the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
