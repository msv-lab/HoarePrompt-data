### Reasoning:

The provided code indeed correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points and verify the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if \( k \geq n \). This is a crucial optimization since if \( k \geq n \), then \( n \mod i \) will always be 0 for \( i \geq n \), and thus the remainders cannot be distinct. The function immediately returns 'No' if this condition is met.

3. **Tracking Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders encountered during the iteration. This is efficient because sets have average O(1) time complexity for membership tests and insertions.

4. **Iterating Over Range**: The program iterates over all integers from 1 to \( k \) and calculates the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \). It checks if this remainder has already been seen. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No' immediately.

5. **Returning Result**: If no duplicate remainders are found during the iteration, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The function summary provided aligns perfectly with the implementation details. The code accurately implements the logic to check for distinct remainders and handles edge cases appropriately.

Given this detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
