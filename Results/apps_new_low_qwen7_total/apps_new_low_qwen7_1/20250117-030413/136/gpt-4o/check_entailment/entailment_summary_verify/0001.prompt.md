You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\)). It checks whether for all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is unique. If any remainder is repeated before the loop completes, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine if all remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here’s the breakdown:

1. The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
2. It checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it immediately returns 'No' because there would be at least one duplicate remainder.
3. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
4. It iterates over all integers from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
5. For each remainder, it checks if the remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'.
6. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
7. If no duplicates are found during the iteration, it returns 'Yes'.

This logic ensures that all remainders are checked against previously seen remainders, and the program correctly handles the condition where \( k \geq n \).

Given this analysis, the provided code matches the problem requirements accurately.
