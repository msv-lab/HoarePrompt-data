### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program's functionality. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly checks if \( k \geq n \) and returns 'No' immediately if this condition is met. This is because when \( k \geq n \), at least one remainder will be zero (specifically, when \( i = n \)), making it impossible for all remainders to be distinct.

2. **Remainder Calculation and Tracking**: The program uses a set (`seen_remainders`) to track the remainders encountered during the iteration over \( i \) from 1 to \( k \). If a remainder is found to be in the set, the function correctly returns 'No' because it indicates a duplicate remainder.

3. **Loop Completion**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), the program is efficient because it only iterates up to \( k \) and uses a set for constant-time lookups and insertions. The implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description and the provided function summary.

Therefore, the original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and its correctness.

### Final:
**True**
