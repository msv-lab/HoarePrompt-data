Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns 'No' because there would be at least one remainder that is zero (when \( i = n \)), which means the remainders cannot be distinct. This handles the edge case where \( k \) is large compared to \( n \).

2. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered so far.

3. For each \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), it calculates the remainder \( n \% i \). If this remainder is already in the set, it immediately returns 'No' because the remainders are not distinct. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.

4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description.
