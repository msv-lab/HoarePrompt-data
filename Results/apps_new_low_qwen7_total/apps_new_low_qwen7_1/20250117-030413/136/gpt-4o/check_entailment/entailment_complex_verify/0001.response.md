### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and its logic step-by-step based on the provided annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if \( k \geq n \). This is a crucial optimization. If \( k \geq n \), then \( n \% i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) will include \( n \% n \), which is always 0. Since 0 is a possible remainder, and there are multiple values of \( i \) (specifically, \( i = 1 \) and \( i = n \)) for which \( n \% i = 0 \), this check ensures that we don't need to continue the loop if \( k \geq n \). Hence, the program correctly returns 'No' without further processing.

3. **Set Initialization and Loop:**
   - A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of the remainders.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \), calculating \( n \% i \) for each \( i \).
   - For each calculated remainder, the program checks if it is already in `seen_remainders`.
     - If the remainder is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No' immediately, indicating that the remainders are not distinct.
     - If the remainder is not found, it is added to `seen_remainders`.

4. **Final Return:**
   - After the loop completes, if no duplicate remainders were found, the function returns 'Yes'.

Given the above steps, let's consider some edge cases:

- **Edge Case: \( k \geq n \)**
  - As discussed, if \( k \geq n \), the program correctly returns 'No' without further processing. This is because the remainders will include 0, which cannot be unique since both \( n \% n \) and \( n \% 1 \) will yield 0.

- **General Case: \( k < n \)**
  - The program correctly checks each remainder and ensures they are unique. If any remainder repeats, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Based on the provided logic and edge cases, the program correctly implements the requirement to check if all remainders \( n \% i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders \( n \% i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.

**Final:** True
