Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires checking if all remainders of \( n \) when divided by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. The input consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and the output should be "Yes" if the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

2. **Initial Assessment**: The initial assessment claims that the program is correct. Let's break down the program to verify its correctness step-by-step.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly checks if \( k \geq n \) and returns "No" immediately. This is a valid edge case because if \( k \geq n \), at least one remainder will be 0 (specifically when \( i = n \)), making it impossible for all remainders to be distinct.
   - **Set Initialization and Iteration**: The function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to store remainders. It then iterates over the range from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder \( n \% i \) for each \( i \).
     - If the remainder is already in the set, the function returns "No".
     - Otherwise, the remainder is added to the set.
   - **Final Return Statement**: After the loop, if no duplicates were found, the function returns "Yes".

4. **Annotations Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and logic of the function.
   - The function handles the edge case \( k \geq n \) appropriately.
   - The loop correctly checks for duplicates using a set, ensuring that each remainder is unique if the loop completes without returning "No".

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles edge cases properly.
   - The use of a set ensures efficient and correct checking of remainders.

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks if all remainders are distinct and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
