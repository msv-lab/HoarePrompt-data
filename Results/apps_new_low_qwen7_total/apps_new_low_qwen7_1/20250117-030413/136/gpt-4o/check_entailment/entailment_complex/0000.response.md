Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from 1 to `k` are distinct.

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are non-negative integers and within the specified range (1 to \(10^{18}\)).
2. The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it immediately returns `'No'`, because the remainders modulo `n` and `n` itself will not be distinct.
3. If `k` is less than `n`, the function uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered while iterating through the range from 1 to `k`.
4. For each `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
5. If the calculated remainder is already in the `seen_remainders` set, the function immediately returns `'No'` indicating that the remainders are not all distinct.
6. If the remainder is not in the set, it adds the remainder to the set and continues the loop.
7. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns `'Yes'`.

This approach ensures that all possible remainders are checked and that the uniqueness of remainders is verified efficiently using a set, which guarantees constant time complexity for insertions and lookups.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements the logic and is correct based on the problem statement and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
