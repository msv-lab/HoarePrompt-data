Reasoning:

1. The problem requires checking if all remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes the necessary variables and logic to achieve this:
   - It splits the input into \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \geq n \), which would imply at least one duplicate remainder (since the smallest possible remainder when dividing by any number is 0, and \( n \mod n = 0 \)). If true, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - It then iterates over all values of \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder \( n \mod i \) and checking if it has already been seen. If a duplicate is found, it returns 'No'.
   - If no duplicates are found after the loop completes, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the logic and the state transitions described in the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the code.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
