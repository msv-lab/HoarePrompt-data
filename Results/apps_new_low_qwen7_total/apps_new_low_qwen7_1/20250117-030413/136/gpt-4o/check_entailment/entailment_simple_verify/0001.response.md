### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This part is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if \( k \geq n \).
   - If true, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - This check is necessary because if \( k \geq n \), the remainders will start repeating since the possible remainders when dividing by \( n \) or larger values will be the same as those for smaller values. This part is correct.

3. **Initialization and Iteration:**
   - A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of the remainders.
   - The program iterates over all integers from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
   - For each remainder, it checks if the remainder has already been seen.
     - If the remainder has already been seen, it returns 'No'.
     - If the remainder is new, it adds it to the set `seen_remainders`.
   - After the loop, if no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Annotations and Logic Flow:**
   - The annotations provided match the logical flow of the program.
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, indicating that the program maintains a set of seen remainders and checks for duplicates correctly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \geq n \) correctly.
   - The program iterates through all integers from 1 to \( k \) and checks for duplicates efficiently using a set.
   - The use of a set ensures that the program can quickly check if a remainder has been seen before.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and matches the problem requirements accurately.
