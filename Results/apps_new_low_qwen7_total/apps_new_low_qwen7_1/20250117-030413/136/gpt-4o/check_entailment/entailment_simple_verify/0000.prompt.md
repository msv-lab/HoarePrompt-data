You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and k is less than n
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders of `n % i` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, and the function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are found in `seen_remainders` at any point during the loop.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns 'No' because there would be at least one remainder that is zero (when \( i = n \)), which means the remainders cannot be distinct. This handles the edge case where \( k \) is large compared to \( n \).

2. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered so far.

3. For each \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), it calculates the remainder \( n \% i \). If this remainder is already in the set, it immediately returns 'No' because the remainders are not distinct. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.

4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description.
