### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and verify its correctness against the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - `(n, k) = map(int, input().split())`: This line correctly parses the input into integers `n` and `k`.
   - `print(func_1(n, k))`: This calls the function `func_1` with the parsed values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Initial Check:**
     - `if k >= n: return 'No'`: This checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If true, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k >= n`, then `n % k` will always be `n`, leading to a non-distinct set of remainders (since `n % n = 0` and `n % k` will also include `n`).
   - **Initialization and Loop:**
     - `seen_remainders = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store the remainders.
     - `for i in range(1, k + 1):`: Loops through each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
       - `remainder = n % i`: Calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`.
       - `if remainder in seen_remainders: return 'No'`: Checks if the remainder is already in the set. If yes, it returns 'No' immediately because the remainders are not distinct.
       - `seen_remainders.add(remainder)`: Adds the remainder to the set.
   - **Return Statement:**
     - `return 'Yes'`: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes'.

### Validation with Annotations:
- The annotation correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
- The logic inside the function `func_1` accurately follows the steps described in the original assessment.
- The set `seen_remainders` ensures that we only consider distinct remainders.
- The initial check for `k >= n` is handled correctly and early exits the function if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. The original assessment accurately identifies this and provides a correct explanation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
