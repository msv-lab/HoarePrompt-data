The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, it increases `l` by the minimum value between `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, it increases `r` by the minimum value between `a` and `l - r`. After adjusting `l` and `r`, it updates `a` to be `a` minus the value used for adjustment. Finally, it calculates `max_team_size` as `l + r + a`, ensuring that `max_team_size` is even by subtracting 1 if necessary. The function then prints the final value of `max_team_size`.
