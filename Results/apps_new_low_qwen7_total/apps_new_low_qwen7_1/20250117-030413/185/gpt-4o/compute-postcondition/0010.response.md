`max_team_size` is decremented by 1. Since `max_team_size` was initially `l + r + a` and is odd, decrementing it by 1 will make it even. The values of `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the initial value, `r` is the initial value, `a` is the initial value, `max_team_size` is `l + r + a - 1` and is even.**
