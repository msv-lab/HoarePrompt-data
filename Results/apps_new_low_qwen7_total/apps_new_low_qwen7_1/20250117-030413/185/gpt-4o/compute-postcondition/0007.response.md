Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, and `a` are integers. If `l < r`, then `l` is increased by the minimum value between `a` and `r - l`, `a` remains unchanged (since it is less than or equal to 0), and `r` remains the same as the initial value. Otherwise (`r >= l`), `r` is updated to `r + \min(a, l - r)` and `a` is updated to `a - \min(a, l - r)`.***
