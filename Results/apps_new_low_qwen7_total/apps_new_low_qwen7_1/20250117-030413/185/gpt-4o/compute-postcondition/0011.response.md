Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `a` are the initial values. `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is odd, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to be even by subtracting 1 from it. The final value of `max_team_size` will be either the original value minus 1 (if it was odd) or the original value (if it was already even).***
