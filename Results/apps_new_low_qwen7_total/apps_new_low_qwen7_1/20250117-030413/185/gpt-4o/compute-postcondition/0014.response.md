Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, it increases `l` by the minimum value between `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, it increases `r` by the minimum value between `a` and `l - r`. After adjusting `l` and `r`, it updates `a` to be `a` minus the value used for adjustment. Finally, it calculates `max_team_size` as `l + r + a`, ensuring that `max_team_size` is even by subtracting 1 if necessary. The function then prints the final value of `max_team_size`.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `l == r`, the adjustments to `l` and `r` do not occur, and `a` remains unchanged.
- If `a == 0`, no adjustments to `l` or `r` will happen, and `a` remains 0.
- If `l` and `r` are already adjusted to satisfy `l >= r` before entering the function, no changes are made during the function execution.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `l` and `r` are negative, although the problem statement specifies that they should be non-negative integers. This could be an edge case that needs to be considered, although the current code does not enforce this.
