The code `l, r, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `l`, `r`, and `a`. Since the input values replace the original values of `l`, `r`, and `a`, the initial state values of these variables are no longer valid in the output state.

Therefore, the output state is determined solely by the input provided. The variables `l`, `r`, and `a` are now assigned the values of the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, and `a` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user**
