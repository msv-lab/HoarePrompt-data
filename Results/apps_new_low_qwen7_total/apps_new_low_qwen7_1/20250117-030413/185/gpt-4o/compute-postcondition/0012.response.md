The code prints the value of `max_team_size`. The value of `max_team_size` is either the original value of `l + r + a` if it is even, or the original value minus 1 if it is odd. The print statement does not change the value of `max_team_size`, but it outputs its value. Therefore, the only affected variable is `max_team_size`, which remains unchanged in terms of its value, but its value is printed.

Output State: **`max_team_size` is either `l + r + a` if it is even, or `(l + r + a) - 1` if it is odd. The value of `max_team_size` is printed.**
