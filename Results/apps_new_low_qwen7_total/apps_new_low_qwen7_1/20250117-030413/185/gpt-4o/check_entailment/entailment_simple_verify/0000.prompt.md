You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

- Program: 
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and a are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l, r, a <= 100.
def func():
    l, r, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (l < r) :
        l += min(a, r - l)

a -= min(a, r - l)
    else :
        if (r < l) :
            r += min(a, l - r)

a -= min(a, l - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, and `a` are integers where `l` and `r` satisfy the condition `l >= r`. If `r < l`, then `r` is updated to `R + \min(A, L - R)` and `a` is updated to `A - \min(A, L - R)`. Otherwise, no change is made to `r` and `a`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, and `a` are integers. If `l < r`, then `l` is increased by the minimum value between `a` and `r - l`, `a` remains unchanged (since it is less than or equal to 0), and `r` remains the same as the initial value. Otherwise (`r >= l`), `r` is updated to `r + \min(a, l - r)` and `a` is updated to `a - \min(a, l - r)`.
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if (max_team_size % 2 != 0) :
        max_team_size -= 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, `a` are the initial values. `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`. If `max_team_size` is odd, then `max_team_size` is adjusted to be even by subtracting 1 from it. The final value of `max_team_size` will be either the original value minus 1 (if it was odd) or the original value (if it was already even).
    print(max_team_size)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are no ambidexters (`a = 0`). According to the problem description, if there are no ambidexters, the maximum team size will be the minimum between the number of left-handers and right-handers, as ambidexters can play with either hand.

For example, consider the following input:
```
0 2 0
```
- Left-handers (`l`) = 0
- Right-handers (`r`) = 2
- Ambidexters (`a`) = 0

According to the problem description, the maximum team size should be `0` because there are no left-handers to pair with the right-handers. However, the current implementation calculates the maximum team size as follows:
```
max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
```
Since `a = 0`, the calculation becomes:
```
max_team_size = 0 + 2 + 0 // 2 * 2 = 2
```
This results in an incorrect output of `2` instead of `0`.

To fix this, the condition where `a = 0` should directly return the minimum of `l` and `r`. Here is the corrected code snippet:

```python
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0:
        max_team_size = min(l, r)
    else:
        if l < r:
            l += min(a, r - l)
            a -= min(a, r - l)
        elif r < l:
            r += min(a, l - r)
            a -= min(a, l - r)
        max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle cases where there are no ambidexters.
