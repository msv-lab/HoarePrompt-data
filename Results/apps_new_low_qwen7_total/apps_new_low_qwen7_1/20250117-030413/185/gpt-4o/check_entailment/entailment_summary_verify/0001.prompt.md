You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

- Program:
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, it increases `l` by the minimum value between `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, it increases `r` by the minimum value between `a` and `l - r`. After adjusting `l` and `r`, it updates `a` to be `a` minus the value used for adjustment. Finally, it calculates `max_team_size` as `l + r + a`, ensuring that `max_team_size` is even by subtracting 1 if necessary. The function then prints the final value of `max_team_size`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the logic and compare it to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `a` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Balancing Left-Handers and Right-Handers**:
   - If there are fewer left-handers than right-handers (`l < r`), the program attempts to balance the counts by converting some ambidexters to left-handers.
   - If there are fewer right-handers than left-handers (`r < l`), the program attempts to balance the counts by converting some ambidexters to right-handers.
   
3. **Calculating Maximum Team Size**:
   - The program calculates the potential maximum team size by adding the number of left-handers and right-handers and then adding the maximum number of ambidexters that can be used to maintain an even split between left and right handers.
   - Specifically, `max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2` ensures that the total team size is maximized while maintaining an even split.
   - If the resulting team size is odd, it reduces the team size by 1 to ensure it remains even.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated maximum team size.

Now, let's verify this against the examples provided:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: 1 left-hander + 2 converted ambidexters (left-handers) + 3 right-handers = 6. This is correct.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5 5 5`
  - Output: `14`
  - Explanation: All 5 left-handers + all 5 right-handers + 4 more ambidexters (2 each for left and right) = 14. This is correct.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `0 2 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No left-handers, 2 right-handers, and no ambidexters means no one can form a team. This is correct.

Given the logic and examples, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and follows the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
