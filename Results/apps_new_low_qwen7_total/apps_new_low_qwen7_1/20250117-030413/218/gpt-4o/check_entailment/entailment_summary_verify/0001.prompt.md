You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A bus moves along the coordinate line Ox from the point x = 0 to the point x = a. After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a, immediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to the point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.

The petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.

There is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain b liters of gasoline.

What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point x = f to make k journeys? The first journey starts in the point x = 0.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to make k journeys, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9 2 4

Output
4

Input
6 10 2 4

Output
2

Input
6 5 4 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey.

In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. 

In the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling.

- Program:
def func():
    (a, b, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
    refuels = 0
    fuel = b
    total_distance = 2 * a * k
    current_position = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            distance_to_travel = a
            distance_to_fuel_station = f
            distance_after_fuel_station = a - f
        else:
            distance_to_travel = a
            distance_to_fuel_station = a - f
            distance_after_fuel_station = f
        if fuel < distance_to_fuel_station:
            print(-1)
            exit()
        fuel -= distance_to_fuel_station
        if fuel < distance_after_fuel_station:
            refuels += 1
            fuel = b
        fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station
        current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)
    print(refuels)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes no explicit parameters but reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(f\), and \(k\) from standard input, where \(0 < f < a \leq 10^6\), \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\). It simulates a vehicle traveling back and forth along a circular path of length \(2a\), starting with an initial fuel tank capacity of \(b\). For each iteration up to \(k\), the vehicle travels a distance \(a\) towards a fuel station located at a distance \(f\) from its current position, then refuels if necessary and continues its journey. If the vehicle cannot reach the fuel station without refueling, the function prints \(-1\) and exits immediately. After completing all iterations, the function prints the number of times the vehicle refueled. The final state of the program includes the number of refuels, the remaining fuel, and the current position of the vehicle on the circular path.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of refuels required for the bus to complete `k` journeys.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` from the input. These represent the endpoint of the first journey (`a`), the capacity of the fuel tank (`b`), the location of the gas station (`f`), and the number of journeys to be made (`k`).

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `refuels` is initialized to 0 to count the number of refuels.
   - `fuel` is set to `b`, representing the initial amount of fuel in the tank.
   - `total_distance` is calculated as `2 * a * k`, which represents the total distance that needs to be traveled for `k` round trips.
   - `current_position` is initialized to 0, representing the starting position of the bus.

3. **Loop Through Journeys**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each of the `k` journeys.
   - For even-indexed journeys (`i % 2 == 0`), the bus travels from `x=0` to `x=a`.
     - `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f` (distance from start to the gas station).
     - `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f` (distance from the gas station to the endpoint).
   - For odd-indexed journeys (`i % 2 != 0`), the bus travels from `x=a` to `x=0`.
     - `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f` (distance from the endpoint to the gas station).
     - `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f` (distance from the gas station to the start).

4. **Fuel Calculation**:
   - If the current fuel is less than the distance to the gas station, the program prints `-1` and exits, indicating that the bus cannot complete the journey.
   - Otherwise, the fuel is reduced by the distance to the gas station.
   - If the remaining fuel is less than the distance after the gas station, a refuel is needed, and the fuel is reset to `b`.
   - The fuel is then reduced by the distance after the gas station.

5. **Update Position**:
   - The current position of the bus is updated based on the journey type (even or odd).

6. **Output**:
   - After completing all `k` journeys, the program prints the total number of refuels required.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The logic for determining when to refuel and updating the fuel level seems correct.
- The handling of even and odd indexed journeys correctly reflects the bus's movement pattern.
- The check for insufficient fuel before each journey ensures the bus can continue.
- The loop iterates exactly `k` times, ensuring all journeys are considered.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of refuels required for the bus to complete `k` journeys.
