### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided annotated program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make \( k \) journeys.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs \( a \), \( b \), \( f \), and \( k \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `refuels` is initialized to 0 to count the number of refuels.
   - `fuel` is initialized to \( b \) (the initial fuel in the tank).
   - `total_distance` is calculated as \( 2 \times a \times k \) which is the total distance the bus needs to travel for \( k \) round trips.
   - `current_position` is set to 0 initially.

3. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates \( k \) times, simulating each journey.
   - For each journey, the program checks the distance to the gas station and the distance after the gas station separately for both directions (forward and backward).
   - If the fuel is insufficient to reach the gas station, the program prints `-1` and exits immediately.
   - If the fuel is insufficient to cover the distance after reaching the gas station, the bus refuels and then continues.
   - The current position of the bus is updated accordingly.

4. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - The distance to the gas station and the distance after the gas station alternate based on whether the journey is forward or backward.
   - The program ensures that the bus can complete each journey by checking fuel levels before each segment of the journey.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of refuels required to complete \( k \) journeys.

Given the logic and calculations, the program seems to correctly handle the conditions and constraints specified in the problem. It accurately checks the fuel levels and ensures that the bus can complete each journey without running out of fuel, or it correctly identifies when it's not possible to complete the journeys due to insufficient fuel.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of refuels needed for the bus to complete \( k \) journeys. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **True**
