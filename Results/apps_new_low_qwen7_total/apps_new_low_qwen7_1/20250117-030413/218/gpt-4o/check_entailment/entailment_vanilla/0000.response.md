### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of refuels required for the bus to complete `k` journeys.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` from the input. These represent the endpoint of the first journey (`a`), the capacity of the fuel tank (`b`), the location of the gas station (`f`), and the number of journeys to be made (`k`).

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `refuels` is initialized to 0 to count the number of refuels.
   - `fuel` is set to `b`, representing the initial amount of fuel in the tank.
   - `total_distance` is calculated as `2 * a * k`, which represents the total distance that needs to be traveled for `k` round trips.
   - `current_position` is initialized to 0, representing the starting position of the bus.

3. **Loop Through Journeys**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each of the `k` journeys.
   - For even-indexed journeys (`i % 2 == 0`), the bus travels from `x=0` to `x=a`.
     - `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f` (distance from start to the gas station).
     - `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f` (distance from the gas station to the endpoint).
   - For odd-indexed journeys (`i % 2 != 0`), the bus travels from `x=a` to `x=0`.
     - `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f` (distance from the endpoint to the gas station).
     - `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f` (distance from the gas station to the start).

4. **Fuel Calculation**:
   - If the current fuel is less than the distance to the gas station, the program prints `-1` and exits, indicating that the bus cannot complete the journey.
   - Otherwise, the fuel is reduced by the distance to the gas station.
   - If the remaining fuel is less than the distance after the gas station, a refuel is needed, and the fuel is reset to `b`.
   - The fuel is then reduced by the distance after the gas station.

5. **Update Position**:
   - The current position of the bus is updated based on the journey type (even or odd).

6. **Output**:
   - After completing all `k` journeys, the program prints the total number of refuels required.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The logic for determining when to refuel and updating the fuel level seems correct.
- The handling of even and odd indexed journeys correctly reflects the bus's movement pattern.
- The check for insufficient fuel before each journey ensures the bus can continue.
- The loop iterates exactly `k` times, ensuring all journeys are considered.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of refuels required for the bus to complete `k` journeys.

**Correctness: True**
