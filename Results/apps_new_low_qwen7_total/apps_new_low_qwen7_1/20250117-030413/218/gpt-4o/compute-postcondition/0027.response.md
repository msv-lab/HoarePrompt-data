Output State: **i is 2, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line calculates the value of `a - f` and assigns it to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line assigns the value of `f` to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

Note that the initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the values of `a` and `f` are referenced but not defined or updated within this code block. Therefore, they are left as placeholders in the final state.
