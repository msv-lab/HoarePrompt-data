Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is at least 1
- `distance_to_travel` is `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling
- `refuels` is incremented by 1
- `fuel` is `b`

And the code block:
```python
fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station
current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)
```

Let's break down the effects of each line:

1. `fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station`: This line subtracts the `distance_after_fuel_station` from `fuel`. After this operation, `fuel` will be `b - distance_after_fuel_station`.

2. `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)`: This line updates `current_position` based on the current position plus the `distance_to_travel`, and then takes modulo `2 * a` to ensure it stays within the range `[0, 2 * a)`. The `current_position` is updated accordingly.

Since the exact values of `distance_to_travel`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `current_position`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

Final state:
- `i` remains 1
- `k` remains at least 1
- `distance_to_travel` remains `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` remains either `f` or `a - f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` remains the complementary distance after refueling
- `refuels` remains incremented by 1
- `fuel` is now `b - distance_after_fuel_station`
- `current_position` is updated to `(current_position + a) % (2 * a)`

Output State: **i is 1, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is the complementary distance after refueling, refuels is incremented by 1, fuel is b - distance_after_fuel_station, current_position is (current_position + a) % (2 * a)**
