Output State: **i is 1, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**

Explanation:
- The first line `distance_to_travel = a` assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line `distance_to_fuel_station = a - f` calculates the difference between `a` and `f`, assigning the result to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line `distance_after_fuel_station = f` assigns the value of `f` to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not used or modified in the code block. The variables `a` and `f` are referenced but their values are not provided, so they remain as symbols in the output state.
