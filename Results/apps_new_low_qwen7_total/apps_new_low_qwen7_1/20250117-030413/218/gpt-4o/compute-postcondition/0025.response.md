Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is at least 1.
   - `distance_to_travel` is `a`.
   - `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`.
   - `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling.
   - `refuels` is incremented by 1.
   - `fuel` is `b - distance_after_fuel_station`.
   - `current_position` is `(current_position + a) % (2 * a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts at 1 and will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so it will become 2.
   - Since `k` is at least 1, it remains unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise, but since no further information is given about `k`, we assume it remains at least 1.
   - The other variables (`distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `refuels`, `fuel`, and `current_position`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `k`.

5. **New state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `k` is still at least 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1**
