Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling, `refuels` is incremented by 1, and `fuel` is `b`. If the fuel is less than the distance after refueling, the distance to travel remains unchanged; otherwise, the distance to travel is adjusted according to the remaining fuel.***
