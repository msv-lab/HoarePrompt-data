The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints where `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 0 < `f` < `a` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^4. However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, the function itself does not directly use these constraints to produce an output.

Given the output cases are not specified, the function's behavior based on the provided information is not clear. Assuming the function should validate the input constraints, the functionality would be:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but validates that `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` meet the constraints 0 < `f` < `a` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^4.**
