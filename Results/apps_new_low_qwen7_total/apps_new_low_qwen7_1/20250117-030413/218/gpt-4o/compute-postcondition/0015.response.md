The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `k` must remain at least 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1**
