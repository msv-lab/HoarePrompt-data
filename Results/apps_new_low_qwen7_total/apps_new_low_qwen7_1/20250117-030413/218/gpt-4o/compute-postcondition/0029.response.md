Output State: **i is 2, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given as `i` is 2 and `k` is at least 1.
- The values of `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are defined based on the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
- The first line `print(-1)` prints -1 to the console.
- The second line `exit()` terminates the program immediately after printing -1.
- Since the program exits after printing -1, no further modifications to the variables occur.
- Therefore, the final state remains as the initial state with the additional print statement's output.

Note: Although the program prints -1 and exits, this information is not included in the output state as per the instruction to focus on the variables' values.
