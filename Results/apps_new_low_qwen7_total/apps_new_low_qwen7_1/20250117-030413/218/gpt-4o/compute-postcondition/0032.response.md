The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is 2
- `k` is at least 1 (the exact value is not specified, so it remains unspecified)
- `distance_to_travel` is `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`
- `fuel` is now `fuel - f`, which could be 0 or a negative value

The code snippet executes the following operations:
1. `refuels += 1`: This increments the `refuels` variable by 1.
2. `fuel = b`: This assigns the value of `b` to `fuel`.

Since the exact value of `b` is not specified, we'll keep it as `b` in the output state. The variable `refuels` is incremented by 1, and `fuel` is set to `b`.

Output State: **i is 2, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f, refuels is 1, fuel is b**
