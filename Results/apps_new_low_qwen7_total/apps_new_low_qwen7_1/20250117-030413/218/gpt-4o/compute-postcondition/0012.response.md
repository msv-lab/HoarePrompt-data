Output State: **refuels is 1, fuel is b, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f, k is at least 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `refuels += 1` increments the value of `refuels` by 1. Since `refuels` was initially 0, it becomes 1.
- The second line `fuel = b` sets the value of `fuel` to `b`. The original value of `fuel` (which is less than `distance_after_fuel_station`) is now replaced by `b`.
- All other variables (`distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
- The condition that `k` is at least 1 remains true.
