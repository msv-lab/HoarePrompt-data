The code `fuel -= distance_to_fuel_station` decreases the value of `fuel` by `distance_to_fuel_station`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is 1
- `k` is at least 1
- `distance_to_travel` is `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling
- If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues.

Since `fuel -= distance_to_fuel_station` will only execute if `fuel >= distance_to_fuel_station`, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`. The values of `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` also remain unchanged as no code affects them directly.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling, `fuel` is `fuel - distance_to_fuel_station`**
