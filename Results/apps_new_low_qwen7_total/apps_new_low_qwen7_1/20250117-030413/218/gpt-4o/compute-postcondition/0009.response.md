Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 and `k` is at least 1. If `fuel` is less than `distance_to_fuel_station` and `i % 2 == 0`, then `distance_to_fuel_station` remains `f` and `distance_after_fuel_station` remains `a - f`. If `fuel` is less than `distance_to_fuel_station` and `i % 2 != 0`, then `distance_to_fuel_station` remains `a - f` and `distance_after_fuel_station` remains `f`.***
