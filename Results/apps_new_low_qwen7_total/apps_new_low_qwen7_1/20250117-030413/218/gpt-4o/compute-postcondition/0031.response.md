The value of `fuel` is decreased by `distance_to_fuel_station`. Given that `fuel` is initially less than `distance_to_fuel_station`, this subtraction will make `fuel` zero or a negative value. The values of `i`, `k`, `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain unchanged as per the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`, and `fuel` is now `fuel - distance_to_fuel_station` which could be 0 or a negative value.**
