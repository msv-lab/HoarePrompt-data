Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling. If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues without any specified changes to the variables' values.***
