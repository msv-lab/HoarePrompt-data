Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `k` is at least 1. If `fuel` is less than `distance_to_fuel_station`, then `distance_to_travel` remains `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` remains `f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remains `a - f`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`.***
