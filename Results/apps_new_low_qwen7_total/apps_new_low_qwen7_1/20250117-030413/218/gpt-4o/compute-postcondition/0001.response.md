To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `a` is an integer (initial state not specified)
   - `b` is an integer (initial state not specified)
   - `f` is an integer (initial state not specified)
   - `k` is an integer (initial state not specified)
   - `refuels` is 0 (initial state given)
   - `fuel` is an integer and is equal to `b` (initial state given)
   - `total_distance` is \(2 \times a \times k\) (initial state given)
   - `current_position` is 0 (initial state given)

2. **For Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The `range(k)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to \(k-1\). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 initially, and the condition `i < k` must be true.

4. **Variables Involved in the Loop Condition:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

5. **Initial Values Required for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute the first time if `i` is 0.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < k`, so `k` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above analysis, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time should be:

- `i` must be 0.
- `k` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be at least 1**
