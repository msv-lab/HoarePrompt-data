Output State: **i is 0, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line calculates `distance_to_fuel_station` as `a - f`.
- The third line sets `distance_after_fuel_station` to `f`.

No other variables were affected, and the precondition that `i` is 0 and `k` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
