Output State: **i is 1, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line assigns the value of `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line calculates the value of `a - f` and assigns it to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

No other variables are affected by the provided code block. The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
