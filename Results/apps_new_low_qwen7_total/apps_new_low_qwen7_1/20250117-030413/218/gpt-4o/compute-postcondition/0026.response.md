Output State: **i is 2, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The first line `distance_to_travel = a` assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state or within the code block, it remains as `a`.
- The second line `distance_to_fuel_station = f` assigns the value of `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`. Similarly, since `f` is not defined in the initial state or within the code block, it remains as `f`.
- The third line `distance_after_fuel_station = a - f` calculates the difference between `a` and `f` and assigns it to `distance_after_fuel_station`. Since `a` and `f` are not defined in the initial state or within the code block, they remain as `a` and `f` respectively.

No other variables are affected by the code block. Therefore, the final state includes the unchanged variables `i` and `k`, along with the newly defined variables `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` with their respective values as described.
