The given code block consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)`
2. `exit()`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the variables and the overall state:

- The first line `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console.
- The second line `exit()` immediately terminates the program execution without allowing any further code to run.

Since the program terminates right after printing `-1`, no variables are updated or remain affected by subsequent lines of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `fuel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **i is 0, k is at least 1, fuel is less than distance_to_fuel_station, if i % 2 == 0, then distance_to_fuel_station is f and distance_after_fuel_station is a - f, otherwise distance_to_fuel_station is a - f and distance_after_fuel_station is f**
