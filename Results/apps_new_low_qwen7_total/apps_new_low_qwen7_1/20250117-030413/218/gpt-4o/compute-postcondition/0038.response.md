Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters but reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(f\), and \(k\) from standard input, where \(0 < f < a \leq 10^6\), \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\). It simulates a vehicle traveling back and forth along a circular path of length \(2a\), starting with an initial fuel tank capacity of \(b\). For each iteration up to \(k\), the vehicle travels a distance \(a\) towards a fuel station located at a distance \(f\) from its current position, then refuels if necessary and continues its journey. If the vehicle cannot reach the fuel station without refueling, the function prints \(-1\) and exits immediately. After completing all iterations, the function prints the number of times the vehicle refueled. The final state of the program includes the number of refuels, the remaining fuel, and the current position of the vehicle on the circular path.**

This summary covers the actual actions performed by the code, including handling potential edge cases such as the vehicle running out of fuel before reaching a fuel station, which would cause the function to print \(-1\) and terminate.
