Output State: **i is 1, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is the complementary distance after refueling**

Explanation: The provided code block contains two lines. The first line prints `-1` and the second line uses the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further code is executed, and the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the initial states of `i`, `k`, `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are preserved.
