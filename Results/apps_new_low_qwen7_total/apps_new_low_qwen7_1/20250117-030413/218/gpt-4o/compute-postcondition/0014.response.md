Output State: **i is 0, k is at least 1, fuel is either b (if b < distance_after_fuel_station) or the original value of fuel minus distance_to_fuel_station (if b >= distance_after_fuel_station), current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)**

Explanation:
- The first line `fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station` updates the value of `fuel` based on whether it is greater than or equal to `distance_after_fuel_station`. If `fuel >= distance_after_fuel_station`, `fuel` is reduced by `distance_after_fuel_station`. Otherwise, `fuel` remains unchanged and is still `b`.
- The second line `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)` updates the value of `current_position` based on the modulo operation. This line calculates the new position after traveling `distance_to_travel` units, wrapping around if the position exceeds `2 * a`.

Since `i` and `k` are not affected by the given code block, their values remain the same as the initial state. The updated `fuel` value is dependent on the condition and the initial value of `fuel` and `distance_after_fuel_station`. The `current_position` is updated based on the travel distance and wraps around the total distance `2 * a`.
