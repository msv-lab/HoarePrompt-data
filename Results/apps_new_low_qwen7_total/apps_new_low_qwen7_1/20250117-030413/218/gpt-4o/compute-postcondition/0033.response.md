Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`. If `fuel` is less than `distance_after_fuel_station`, the function refuels once, setting `refuels` to 1 and adjusting `fuel` accordingly (which could be 0 or a negative value). If `fuel` is not less than `distance_after_fuel_station`, no changes occur to `refuels` and `fuel` remains as `fuel - distance_to_fuel_station`.**
