Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling.***

This postcondition covers both cases of the if-else statement:
- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`.
- Otherwise, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`.
