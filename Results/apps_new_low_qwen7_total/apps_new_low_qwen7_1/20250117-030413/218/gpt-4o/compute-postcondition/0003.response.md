Output State: **i is 0, k must be at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `i` being 0 and `k` being at least 1.
- The first line `distance_to_travel = a` assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line `distance_to_fuel_station = f` assigns the value of `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line `distance_after_fuel_station = a - f` assigns the value of `a - f` to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The condition that `i` modulo 2 is 0 remains true since no operations were performed on `i`. The value of `k` being at least 1 is also unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all the updated or unchanged variables and the conditions from the precondition.
