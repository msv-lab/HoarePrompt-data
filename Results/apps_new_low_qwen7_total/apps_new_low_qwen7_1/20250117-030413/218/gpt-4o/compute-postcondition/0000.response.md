Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, refuels is 0, fuel is an integer equal to b, total_distance is 2 * a * k, current_position is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line takes input and splits it into four integers, assigning them to `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` respectively.
- The second line initializes `refuels` to 0.
- The third line sets `fuel` to the value of `b`.
- The fourth line calculates `total_distance` as `2 * a * k`.
- The fifth line initializes `current_position` to 0.

Since the input values for `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` are not specified, they remain as given in the initial state, while `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, and `current_position` are initialized as described.
