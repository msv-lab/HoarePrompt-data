The first line `refuels += 1` increments the number of refuels by 1. The second line `fuel = b` sets the value of `fuel` to `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is at least 1 (but not affected by the code)
- `distance_to_travel` is `a`
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is the complementary distance after refueling
- `fuel` is `fuel - distance_to_fuel_station`

After executing the code:
- `refuels` becomes `refuels + 1`
- `fuel` becomes `b`

Since `k` is not affected by the code, it remains unchanged. The values of `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are also not changed by the code.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **i is 1, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is the complementary distance after refueling, refuels is refuels + 1, fuel is b**
