Output State: **i is 2, k is at least 1, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f, fuel is adjusted by subtracting distance_after_fuel_station, current_position is updated to (current_position + distance_to_travel) modulo 2 * a, refuels is 1 if fuel is less than distance_after_fuel_station, otherwise refuels remains unchanged**
