The given code snippet does not directly modify any variables in the initial state. It calculates the angle between two vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]` using the `math.acos` function. However, the variables `v`, `i`, and `j` are not defined in the initial state, and thus their values are not specified. The calculation of the angle is performed using these undefined variables, but no changes are made to `n`, `i`, or `j` themselves.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`, angle is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))**
