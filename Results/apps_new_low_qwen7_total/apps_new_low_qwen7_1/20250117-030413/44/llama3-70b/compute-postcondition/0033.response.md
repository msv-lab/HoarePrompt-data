Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, `ans_angle` is `angle`, `ans` is `i`, `j` is `i + 1`, `angle` is calculated using the formula `(v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] * v[i][0] + v[i][1] * v[i][1])`. If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` is updated to `angle`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
