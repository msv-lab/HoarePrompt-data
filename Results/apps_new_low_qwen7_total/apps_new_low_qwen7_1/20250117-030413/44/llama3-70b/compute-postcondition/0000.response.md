The given code snippet is incomplete and does not contain the logic to process the vectors or store their directions. However, based on the initial state and the provided code block, we can infer the following:

- `n` is set to an integer input, representing the number of vectors.
- An empty list `v` is initialized to store the vectors.

Since no operations are performed on `v` or any other variables within the given code snippet, the only changes made are setting `n` to an integer input and initializing `v` as an empty list. 

Given the precondition, the list `v` should eventually be populated with tuples representing the vectors, but this population is not shown in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the final state after running the given code block will only include the variables `n` and `v` as described above.

Output State: **n is an integer, v is an empty list**
