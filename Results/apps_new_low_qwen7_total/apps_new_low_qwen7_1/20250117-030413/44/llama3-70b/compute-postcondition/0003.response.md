Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The key variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop continuation**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` is `X`
   - `y` is `Y`
   - `v` is `[(X, Y)]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue, and no changes are mentioned for `x`, `y`, or `v`, these variables' values remain the same.
   - The only variable that could change is `n`, but since the problem does not specify a decrement or other modification to `n`, we assume `n` remains the same for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `X`, `y` is `Y`, `v` is `[(X, Y)]`**
