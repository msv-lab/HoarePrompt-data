Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2) * math.sqrt(v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`

Code Block:
```
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

Analysis:
- The first line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`.
- The second line assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `angle`, `i`, and `j` are not provided, we cannot determine their specific numerical values. However, based on the initial conditions and the operations performed, we can state the following:

- `ans_angle` will hold the value of `angle`.
- `ans` will hold the tuple `(i, j)`.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer, i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100), j is in the range (i + 1, min(n, i + 100)), ans_angle is the value of angle, ans is (i, j)**
