Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`
- `ans_angle` is `angle`
- `ans` is `i`
- If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans` remains `i`; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged since there is no update in the else part.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head includes `j`, `i`, and `min(n, i + 100)` as critical for determining if the loop should continue.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Variable `j`**: Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to but does not include `min(n, i + 100)`, it will take on each value in this range sequentially.
- **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` itself does not change within the loop; it is only used to determine the range for `j`.
- **Variable `min(n, i + 100)`**: This value changes based on the current value of `i`. However, for the purpose of determining if the loop can continue, it is derived from `i` and `n`.

### Updated State:
- The loop will continue if `j` is still within the specified range. Therefore, `j` will start from `i + 1` and increment until it reaches `min(n, i + 100)`. If `j` exceeds this range, the loop will terminate.

Given the initial conditions and the loop range:
- `j` will start from `i + 1`
- The loop will continue as long as `j < min(n, i + 100)`

Since `i` and `n` are not directly updated within the loop, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` remains a non-negative integer and less than `min(n, i + 101)`
- `ans_angle` remains `angle`
- `ans` remains `i` (since there is no update in the else part)

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, `ans_angle` is `angle`, `ans` is `i`, and `j` is `i + 1` (the starting value for the next iteration)**
