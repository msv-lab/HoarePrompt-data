Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in this case are `j`, `i`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`. For the loop to start executing, the value of `j` must be within this range.

3. **Initial State Analysis**: We know that `n` must be greater than 0 (from the given state before the loop). However, we don't have an initial value for `i`. Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`.

4. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be in the range `[i + 1, min(n, i + 100)]`.
   - Since `j` is generated starting from `i + 1`, the smallest possible value for `j` is `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `min(n, i + 100)`.

5. **Conditions**:
   - `n > 0` (already known).
   - `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`: This condition ensures that the loop can start because `j` will be set to `i + 1` initially.

6. **Specific Values**:
   - If `i` is very small (let's say `i = 0`), then `i + 1 = 1` and the condition becomes `1 <= min(n, 101)`, which is always true since `n > 0`.
   - If `i` is large, say `i = 99`, then `i + 1 = 100` and the condition becomes `100 <= min(n, 199)`, which again is true as long as `n > 99`.

Given these points, we can summarize the required state as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be such that `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)` and `j` will start from `i + 1`**.

However, to make it more precise and align with the format provided:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be a non-negative integer, and `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `j` being set to `i + 1` initially.
