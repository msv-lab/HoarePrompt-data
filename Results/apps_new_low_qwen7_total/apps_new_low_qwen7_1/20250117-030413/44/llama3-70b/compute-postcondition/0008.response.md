Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, x is any integer, y is any integer, v is a list of tuples sorted by their angle with respect to the origin in counterclockwise order starting from the positive x-axis, ans is a tuple (0, 1), ans_angle is pi**

Explanation:
- The line `ans = 0, 1` initializes `ans` as a tuple `(0, 1)`.
- The line `ans_angle = math.pi` assigns the value of `math.pi` to `ans_angle`.
- The line `v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))` sorts the list `v` based on the angle formed by each tuple `(X, Y)` with respect to the origin. The `math.atan2(Y, X)` function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(X, Y)`, measured counterclockwise. This ensures that the list `v` is sorted in the correct order.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the contents of `v` were not specified, we maintain the general conditions and describe the changes made by the code. The list `v` is now sorted according to the angles, and the variables `ans` and `ans_angle` are initialized to specific values.
