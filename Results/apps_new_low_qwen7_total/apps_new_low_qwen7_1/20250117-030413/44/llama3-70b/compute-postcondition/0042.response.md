Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`, `ans_angle` is updated based on the new calculated angle, `ans` is a tuple containing the updated indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs \((v[i], v[j])\) where \(i < j \leq \text{min}(n, i + 100)\), and the current value of `angle` is less than the current value of `ans_angle`***
