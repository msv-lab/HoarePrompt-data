The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `ans_angle = angle`
2. `ans = i, j`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines on the variables:

- The first line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. This means that `ans_angle` now holds the same value as `angle`.
- The second line assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to `ans`. This means that `ans` is now a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`
- `ans_angle` is `angle`
- `ans` is `i, j`
- `j` is `i + 1`

After executing the code:
- `ans_angle` retains its value, which is `angle`.
- `ans` is updated to be the tuple `(i, j)`, where `j` is `i + 1`.

Since no other variables are affected, the final state is:
Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer and is less than min(n, i + 101), ans_angle is angle, ans is (i, i+1), j is i + 1, angle is calculated using the formula (v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2)**
