Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, and the loop continues to increment `i` until `i + 1 > min(n, i + 100)`. After the loop finishes, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` where `j` is the index such that the angle between `v[i]` and `v[j]` is the smallest found during the loop, and `ans_angle` holds this minimum angle value. If no such pair `(i, j)` exists that satisfies the condition `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans` will still contain the last evaluated pair `(i, j)` and `ans_angle` will hold the largest angle found or the initial value of `ans_angle` if no angles were smaller.**

This state reflects that the loop iterates over possible `j` values starting from `i + 1` up to the minimum of `n` and `i + 100`, calculating the cosine similarity angle between vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`. The smallest angle found is stored in `ans_angle` along with the corresponding indices in `ans`.
