To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information:

- The initial state is: `n` is an integer, and `v` is an empty list.
- The for loop is: `for _ in range(n):`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The loop must have something to iterate over. The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \). For the loop to execute even once, this sequence must contain at least one element. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. The loop variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index is not needed in the loop body. However, the condition for the loop to execute is still dependent on the value of `n`.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `v` (which is the list) does not directly affect whether the loop executes but could be modified within the loop body.

Thus, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
