To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `for` loop will start its first iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
   
2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

4. **Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i < n`.
   - Given `i = 0`, the condition `0 < n` must be true.

5. **Other Variables (`x`, `y`, `v`, `ans`, `ans_angle`):**
   - These variables are not directly involved in determining whether the loop will execute the first time.
   - However, they may influence the loop's behavior during each iteration.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the only necessary condition is that `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` starts at 0, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
