Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which is defined in the range function as `range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`.
   - `i` is the same as before, meaning it hasn't changed from the previous iteration.
   - `j` is initially set to `i + 2`.
   - `angle` is calculated based on the values in the list `v`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < min(n, i + 100)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 2`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` would be `j + 1` or `i + 3`.

5. **Check if the loop condition is met**:
   - The loop will continue if `j < min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `j` was `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` is `i + 3`.
   - We need to ensure that `i + 3` is still less than `min(n, i + 100)`.

6. **State adjustments**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `j` changes to `i + 3`.
   - `angle` is recalculated based on the updated value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]`**
