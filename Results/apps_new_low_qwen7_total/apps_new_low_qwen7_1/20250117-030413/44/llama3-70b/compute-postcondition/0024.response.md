Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues to increment `i` until `i + 1 > min(n, i + 100)`. This means the loop will continue as long as the condition is satisfied.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, and the loop continues to increment `i` until `i + 1 > min(n, i + 100)`.

4. **Analyze the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `min(n, i + 100)`. 

5. **Adjust the States**: If the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

6. **Maintain the Condition**: Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new condition becomes `i + 1 > min(n, (i + 1) + 100)`. Simplifying this, it becomes `i + 2 > min(n, i + 101)`. 

7. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `min(n, i + 101) - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, and the loop continues to increment `i` until `i + 1 > min(n, i + 100)`.**
