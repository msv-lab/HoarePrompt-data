Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))`. If `angle < ans_angle`, the function continues with the condition met. Otherwise, no change is made.***
