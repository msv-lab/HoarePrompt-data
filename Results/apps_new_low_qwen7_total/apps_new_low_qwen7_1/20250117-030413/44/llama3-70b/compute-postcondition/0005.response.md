Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable and `n` as the range limit. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` is `X_new`.
   - `y` is `Y_new`.
   - `v` is `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new)]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the state.
   - `n` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, `n` should be `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1. So, `n` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `x`, `y`, `v` remain unchanged because they are not directly involved in the loop head conditions.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is `X_new`, `y` is `Y_new`, `v` is `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new)]`**.
