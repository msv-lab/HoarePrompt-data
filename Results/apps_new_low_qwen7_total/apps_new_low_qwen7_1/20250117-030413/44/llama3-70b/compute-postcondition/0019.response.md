Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`.
   - `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.
   - If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans` is set to `i, j`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `angle`, and `ans_angle` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` is defined in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `j` is the loop variable, it will be incremented at the end of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

Given that `j` must be incremented and still within the specified range, let's update the states accordingly:

- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `j + 1`.
- The condition `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)` ensures that the new value of `j` is still within the valid range.

Since the loop continues as long as `j` is within the specified range, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` still satisfies this condition. Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))` and `j` is incremented by 1**.

Final State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))` and `j` is incremented by 1**.
