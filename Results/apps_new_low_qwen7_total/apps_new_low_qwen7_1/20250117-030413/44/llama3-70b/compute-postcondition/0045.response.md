Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`.
   - `angle` is the current angle being evaluated.
   - `ans_angle` is the smallest angle found so far.
   - `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j â‰¤ min(n, i + 100)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration**:
   - The variable `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Inside the loop, if `angle` is less than `ans_angle`, `ans_angle` and `ans` are updated. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, starting from `i + 1`.

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1, the condition `j < min(n, i + 100)` must hold true for the next iteration.

6. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `j` will be `i + 1` at the start of the first iteration of the next loop, but for the next state, it should be `i + 2` (since it will increment by 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `j` will be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`, `i` is the same as before, `j` must be `i + 2`**.
