Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`.

### Loop Condition
The loop runs as long as `j` is in the range `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be within the range `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - This means `i + 1` should be less than or equal to `min(n, i + 100)`.

2. **Evaluate the Range Condition:**
   - Since `i` is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, the maximum value of `i` is `min(n, i + 100) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` will always be less than or equal to `min(n, i + 100)` as long as `i` satisfies the condition `i < min(n, i + 101)`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial value of `i` must be such that `i + 1` is within the valid range, which it inherently is based on the given conditions.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start with `j = i + 1`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the loop will execute the first time if `i` is a non-negative integer and `i < min(n, i + 101)`, and `i + 1` is within the valid range for `j`.

### Final State
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, and `i + 1` must be within the range `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)` for the loop to execute the first time.**

This can be simplified to:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)` and `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `min(n, i + 100)`**.

Since `i + 1` is inherently within the range if `i` is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, we can simply state the conditions as:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`**.
