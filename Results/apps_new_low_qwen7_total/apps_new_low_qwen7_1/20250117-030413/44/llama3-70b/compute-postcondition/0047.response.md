Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's analyze the execution step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`
- `i` is the same as before (so it is `min(n, 100) + 1`)
- `j` must be `i + 2`
- `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))`

### Code Snippet:
```python
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `ans_angle = angle`**
   - This line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. Therefore, `ans_angle` now holds the same value as `angle`.

2. **Line 2: `ans = i, j`**
   - This line creates a tuple `ans` containing the values of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` and `j` were previously defined as `i = min(n, 100) + 1` and `j = i + 2`, respectively, these values remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`.
- `i` is still `min(n, 100) + 1`.
- `j` is still `i + 2`.
- `angle` retains its computed value from the previous calculation.
- `ans_angle` is assigned the value of `angle`.
- `ans` is the tuple `(i, j)`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least i = min(n, 100) + 1, i is min(n, 100) + 1, j is i + 2, angle is calculated as math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2)), ans_angle is the same as angle, ans is (i, j)**
