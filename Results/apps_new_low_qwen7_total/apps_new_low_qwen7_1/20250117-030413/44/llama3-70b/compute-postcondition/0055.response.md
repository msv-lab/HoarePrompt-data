The code `print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)` simply prints the values of `ans[0]` and `ans[1]` each incremented by 1. The values of `ans[0]` and `ans[1]` are the indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)` and `i` ranges up to `min(n, 100)`. The print statement does not change the values of any variables, so the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `ans_angle`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` equals `min(n, 100)`, `j` equals `min(n, i + 99)`, `ans_angle` is the minimum value of all angles calculated during the loop, and `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)` and `i` ranges up to `min(n, 100)`.**
