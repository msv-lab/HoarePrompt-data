Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 \leq \min(n, i + 100)`, `j` is in the range `(i + 1, \min(n, i + 100))`, and `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / \sqrt{v[i][0]^2 + v[i][1]^2} * \sqrt{v[j][0]^2 + v[j][1]^2})`. If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is updated to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `ans_angle` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
