The initial state is defined as follows: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is `X_new`, `y` is `Y_new`, and `v` is `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new)]`.

The code block provided reads:
```python
x, y = map(int, input().split())
v.append((x, y))
```

This code does the following:
1. It takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `y`.
2. It appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`.

Let's break it down step by step:
- The first line takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. For example, if the input is "5 7", then `x` becomes 5 and `y` becomes 7.
- The second line appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`. So, `v` would become `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new), (5, 7)]`.

Since the exact input is not specified, let's denote the input as `a` and `b` for generality. Therefore, the final state after running the code will be:
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `x` becomes the first integer from the input.
- `y` becomes the second integer from the input.
- `v` becomes `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new), (a, b)]`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, x is a, y is b, v is [(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new), (a, b)]**
