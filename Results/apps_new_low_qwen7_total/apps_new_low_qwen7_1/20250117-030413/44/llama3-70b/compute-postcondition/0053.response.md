Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`. `ans_angle` is the minimum angle calculated among all valid pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)`, and `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield this smallest angle. The loop continues to execute until no further smaller angles can be found or until `j` exceeds `min(n, i + 100)`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - `i` starts at `min(n, 100) + 1`.
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - For each pair `(v[i], v[j])`, the angle between the vectors is calculated using the dot product and the magnitudes of the vectors.
   - If the calculated angle is smaller than the current `ans_angle`, `ans_angle` and `ans` are updated.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**:
     - `i` remains constant as it is initialized and does not change within the loop.
   - **Variables that Change**:
     - `j` increments in each iteration from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
     - `angle` is recalculated in each iteration but only `ans_angle` and `ans` are updated if `angle < ans_angle`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to execute as long as `j` does not exceed `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - After each iteration, if a smaller angle is found, `ans_angle` and `ans` are updated to reflect this new smallest angle and its corresponding vector indices.
   - Once `j` reaches `min(n, i + 100)`, the loop terminates.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop ensures that all possible pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)` are checked.
   - `ans_angle` and `ans` are guaranteed to contain the smallest angle and its corresponding indices after all iterations.

Thus, the final output state captures the essence of the loop's behavior and the resulting values of `ans_angle` and `ans` after all iterations.
