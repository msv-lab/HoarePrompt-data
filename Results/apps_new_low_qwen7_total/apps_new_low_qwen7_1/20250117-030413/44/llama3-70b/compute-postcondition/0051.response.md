Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's analyze the impact of each line on the program:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `ans_angle = angle`**
   - This line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. Therefore, `ans_angle` now holds the same value as `angle`.

2. **Line 2: `ans = i, j`**
   - This line assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to `ans`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `ans` now contains the pair `(i, j)`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `angle` remains unchanged (as it was calculated earlier).
- `ans_angle` is now equal to `angle`.
- `ans` is now the tuple `(i, j)`.

### Output State:
Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least i = min(n, 100) + 1, i is unchanged, j is unchanged, angle is unchanged, ans_angle is equal to angle, ans is a tuple (i, j)**
