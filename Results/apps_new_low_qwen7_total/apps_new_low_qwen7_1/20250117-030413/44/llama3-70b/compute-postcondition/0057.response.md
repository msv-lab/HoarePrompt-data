Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. It sorts these vectors in counterclockwise order around the origin. Then, it finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them, considering only the first 100 vectors or all vectors if there are fewer than 100. Finally, it prints the 1-based indices of these two vectors.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input list has fewer than 100 vectors, the function still considers all vectors when finding the pair with the smallest angle.
- The function assumes that no two vectors have the same direction but can handle vectors with opposite directions correctly since it uses the `atan2` function, which distinguishes between directions.
