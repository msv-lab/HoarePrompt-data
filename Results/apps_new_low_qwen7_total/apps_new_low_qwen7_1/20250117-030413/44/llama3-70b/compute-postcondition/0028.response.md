Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer and is less than min(n, i + 101), ans_angle is angle, ans is i, j**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`, updating the value of `ans_angle` to the current value of `angle`. The second line assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to `ans`, updating the value of `ans` to this tuple. No other variables are affected by the given code block.
