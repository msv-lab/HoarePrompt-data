Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`. If the current value of `angle` is less than the current value of `ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` is updated based on the new calculated angle, and `ans` is a tuple containing the updated indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j â‰¤ min(n, i + 100)`. Otherwise, the values of `ans_angle` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
