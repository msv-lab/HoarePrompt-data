Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`. If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition cannot be determined since there is no else part specified in the code.***

In this case, since there is no else part provided, we can only describe the state when the condition `angle < ans_angle` is true. When this condition is met, the `ans` tuple does not change. Without an else part, we cannot specify what happens if the condition is false.
