The initial state is defined as follows:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is `X`
- `y` is `Y`
- `v` is `[(X, Y)]`

The code block to execute is:
```
x, y = map(int, input().split())
v.append((x, y))
```

Let's break down the effects of these lines:

1. The first line `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts (based on whitespace), converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. After this line, the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the user's input.

2. The second line `v.append((x, y))` appends a tuple containing the new values of `x` and `y` to the list `v`.

Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are `X` and `Y` respectively, after the user inputs new values for `x` and `y`, let's denote the new values as `X_new` and `Y_new` (assuming the user inputs different values).

The final state after executing the code block will be:
- `n` is still greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is now `X_new`
- `y` is now `Y_new`
- `v` is now `[(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new)]`

Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, x is X_new, y is Y_new, v is [(X, Y), (X_new, Y_new)]**
