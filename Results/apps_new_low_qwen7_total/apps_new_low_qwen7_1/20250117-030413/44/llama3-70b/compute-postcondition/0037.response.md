Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is a non-negative integer and is less than `min(n, i + 101)`, `ans_angle` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans_angle` and the angle calculated from the dot product of vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`. The vector `ans` is set to the vector `v[j]`.***

Explanation:
- The if part updates `ans_angle` to the minimum value between the current `ans_angle` and the angle calculated from the dot product of vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`.
- Since there is no else part, the only update to `ans_angle` and `ans` happens within the if condition.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition states that `ans_angle` is updated to the minimum value as described, and `ans` is set to `v[j]`.
