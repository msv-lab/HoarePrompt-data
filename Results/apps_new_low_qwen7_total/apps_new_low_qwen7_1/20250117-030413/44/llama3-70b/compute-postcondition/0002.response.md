The initial state is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. However, the code snippet provided does not assign any value to `n`, so `n` remains as per the precondition.

The code snippet consists of two lines:
1. `x, y = map(int, input().split())`: This line takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `x` and `y` respectively.
2. `v.append((x, y))`: This line appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to a list `v`.

Since no specific values are given for `x` and `y`, we can represent them as generic integers `X` and `Y`. After executing the code, the list `v` will contain one tuple `(X, Y)`.

Given this analysis, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, x is X, y is Y, v is [(X, Y)]**
