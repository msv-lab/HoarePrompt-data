Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer, i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100), j is in the range (i + 1, min(n, i + 100)), ans_angle is the arccosine of the dot product of v[i] and v[j] divided by the product of their magnitudes, ans is i, j**

Explanation:
- The first line `ans_angle = angle` assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. The value of `angle` is defined as the arccosine of the dot product of `v[i]` and `v[j]` divided by the product of their magnitudes. This value is stored in `ans_angle`.
- The second line `ans = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `ans`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged; they are just part of a tuple assigned to `ans`.

Since the code does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, or `v`, these variables retain their initial conditions. The values of `ans_angle` and `ans` are introduced due to the execution of the given lines.
