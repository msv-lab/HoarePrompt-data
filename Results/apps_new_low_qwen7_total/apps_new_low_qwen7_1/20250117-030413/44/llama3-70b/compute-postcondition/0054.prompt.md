Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 0, x is any integer, y is any integer, v is a list of tuples sorted by their angle with respect to the origin in counterclockwise order starting from the positive x-axis, ans is a tuple (0, 1), ans_angle is pi
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
        angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.
            sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[
            j][1] ** 2))
        if angle < ans_angle:
            ans_angle = angle
            ans = i, j


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, and the loop continues to increment `i` until `i + 1 > min(n, i + 100)`. After the loop finishes, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` where `j` is the index such that the angle between `v[i]` and `v[j]` is the smallest found during the loop, and `ans_angle` holds this minimum angle value. If no such pair `(i, j)` exists that satisfies the condition `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans` will still contain the last evaluated pair `(i, j)` and `ans_angle` will hold the largest angle found or the initial value of `ans_angle` if no angles were smaller.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer, `i` equals `min(n, 100)`, `ans_angle` is the minimum value of all angles calculated during the loop, and `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)` and `i` ranges up to `min(n, 100)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer and at least `i = min(n, 100) + 1`. `ans_angle` is the minimum angle calculated among all valid pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)`, and `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield this smallest angle. The loop continues to execute until no further smaller angles can be found or until `j` exceeds `min(n, i + 100)`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
