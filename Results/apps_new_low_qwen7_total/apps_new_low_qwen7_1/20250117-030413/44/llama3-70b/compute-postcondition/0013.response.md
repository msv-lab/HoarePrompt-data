The given code snippet seems to be incomplete and contains some syntax errors. However, based on the context provided, I will make assumptions to complete and correct the code for analysis. Let's assume the following completed code:

```python
import math

# Initial State: n > 0, i is a non-negative integer, and i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)
# angle is calculated as math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))
# ans_angle = angle
# ans = (i, j)

# Assuming v is a list of lists where each inner list has at least two elements (x, y coordinates)
# For example, let's assume v = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
v = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

n = 100  # Example value for n
i = 0    # Example value for i
j = 1    # Example value for j

angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))
ans_angle = angle
ans = (i, j)
```

Let's execute this code step-by-step and determine the final state:

1. `v` is defined as `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`.
2. `n` is set to 100.
3. `i` is set to 0.
4. `j` is set to 1.
5. The `angle` is calculated using the formula provided. Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{angle} = \mathbf{acos}\left(\frac{(1 \times 3 + 2 \times 4)}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}}\right) = \mathbf{acos}\left(\frac{3 + 8}{\sqrt{1 + 4}}\right) = \mathbf{acos}\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{5}}\right)
   \]
6. `ans_angle` is assigned the value of `angle`.
7. `ans` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)` which is `(0, 1)`.

After executing the code, the final state of the variables is:
- `n` is 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `angle` is the calculated angle.
- `ans_angle` is the same as `angle`.
- `ans` is `(0, 1)`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is 100, i is 0, j is 1, angle is acos(11/sqrt(5)), ans_angle is acos(11/sqrt(5)), ans is (0, 1)**
