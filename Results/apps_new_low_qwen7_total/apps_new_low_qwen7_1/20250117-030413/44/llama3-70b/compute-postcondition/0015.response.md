Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`.
- The loop variable `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to but does not include `min(n, i + 100)`.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Key Variables in the Loop Head
- `j`: This is the loop variable that changes with each iteration.
- `i`: This is a variable that remains unchanged within the loop.
- `n`: This is a variable that remains unchanged within the loop.

### Adjusting the States
At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been set to some value within the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `j` should still be within the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

Since `i` and `n` remain unchanged, they retain their values from the previous iteration. 

### Updated State
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `i` is still a non-negative integer.
- `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)` (unchanged).
- The new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1, and it must still be within the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.

### Final State
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, and `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1, such that `j` is still within the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.**

To represent this precisely:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1 <= min(n, i + 100)`, and `j` is in the range `(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`.**
