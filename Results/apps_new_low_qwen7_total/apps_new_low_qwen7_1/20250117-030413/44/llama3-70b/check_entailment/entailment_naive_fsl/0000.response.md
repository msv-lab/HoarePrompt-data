Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle using a brute-force approach within a limited range. However, this approach has several issues:

1. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which orders them based on their polar angles. This is generally correct for finding the minimum angle between pairs.

2. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between vectors using `math.acos` which is correct for calculating the angle between two vectors. However, this calculation assumes normalized vectors, and the formula used is:
   \[
   \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i||\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{v}_i\) and \(\mathbf{v}_j\) are the vectors. This is valid, but the program limits the range of \(j\) to \(i + 100\), which may not cover all possible pairs of vectors efficiently.

3. **Limiting the Range**: The inner loop is limited to \(i + 100\). This is problematic because it might miss some pairs of vectors with a smaller angle if the number of vectors is large. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   5
   1 0
   0 1
   -1 0
   0 -1
   1 1
   ```

   In this case, the minimal non-oriented angle is between \((1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\), which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). The program will not consider the pair \((1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\) because it only checks up to \(i + 100\), and \(i + 100\) exceeds the length of the list.

To fix this, the inner loop should iterate over the entire list of vectors without any limit. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible pairs of vectors are considered, thereby addressing the issue with the original program.
