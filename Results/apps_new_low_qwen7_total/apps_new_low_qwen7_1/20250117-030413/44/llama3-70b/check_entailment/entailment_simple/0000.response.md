Reasoning:
1. **Sorting Vectors**: The program sorts the vectors using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`. This ensures that the vectors are sorted in a counterclockwise order around the origin, which is crucial for calculating the minimal non-oriented angle between any two vectors.
2. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between every pair of consecutive vectors within a sliding window of size 100. This approach is efficient because it limits the number of comparisons to a manageable amount (up to 100 comparisons per vector).
3. **Minimal Angle Tracking**: The program keeps track of the minimal angle found (`ans_angle`) and updates the indices of the vectors (`ans`) accordingly. This ensures that the final result is the pair of vectors with the smallest non-oriented angle.
4. **Output**: The program prints the indices of the vectors with the smallest non-oriented angle, adjusted by adding 1 to account for 1-based indexing in the output.

Given the constraints and the logic used in the program, it correctly finds the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

Correctness: **True**
