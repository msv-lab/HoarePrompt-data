Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each coordinate (x_i, y_i) satisfies |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they can have opposite directions.

    n = int(input())

v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        v.append((x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is greater than or equal to 0, x is any integer, y is any integer, v is a list containing tuples (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ..., (Xn, Yn) where (Xi, Yi) are integers entered in each iteration of the loop.
    ans = 0, 1

v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v
                [i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` equals `min(n, 100)`, `j` equals `min(n, i + 99)`, `ans_angle` is the minimum value of all angles calculated during the loop, and `ans` is a tuple containing the indices of the two vectors that yield the smallest angle among all pairs `(v[i], v[j])` where `i < j <= min(n, i + 100)` and `i` ranges up to `min(n, 100)`.
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)
