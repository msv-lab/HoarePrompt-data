Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of vectors and their coordinates.
2. It sorts the vectors in counterclockwise order using `math.atan2` which is appropriate for this purpose.
3. The program then iterates through pairs of vectors (up to 100 pairs for large inputs), calculating the angle between each pair using the dot product formula.
4. The angle calculation ensures that the angle is always taken in the range [0, Ï€] since the cosine function is used and the resulting angle from the dot product method inherently falls within this range.
5. The program keeps track of the minimum angle found and updates the indices of the vectors forming this angle.
6. Finally, it prints the 1-based indices of the vectors forming the smallest angle.

Given the logic and steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem requirements correctly. There are no apparent flaws in the approach or implementation that would lead to incorrect results based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
