You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each coordinate (x_i, y_i) satisfies |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they can have opposite directions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. It sorts the vectors by their angle with respect to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2()`, which returns the angle in radians.
3. It then calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors (and also up to 100 vectors ahead due to the loop condition) and keeps track of the smallest angle found and the corresponding vector indices.
4. The cosine formula used to calculate the angle between two vectors is correct:
   \[
   \text{angle} = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{\|\mathbf{v}_i\| \|\mathbf{v}_j\|}\right)
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of vectors \(\mathbf{v}_i\) and \(\mathbf{v}_j\), and \(\|\mathbf{v}_i\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{v}_j\|\) are their magnitudes.
5. The program correctly outputs the indices of the vectors with the smallest angle.

However, there is an issue with the way pairs are being considered. The loop only considers vectors within a fixed distance (100 vectors ahead) of the current one, which may not capture the minimum angle if the smallest angle is between a vector far apart in the sorted list. This could potentially miss the true minimal angle.

To address this, the program should ideally consider all pairs of vectors, not just those within a limited range.

Given these considerations, the provided program might not always yield the correct result due to its limited scope in pair consideration.
