You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

- Program:
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. It sorts these vectors in counterclockwise order around the origin. Then, it finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them, considering only the first 100 vectors or all vectors if there are fewer than 100. Finally, it prints the 1-based indices of these two vectors.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle using a brute-force approach within a limited range. However, this approach has several issues:

1. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`, which orders them based on their polar angles. This is generally correct for finding the minimum angle between pairs.

2. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between vectors using `math.acos` which is correct for calculating the angle between two vectors. However, this calculation assumes normalized vectors, and the formula used is:
   \[
   \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{|\mathbf{v}_i||\mathbf{v}_j|}\right)
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{v}_i\) and \(\mathbf{v}_j\) are the vectors. This is valid, but the program limits the range of \(j\) to \(i + 100\), which may not cover all possible pairs of vectors efficiently.

3. **Limiting the Range**: The inner loop is limited to \(i + 100\). This is problematic because it might miss some pairs of vectors with a smaller angle if the number of vectors is large. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   5
   1 0
   0 1
   -1 0
   0 -1
   1 1
   ```

   In this case, the minimal non-oriented angle is between \((1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\), which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). The program will not consider the pair \((1, 0)\) and \((0, 1)\) because it only checks up to \(i + 100\), and \(i + 100\) exceeds the length of the list.

To fix this, the inner loop should iterate over the entire list of vectors without any limit. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible pairs of vectors are considered, thereby addressing the issue with the original program.
