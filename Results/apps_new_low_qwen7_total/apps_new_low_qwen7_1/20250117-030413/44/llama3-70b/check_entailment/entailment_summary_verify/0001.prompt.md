You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. It sorts these vectors in counterclockwise order around the origin. Then, it finds the pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them, considering only the first 100 vectors or all vectors if there are fewer than 100. Finally, it prints the 1-based indices of these two vectors.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. It sorts the vectors by their angle with respect to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2()`, which returns the angle in radians.
3. It then calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors (and also up to 100 vectors ahead due to the loop condition) and keeps track of the smallest angle found and the corresponding vector indices.
4. The cosine formula used to calculate the angle between two vectors is correct:
   \[
   \text{angle} = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{\|\mathbf{v}_i\| \|\mathbf{v}_j\|}\right)
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j\) is the dot product of vectors \(\mathbf{v}_i\) and \(\mathbf{v}_j\), and \(\|\mathbf{v}_i\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{v}_j\|\) are their magnitudes.
5. The program correctly outputs the indices of the vectors with the smallest angle.

However, there is an issue with the way pairs are being considered. The loop only considers vectors within a fixed distance (100 vectors ahead) of the current one, which may not capture the minimum angle if the smallest angle is between a vector far apart in the sorted list. This could potentially miss the true minimal angle.

To address this, the program should ideally consider all pairs of vectors, not just those within a limited range.

Given these considerations, the provided program might not always yield the correct result due to its limited scope in pair consideration.
