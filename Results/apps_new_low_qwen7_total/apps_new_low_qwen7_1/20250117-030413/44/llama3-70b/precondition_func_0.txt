The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a vector starting from the origin. The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each coordinate (x_i, y_i) satisfies |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they can have opposite directions.
