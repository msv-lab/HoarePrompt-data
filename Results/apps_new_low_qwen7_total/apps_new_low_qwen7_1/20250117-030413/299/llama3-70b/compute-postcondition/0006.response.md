The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `n` and `k` are described in the constraints but are not passed to the function. Based on the constraints, `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). 

Given the output cases, the function likely calculates something related to `n` and `k`, but since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, we need to focus on what the function might be returning based on the provided constraints.

Case_1: If \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), the function returns a specific value (which is not detailed in the given information).
Case_2: If the conditions are not met (i.e., \(n\) or \(k\) do not satisfy the constraints), the function returns an error message.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a specific value if the input values \(n\) and \(k\) satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), and return an error message otherwise.

Functionality: **The function returns a specific value if the input values \(n\) and \(k\) satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), and returns an error message otherwise.**
