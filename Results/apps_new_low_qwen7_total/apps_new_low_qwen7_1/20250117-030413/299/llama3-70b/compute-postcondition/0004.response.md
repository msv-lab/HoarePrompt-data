The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console but does not change the values of the variables `n` or `k`. The precondition that \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\); and the print statement outputs 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\); the print statement outputs 'NO'.**
