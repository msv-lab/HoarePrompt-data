The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, the values of `n` and `k` will be the integers entered by the user, but the initial constraints are maintained: `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18` and `k ≤ n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 inclusive, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
