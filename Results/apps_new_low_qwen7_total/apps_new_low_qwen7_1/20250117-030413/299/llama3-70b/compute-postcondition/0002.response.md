The code snippet simply prints 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n` and `k`, nor does it change the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k`. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 inclusive, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `(n - 1) // k` is greater than `n // k`; the program prints 'YES'**
