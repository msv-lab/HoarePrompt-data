### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out `k` sticks each.
   - Sasha moves first.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
   - Sasha's goal is to have more moves than Lena.
   - For Sasha to have one more move than Lena, the total number of moves (`n / k`) must be odd (since Sasha goes first, he will have the last move if the number of moves is odd).

3. **Key Observation**:
   - If `n` is divisible by `k`, both players will make an equal number of moves.
   - If `n` is not divisible by `k`, Sasha will have one extra move if the quotient `(n // k)` is odd.

4. **Condition for Sasha's Win**:
   - Sasha wins if the number of moves is odd.
   - This happens if `n % k` is less than `k`.

5. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates `(n - 1) // k` and compares it to `n // k`.
   - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, Sasha has one more move, so he wins.
   - Otherwise, Sasha does not win.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == k`, Sasha will have one more move since `n // k = 1` and `(n - 1) // k = 0`.
   - If `n` is not divisible by `k`, the logic should still hold correctly.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins based on the game rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
