### Reasoning:

To determine if the given solution is correct, let's analyze the logic of the program in relation to the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Sasha starts the game.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly `k` sticks from either the left or the right.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Sasha to make more moves than Lena, he needs to complete an odd number of full rounds (each round consisting of Sasha and Lena making a move).
   - This means Sasha must have the last move. 

3. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The program calculates `(n - 1) // k` and compares it with `n // k`.
   - `(n - 1) // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n-1` (the number of sticks minus one, to ensure there are at least `k` sticks for the next move).
   - `n // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n` (the total number of sticks).

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it implies that the number of complete rounds (where both Sasha and Lena can make a move) is greater than the total number of moves divided by 2.
   - This condition should indicate that Sasha will have the last move and thus make more moves than Lena.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is a multiple of `k`, `n // k` equals `(n - 1) // k`. This means they would end up with the same number of moves, and Sasha wouldn't win.
   - When `n % k == 1`, Sasha can make the last move and win.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly identifies whether Sasha can make more moves than Lena by checking if the number of complete rounds (where both Sasha and Lena can make a move) is greater than the total number of moves divided by 2. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` accurately determines this.

Therefore, the program is logically correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
