Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to the logical flaw in the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k`. Let's re-evaluate this condition and the game rules.

1. **Game Rules and Condition Analysis:**
   - Sasha moves first.
   - Each player takes turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` checks whether the number of Sasha's moves minus one (since he moves first) is greater than the number of Lena's moves.
   - This condition simplifies to checking if Sasha can make an extra move over Lena.

3. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - If `n` is divisible by `k`, both Sasha and Lena can make the same number of moves.
   - If `n` is not divisible by `k`, Sasha will make one more move than Lena if and only if `n % k > 0`.

Given the problem, Sasha makes the first move. Therefore, Sasha will have one more move than Lena if and only if `n % k > 0`.

To confirm this, let's restate the condition in terms of the remainder:
- If `n % k > 0`, Sasha will make one more move than Lena.
- If `n % k == 0`, both players will make the same number of moves.

Thus, the correct condition should be `n % k > 0`.

The provided function summary also aligns with this understanding:
- The function reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- It checks whether `n % k > 0`.
- If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the game, the provided function correctly implements the necessary condition.

Final: **True**
