You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two non-negative integers \(n\) and \(k\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). It then checks whether \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) is greater than \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\). If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range and outputs one of the two possible strings based on the condition. If the inputs do not meet the specified constraints (i.e., \(n\) or \(k\) are outside the allowed range or \(k\) is greater than \(n\)), the function will not execute properly and will likely produce an error, although no specific error handling is provided in the code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw. Specifically, it checks whether `(n - 1) // k > n // k` to determine if Sasha wins. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee that Sasha will make strictly more moves than Lena.

Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 5`

According to the rules, Sasha can cross out 5 sticks on his first turn, leaving 5 sticks. Then Lena can cross out 5 sticks on her turn, ending the game. In this scenario, Sasha makes 1 move, and Lena makes 1 move, so Sasha does not win.

However, the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` evaluates to `False` for this case because:

- `(n - 1) // k = (10 - 1) // 5 = 9 // 5 = 1`
- `n // k = 10 // 5 = 2`

Since `1 <= 2`, the condition is false, and the program outputs "NO", which is incorrect because Sasha does make more moves than Lena in this specific case.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases.
