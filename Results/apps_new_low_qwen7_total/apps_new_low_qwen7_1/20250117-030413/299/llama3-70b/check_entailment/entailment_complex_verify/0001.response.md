### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the original assessment step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the logic.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Sasha starts the game.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly `k` sticks from either the left or the right.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Sasha to make more moves than Lena, he needs to complete an odd number of full rounds (each round consisting of Sasha and Lena making a move).
   - This means Sasha must have the last move.

3. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The program calculates `(n - 1) // k` and compares it with `n // k`.
   - `(n - 1) // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n-1` (the number of sticks minus one, to ensure there are at least `k` sticks for the next move).
   - `n // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n` (the total number of sticks).

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is meant to check if Sasha can complete more full rounds than the total number of moves divided by 2.
   - However, this condition does not accurately determine whether Sasha will have the last move. Instead, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of moves.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - Sasha will have the last move if the total number of moves is odd.
   - The total number of moves is given by `2 * (n // k)` (each round consists of two moves).
   - Therefore, Sasha wins if `2 * (n // k)` is odd, which simplifies to `n // k` being odd.

6. **Correct Program Logic**:
   - We need to check if `n // k` is odd.
   - This can be done using the condition `n // k % 2 == 1`.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is a multiple of `k`, `n // k` is even, and Sasha will not have the last move.
   - When `n % k == 1`, Sasha can make the last move and win, but this is a special case already covered by the overall logic.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine whether Sasha will have the last move. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not equivalent to checking if `n // k` is odd. Therefore, the program is logically incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
