### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given problem and the program's logic step-by-step.

#### Problem Restatement:
- Sasha and Lena play a game where they take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from either the left or the right end of a row of `n` sticks.
- Sasha moves first.
- Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
- We need to determine the winner based on the initial number of sticks `n` and the number of sticks to cross out per turn `k`.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Key Points from Annotations:
- The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input.
- It checks if \((n - 1) // k > n // k\).
- If true, it prints 'YES' indicating Sasha wins.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Critical Points to Consider:
1. **Game Logic**:
   - Each player takes turns crossing out `k` sticks.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes more moves than Lena.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) simplifies as follows:
     - \( (n - 1) // k \) represents the maximum number of moves Sasha can make if he starts with \(n-1\) sticks.
     - \( n // k \) represents the maximum number of moves Sasha can make with \(n\) sticks.
     - This condition checks if Sasha can potentially make one more move than Lena.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(k = 5\):
     - Sasha can cross out 5 sticks, leaving 5 sticks.
     - Lena can then cross out 5 sticks, ending the game.
     - Sasha makes 1 move, and Lena makes 1 move, so Sasha does not win.
     - Condition: \((10 - 1) // 5 = 1\) and \(10 // 5 = 2\), thus \(1 \not> 2\), so the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
   - For \(n = 9\) and \(k = 5\):
     - Sasha can cross out 5 sticks, leaving 4 sticks.
     - The game ends since 4 < 5.
     - Sasha makes 1 move, and Lena cannot move, so Sasha wins.
     - Condition: \((9 - 1) // 5 = 1\) and \(9 // 5 = 1\), thus \(1 \not> 1\), so the program incorrectly outputs 'NO'.

From the above analysis, we see that the condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) is not sufficient to determine the correct winner. Instead, we need to consider the parity of the number of moves:

- If \(n % k == 0\), Sasha and Lena will make an equal number of moves.
- If \(n % k != 0\), Sasha will make one more move than Lena.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program has a logical flaw, and the provided solution does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. The corrected program should check the remainder of `n` divided by `k` to determine the winner accurately.

**Final: False**
