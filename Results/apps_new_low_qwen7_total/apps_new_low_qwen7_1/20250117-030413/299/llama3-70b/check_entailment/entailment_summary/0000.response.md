Reasoning: 
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Sasha wins the game. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from standard input, which matches the problem's requirement.
2. **Win Condition Check**: The program checks whether \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) is greater than \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\). This check determines if Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
3. **Output**: Based on the comparison, it prints 'YES' if Sasha can make more moves, otherwise 'NO'.

However, there is a subtle flaw in the logic. The condition \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) is incorrect for determining if Sasha can make more moves than Lena. The correct approach should consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves each player can make.

Hereâ€™s the correct way to determine the winner:
- If \(n\) is divisible by \(k\), both players will make the same number of moves, and Sasha will not win.
- If \(n\) is not divisible by \(k\), Sasha will make one more move than Lena.

To fix the program, we need to check if \(n \mod k \neq 0\):

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k != 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Given the original implementation and the problem description, the provided solution does not correctly determine the winner. Therefore, the original program as presented is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
