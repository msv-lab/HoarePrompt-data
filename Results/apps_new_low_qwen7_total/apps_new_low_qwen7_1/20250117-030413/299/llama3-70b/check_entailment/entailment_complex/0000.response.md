Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine if Sasha wins the game by checking the floor division condition. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the standard input.
2. **Win Condition Analysis**:
   - Sasha makes the first move, and for Sasha to win, he needs to make more moves than Lena.
   - The key condition to check is whether the number of moves Sasha can make (which is given by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\)) is greater than the number of moves Lena can make (given by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\)).

The logic in the if-else statement correctly implements this condition:
- If \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\), Sasha wins and the program prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, Sasha does not win and the program prints 'NO'.

This logic aligns with the problem requirements and works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified ranges.

However, the program does not handle invalid inputs explicitly. If the inputs do not meet the constraints (e.g., \(n\) or \(k\) are outside the allowed range or \(k\) is greater than \(n\)), the program may still attempt to perform operations that could raise errors. Despite this, the core logic of determining the winner based on the condition is sound.

Given that the provided logic is correct and the question assumes valid inputs as described, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
