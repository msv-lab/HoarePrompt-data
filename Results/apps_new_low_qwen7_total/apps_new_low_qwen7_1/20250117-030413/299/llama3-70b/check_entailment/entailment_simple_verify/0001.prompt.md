You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - 1) // k > n // k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. If \((n - 1) // k\) is greater than \(n // k\), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given solution is correct, let's analyze the logic of the program in relation to the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Sasha starts the game.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly `k` sticks from either the left or the right.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Sasha to make more moves than Lena, he needs to complete an odd number of full rounds (each round consisting of Sasha and Lena making a move).
   - This means Sasha must have the last move. 

3. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The program calculates `(n - 1) // k` and compares it with `n // k`.
   - `(n - 1) // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n-1` (the number of sticks minus one, to ensure there are at least `k` sticks for the next move).
   - `n // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n` (the total number of sticks).

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it implies that the number of complete rounds (where both Sasha and Lena can make a move) is greater than the total number of moves divided by 2.
   - This condition should indicate that Sasha will have the last move and thus make more moves than Lena.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is a multiple of `k`, `n // k` equals `(n - 1) // k`. This means they would end up with the same number of moves, and Sasha wouldn't win.
   - When `n % k == 1`, Sasha can make the last move and win.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly identifies whether Sasha can make more moves than Lena by checking if the number of complete rounds (where both Sasha and Lena can make a move) is greater than the total number of moves divided by 2. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` accurately determines this.

Therefore, the program is logically correct.
