### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the logic of the provided solution and compare it with the actual requirements of the game.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Sasha starts the game.
   - Each player takes turns removing exactly `k` sticks from either the left or the right.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain before a player's turn.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Sasha to make more moves than Lena, he needs to ensure that he has the last move. This means that after his turn, there should be fewer than `k` sticks left, which would end the game.

3. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The program calculates `(n - 1) // k` and compares it with `n // k`.
   - `(n - 1) // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n-1` (the number of sticks minus one, to ensure there are at least `k` sticks for the next move).
   - `n // k` gives the number of times `k` can fit into `n` (the total number of sticks).

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` does not directly address whether Sasha can make the last move. Instead, it checks if the number of complete rounds where both Sasha and Lena can make a move is greater than the total number of moves divided by 2. This is not sufficient to determine if Sasha will have the last move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the example where `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
     - Sasha removes 4 sticks on his first move, leaving 6 sticks.
     - Lena then removes 4 sticks, leaving 2 sticks.
     - Sasha cannot make another move since there are fewer than 4 sticks left.
     - In this case, Sasha and Lena each make one move, resulting in a tie. However, the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` evaluates to `2 > 2`, which is false, incorrectly indicating that Sasha does not win.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine if Sasha wins, we need to check if `n % k == 1`. This is because if `n % k == 1`, Sasha can make the last move and win.
   - If `n % k != 1`, then Sasha and Lena will end up with an equal number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if Sasha will have the last move. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not a valid way to check for this condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
