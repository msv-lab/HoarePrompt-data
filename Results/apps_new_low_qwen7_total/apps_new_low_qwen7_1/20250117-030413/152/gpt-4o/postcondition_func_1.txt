- The function does not handle the case where `block` contains no consonants. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `False` because it assumes the presence of at least three consecutive consonants.
- The function does not explicitly check for the presence of at least three consecutive consonants in the initial condition. This could lead to incorrect results if the substring does not meet this requirement.
- The function returns `False` in the final return statement, which might indicate a missing case handling where it should return `True` if the conditions are met correctly.
