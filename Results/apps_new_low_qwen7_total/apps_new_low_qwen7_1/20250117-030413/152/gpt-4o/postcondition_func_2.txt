The function `func_3` accepts a string `word` and processes it to create a new string where each character of `word` is separated by a space. It achieves this by iterating through each character of `word`, grouping certain sequences of characters based on specific conditions, and then appending these groups to a list. After the main loop completes, it joins all elements in the list into a single string with spaces in between. 

However, there are a few potential edge cases and missing functionalities to consider:
1. If `word` contains only one character, the function will still iterate through it and add it to the result list, which will be returned as a single character with a space before it (e.g., " x ").
2. The function assumes that `func_1` and `func_2` are defined elsewhere and correctly identify characters that should be grouped together and separated. If either `func_1` or `func_2` are not properly defined, the function may produce incorrect results.
3. The code as written does not handle the case where the sequence of characters matched by `func_2` is exactly two characters long and then followed immediately by another sequence that also matches the same criteria. In such cases, the current implementation would treat them as separate groups, which might not be the intended behavior.
