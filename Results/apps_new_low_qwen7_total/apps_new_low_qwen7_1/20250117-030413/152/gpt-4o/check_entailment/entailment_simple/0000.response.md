### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(c)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). It returns `True` if `c` is a vowel and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is implemented correctly and will be used appropriately in `func_3`.

2. **Function `func_2(block)`**:
   - This function checks if a block of consonants (at least 3 characters long) contains at least two different consonants.
   - It iterates through the block and checks if the first consonant differs from any other consonant in the block. If they differ, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - The logic is correct, but the function should return `False` if the block consists of the same character repeated multiple times (i.e., all consonants are the same).

3. **Function `func_3(word)`**:
   - The main logic of the program is implemented correctly. It iterates through the word and splits it whenever a potential typo is found.
   - The logic handles splitting the word when there are three or more consecutive consonants, and ensures that these blocks do not contain all the same consonant.
   - After identifying a typo, the program correctly inserts spaces to break up the word into smaller segments that do not contain typos.

### Analysis of the Implementation:
- The function `func_3` correctly identifies positions where spaces need to be inserted to avoid consecutive consonants longer than three unless all are the same.
- The insertion of spaces is done in a way that minimizes the number of spaces added, which aligns with the problem requirements.
- The overall approach to solving the problem is sound and correctly follows the rules specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation appears to handle all cases as described in the problem statement accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
