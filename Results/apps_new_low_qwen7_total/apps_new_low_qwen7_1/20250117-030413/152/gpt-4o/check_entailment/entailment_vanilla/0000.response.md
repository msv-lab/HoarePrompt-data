### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to identify and correct typos in a given word.
   - A typo is defined as having three or more consecutive consonants where at least two different letters are present.
   - Spaces should be inserted to break the word into parts that do not contain typos.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if a character is a vowel. It correctly returns `True` for vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and `False` for consonants.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if a block of characters has three or more consecutive identical consonants.
   - It should instead check if there are three or more consecutive consonants but with at least two different letters.

4. **Function `func_3` Analysis:**
   - This function processes the word to find and correct typos.
   - It correctly identifies segments of the word that might contain typos.
   - However, the logic for breaking down the word into non-typo segments is flawed. Specifically:
     - It incorrectly handles blocks of consonants and does not ensure that each segment after insertion of spaces is free of typos.
     - The condition `if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):` should check for the presence of at least two different consonants in a block of three or more consonants.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation in `func_3` is flawed because it incorrectly identifies and splits the word based on the conditions given. Therefore, the function will not always produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify and handle typos in the word as per the given problem statement.
