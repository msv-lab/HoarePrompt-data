### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function correctly identifies vowels. Since the only vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', this function is correct and reliable for identifying vowels.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks for a block of at least three consecutive consonants, but it incorrectly returns `False` if the block contains no consonants. It should ideally raise an error or return `None` in such cases, but the primary issue here is the logic itself. The function does not correctly implement the requirement to check for three or more consonants in a row with at least two different letters. Instead, it simply checks if the block has any consonants and returns `True` if they are all the same (which would be considered a typo according to the problem statement).

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The core logic of `func_3` aims to split the word into segments that do not contain typos. However, due to the issues in `func_2`, `func_3` will likely not work correctly. Specifically, `func_2` incorrectly identifies blocks of consonants, leading to incorrect splitting of the word.

Given the above points, especially the flaws in `func_2`, the overall implementation will fail to correctly identify and split words based on the provided criteria.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flaws in `func_2`, which leads to incorrect identification of typos and consequently incorrect splitting of the word.
