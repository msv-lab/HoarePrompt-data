 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    word = input().strip()
    print(func_3(word))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `c` (which is a lowercase English letter) and checks whether `c` is one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. It returns `True` if `c` is a vowel, and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases to consider since the code only checks for vowels and handles the given input type correctly.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  - The function does not handle the case where `block` contains no consonants. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `False` because it assumes the presence of at least three consecutive consonants.
- The function does not explicitly check for the presence of at least three consecutive consonants in the initial condition. This could lead to incorrect results if the substring does not meet this requirement.
- The function returns `False` in the final return statement, which might indicate a missing case handling where it should return `True` if the conditions are met correctly.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a string `word` and processes it to create a new string where each character of `word` is separated by a space. It achieves this by iterating through each character of `word`, grouping certain sequences of characters based on specific conditions, and then appending these groups to a list. After the main loop completes, it joins all elements in the list into a single string with spaces in between. 

However, there are a few potential edge cases and missing functionalities to consider:
1. If `word` contains only one character, the function will still iterate through it and add it to the result list, which will be returned as a single character with a space before it (e.g., " x ").
2. The function assumes that `func_1` and `func_2` are defined elsewhere and correctly identify characters that should be grouped together and separated. If either `func_1` or `func_2` are not properly defined, the function may produce incorrect results.
3. The code as written does not handle the case where the sequence of characters matched by `func_2` is exactly two characters long and then followed immediately by another sequence that also matches the same criteria. In such cases, the current implementation would treat them as separate groups, which might not be the intended behavior.
