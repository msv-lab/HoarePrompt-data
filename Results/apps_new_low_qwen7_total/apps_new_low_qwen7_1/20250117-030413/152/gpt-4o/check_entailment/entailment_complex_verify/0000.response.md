### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and annotations to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Description**: Checks if a character is a vowel.
- **Behavior**: Correctly identifies vowels and returns `True` or `False` based on the character.
- **Annotations**: Accurate.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Description**: Checks if a block of characters consists of at least three consecutive consonants and ensures that these consonants are not all the same.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function correctly checks for the length of the block and ensures that it is at least 3 characters long.
  - It checks if the first character in the block is repeated throughout the block.
  - If the first character is repeated, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotation mentions a missing case handling for blocks with no consonants, but the function actually correctly returns `False` for such cases.
  - The annotation also states that the function always returns `False` in the final return statement, which is incorrect. The function correctly returns `True` when the block of consonants is not uniform.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Description**: Processes the input word to ensure that no blocks of consonants (at least 3 in a row) are uniform and separates them appropriately.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function correctly identifies blocks of consonants and separates them if they are uniform.
  - It ensures that each resulting substring does not contain more than two consecutive identical consonants.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotation mentions a few edge cases and missing functionalities, but the overall logic of the function seems correct based on the provided code.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_2` indeed handles the cases correctly. It returns `False` when the block is uniform and `True` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_2` correctly identifies the cases where a block of consonants is the same letter and its length is greater than three. Thus, the function does not need any corrections based on the provided code.

**Final: True**
