You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'

#Function 2:
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False

#Function 3:
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
