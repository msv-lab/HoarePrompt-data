Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a block of consonants is the same letter and its length is greater than three. According to the problem description, such blocks should not be considered typos. However, the `func_2` function returns `True` for these cases, leading to unnecessary insertion of spaces.

For example, consider the input `"zzzzzzz"`:
- The program should output `"zzzzzzz"` because all letters are the same and do not form a typo.
- However, due to the current implementation of `func_2`, it will incorrectly split the word into `"zz" "zz" "zz"`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
