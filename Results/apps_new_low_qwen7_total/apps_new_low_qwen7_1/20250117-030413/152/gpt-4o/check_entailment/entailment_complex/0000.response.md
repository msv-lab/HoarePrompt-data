Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly identifies vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
   - Handles the given input type correctly without any issues.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function does not correctly implement the requirement for detecting typos.
   - It should check if there are at least three consecutive consonants, but it incorrectly returns `False` when it encounters a block of the same consonant repeated three or more times.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed because it only checks if there is at least one character different from the first consonant, which is not sufficient for identifying a typo according to the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The main function attempts to split the word based on the presence of typos.
   - However, due to the issues in `func_2`, the logic for splitting the word into segments that do not contain typos is incorrect.
   - The function does not properly account for the edge case where the word might consist entirely of consonants, and it does not handle the insertion of spaces to break up the typo blocks correctly.

Given these points, the overall functionality of the program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly identify typos, and `func_3` relies on this incorrect function to perform its operations.

Correctness: **False**
