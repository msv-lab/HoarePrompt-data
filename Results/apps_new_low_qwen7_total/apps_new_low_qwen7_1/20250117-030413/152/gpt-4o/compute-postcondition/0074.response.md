The variables in the loop head are `start` and `i`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `i`. If `start` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is `s + 2` and `i` must be greater than `s + 5`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` must be greater than `s + 5`, `start` should be adjusted to be less than `i`.

Since `i` must be greater than `s + 5`, `start` should be adjusted to be less than `i` but still be `s + 2`. This means `start` should be less than `i`.

State: **`start` is less than `i`, and `i` must be greater than `s + 5`**
