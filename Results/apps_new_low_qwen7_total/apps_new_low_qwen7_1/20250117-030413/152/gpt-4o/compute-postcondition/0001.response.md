Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables Controlling the Loop**: The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and `n`. Specifically, the condition `i < n` determines whether the loop can execute.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is the length of `word`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - Right before the loop, `i` is 0.

5. **Current Value of `n`**:
   - Since `n` is the length of `word`, and `word` is a non-empty string, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (since `word` has a minimum length of 1).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - With `i` being 0 and `n` being the length of `word` (which is at least 1), the condition `i < n` is always true, meaning the loop will definitely execute the first time.

Given this analysis, no changes are needed to the current state for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
