Initial State: `start` is `start + 2`, `i` must be greater than `start + 2`
```

Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the execution:

1. **Line 1:** `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`
   - This line appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending just before `start + 1` to the list `result`.
   - Since `start` is `start + 2`, we need to determine the actual value of `start`. However, the exact value of `start` isn't provided in the initial state, so let's denote it as `start_value`.
   - Therefore, the substring being appended is `word[start_value:start_value + 1]`.

2. **Line 2:** `start += 1`
   - This line increments `start` by 1.
   - After this line, `start` becomes `start_value + 1`.

Since no values for `word` or `result` are given, let's assume the following for illustration purposes (though they are not necessary to derive the final state):

- Let's say `start` was initially 2, so `start + 2` would be 4.
- Then `start` becomes 5 after the increment.

For clarity, let's proceed with `start` being 2 initially:

- The first line appends `word[2:3]` (assuming `word` is a string) to `result`.
- After the append, `start` becomes 3.
- The second line increments `start` to 4.

Now, let's summarize the changes:

- `start` changes from its initial value (which is `start + 2`) to `start + 3`.
- `result` gets a new element which is `word[start - 2]`.

Final State: **start is start + 3, result contains word[start - 2]**
