Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State Before the Loop
- `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `i` is the same as `start`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` contains either the substring `word[3:8]` with `start` and `i` updated accordingly, or includes a new element `word[start:i]` based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute the First Time
1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - Since `i` is initially set to `start`, the loop will only execute if `start < n`.

2. **Condition `func_1(word[i])`:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`.

### Combining Both Conditions
- The loop will execute the first time if both conditions are satisfied simultaneously:
  - `start < n`
  - `func_1(word[start])` returns `True`

### Final State Before the Loop
To ensure the loop executes the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `start < n`
- `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`

Given the information, we can summarize the necessary conditions as follows:

State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `i` is the same as `start`, `n` remains unchanged, and `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`**
