To determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs while `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `False`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `start` is initially set to `i` but is not changed within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented until `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` reaches `n`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `False`.
   - Once `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` equals `n`, the loop stops.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be either `n` or the smallest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. 
   - Since `start` is initially set to `i` and never changes, `start` will be equal to the final value of `i`.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `start`: The final value of `i` after the loop.
   - `i`: The same as `start` because the loop sets `i` to this value before stopping.
   - `n`: Remains unchanged.
   - `result`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify this list.

6. **Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes or Does Not Execute**:
   - The loop will execute if there exists at least one `i` such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `False`.
   - If `func_1(word[i])` is `True` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`, the loop will not execute.

Given the above analysis, the final output state after all executions of the loop will be:

Output State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the same as `start`; `n` remains unchanged; `result` remains unchanged.**
