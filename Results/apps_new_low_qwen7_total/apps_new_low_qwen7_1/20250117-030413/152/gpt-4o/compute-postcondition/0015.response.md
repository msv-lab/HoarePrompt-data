The initial state is: `result` is ['e'], `start` is less than `i`.

The code block is:
```
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

- The first line appends the character at index `start` of `word` to `result`. Since `start` is initially less than `i`, and we assume `word` is a string that can be indexed from `start`, the first character (at `start`) is added to `result`.
- The second line increments `start` by 1.

Assuming `word` is a string that starts with at least one character that `start` can point to (for instance, if `start` is 0 and `word` is "example"), let's proceed with the execution:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: If `start` is 0, then `word[start:start + 1]` would be 'e'. So, `result` becomes `['e', 'e']`.
2. `start += 1`: This increases `start` to 1.

Since no new variables were defined and the only updated variables are `result` and `start`, the final state is:

Output State: **result is ['e', 'e'], start is 1**
