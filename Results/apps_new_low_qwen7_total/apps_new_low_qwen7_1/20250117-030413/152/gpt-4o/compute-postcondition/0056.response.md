The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must evaluate to true for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be one more than its previous value. However, the exact value of `i` was not specified in the initial state, only that it was incremented and the conditions must still be met.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is incremented by 1, `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True`, and `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must still evaluate to true for the next iteration.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True`, and `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must still evaluate to true for the next iteration.**
