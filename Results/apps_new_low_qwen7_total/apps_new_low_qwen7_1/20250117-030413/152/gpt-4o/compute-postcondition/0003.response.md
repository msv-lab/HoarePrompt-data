Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `i < n`: This checks if the index `i` is less than the length `n` of the string `word`.
   - `(not func_1(word[i]))`: This checks if the function `func_1` returns `False` when applied to the character at index `i` in the string `word`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is the length of `word`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `start` is 0.

4. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the loop condition must be true.
   - First, check `i < n`: Since `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of `word`, this part is already satisfied because `0 < n` is always true for any non-empty string.
   - Second, check `(not func_1(word[i]))`: This means `func_1(word[0])` must return `False`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes the first time is `func_1(word[0])` should return `False`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop that allows the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `start` is 0, and `func_1(word[0])` must return False.**
