Given the initial state:
- `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is the length of `word`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if `func_1(word[i])` never returns `True`.
- `start` is `0`.
- `(i - start) is greater than or equal to 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` is `True`.

The provided code snippet:
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 2])
start += 2
```

Let's analyze the impact of these two lines on the given state:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 2])`: This line appends the substring of `word` starting at index `start` and having a length of 2 to the `result` list. After this operation, the value of `start` remains unchanged.

2. `start += 2`: This line increments the value of `start` by 2. 

Since we don't know the exact value of `word` or the outcome of `func_1` and `func_2`, we can infer the following about the final state:
- The substring of `word` starting at `start` and having a length of 2 is appended to `result`.
- `start` is incremented by 2.

Therefore, the final output state will include the new value of `start` and the updated `result` list. Hereâ€™s the output state:

Output State: **result is [substring of word from start to start+1], start is start + 2**.
