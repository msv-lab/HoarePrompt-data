Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop condition is `start < i`. Therefore, the loop head variables are `start` and `i`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns False.
   - `i` is `start + 5`.
   - `result` contains the substring `word[start:start + 2]`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` now contains two elements (the original substring plus one additional character).
   - The substring of `word` from `start` to `i` still satisfies `func_2`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop can continue as long as `start < i`. Given that `i = start + 5`, the only way `start` can be less than `i` is if `start` is incremented.
   - Therefore, we need to increment `start` by 1 to ensure `start < i` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Final state**:
   - `start` must be incremented by 1.
   - `i` remains `start + 5`.
   - `result` will now contain three elements (the original substring plus two additional characters).

State: **`start` is incremented by 1, `i` is start + 5, `result` contains the substring word[start:start + 3]**
