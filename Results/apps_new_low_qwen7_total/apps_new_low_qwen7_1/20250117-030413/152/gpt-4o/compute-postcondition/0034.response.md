To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of this condition need to be true:

1. `i < n`
2. `(not func_1(word[i]))`

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is less than `n` and
- The condition `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the previous value of `i`.

Since `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check `i < n`:**
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

2. **Check `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - We need to ensure that the function `func_1(word[i + 1])` returns `False` when evaluated with the new value of `i`.

Given these conditions, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `func_1(word[i])` (or `word[i]` and `func_1`). Since `func_1` is a function and we cannot directly adjust the function call result, we need to focus on the state of `i` and `word[i]`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `i` should be `i + 1` (since it has already been incremented).
- `func_1(word[i + 1])` must return `False`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`start` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**.

Note that the `start` variable remains unchanged as it was defined at the start of the loop but is not relevant for the continuation of the loop.
