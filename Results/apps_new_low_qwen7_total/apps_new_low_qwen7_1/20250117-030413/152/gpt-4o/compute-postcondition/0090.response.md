The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `word`. `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000. After executing the function body, the function returns a string that is the result of joining all characters of `word` as individual elements with a space in between.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a string `word` and return a new string where each character of `word` is separated by a space.
