The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially incremented by 1 in the previous state, it means `i` was already incremented once before this line of code. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1 again, making it two increments in total since the last known state. The value of `start` remains the same as its initial value, `n` remains unchanged, and the content of `result` depends on the slice operation from `start` to the new value of `i`. The function `func_1(word[i])` must return true for the condition to be satisfied, but its exact return value is not specified and does not affect the updated states of the variables.

Output State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 twice since the last known state; `n` remains unchanged; `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to the new value of `i` (exclusive); `func_1(word[i])` must return true.**
