`i` is incremented by 1. The initial condition was that `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. However, the new value of `i + 1` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine if `i + 1` is still less than `n` or if `func_1(word[i + 1])` returns `False`. But we know that the original conditions about `func_1(word[i])` still apply to the previous value of `i`.

Output State: **`start` is `i`, `i` is less than `n` and the condition `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` is still true for the previous value of `i`; now `i` is increased by 1.**
