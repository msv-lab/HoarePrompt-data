Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while start < i:
    result.append(word[start:start + 1])
    start += 1
```
- **Initial State**: `result` is `[substring of word from start to start+1]`, `start` is `start + 2`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Result**: The `result` list is populated with single characters from `word` starting from index `start`.
- **Start**: Incremented by 1 with each iteration.
- **Word**: Not mentioned to be modified; it remains constant.
- **I**: Not mentioned explicitly but assumed to be the upper limit of the loop.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `start < i`.
2. **Result Update**: In each iteration, a single character from `word` starting from `start` is appended to `result`, and then `start` is incremented by 1.
3. **Final State**: The loop will stop when `start` is no longer less than `i`. Therefore, the final value of `start` will be `i`.

### Verify Relationships
From the provided outputs:
- After 1 iteration: `result = ['e']`, `start = 4`
- After 2 iterations: `result = ['e', 'e']`, `start = 1`
- After 3 iterations: `result = ['e', 'e', 'i']`, `start = 2`

These outputs suggest that the loop appends characters from `word` until `start` reaches `i`.

### Determine the Final Output State
- **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `start < i`.
- **Final Values**: 
  - If the loop executes `n` times, `result` will contain the substring of `word` from `start` to `start + n - 1`.
  - `start` will be set to `i`.

Given the pattern, let's assume the loop needs to execute `n` times to cover all necessary characters. If we assume the initial state is `start = 0` and `i` is the length of `word`, then:
- `start` will reach the end of `word` (i.e., `i`).

For the sake of completeness, let's assume the word is `"example"` and `i` is its length, which is 7. Initially, `start` is `2` (from the initial state). The loop will append characters until `start` equals `7`.

### Final Output State Calculation
- **Word**: `"example"`
- **Initial State**: `start = 2`
- **Iterations**: Loop will execute until `start = 7`, so `n = 7 - 2 = 5` iterations.
- **Result**: After 5 iterations, `result` will be `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **result is ['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e'], start is 7**.
