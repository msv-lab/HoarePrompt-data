Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
- `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).

### Loop Code
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```

### Observations
1. **Condition to Continue Looping**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
2. **Variable `i`**: `i` starts at the smallest index where `func_1(word[i])` is `True` and increments by 1 each time through the loop until `i` is no longer less than `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
3. **Invariants**:
   - `start` remains constant because it is set only once at the beginning.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `result` is updated based on the current value of `i` each time the loop executes, but its size is determined by the final value of `i`.

### Analysis of Output States
- **After 1 iteration**: `i` is incremented by 1.
- **After 2 iterations**: `i` is incremented by 2.
- **After 3 iterations**: `i` is incremented by 3.

From the pattern, we can generalize:
- After \( k \) iterations, `i` is incremented by \( k \).

### Final State After All Iterations
- **Value of `start`**: Remains equal to the initial value of `i`.
- **Value of `i`**: It will be `start + k` where `k` is the number of iterations. The loop terminates when `i` is no longer less than `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- **Value of `n`**: Remains unchanged.
- **Value of `result`**: Contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive). Since `i` is the last valid index that satisfies the loop condition, `result` will be the slice from `start` to `i-1`.

### Conclusion
The loop will terminate when `i` is no longer less than `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` is `False` starting from `start + k` or `n` if no such index exists.

### Output State
Output State: `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `False` starting from `start + k` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive), and the loop has terminated.
