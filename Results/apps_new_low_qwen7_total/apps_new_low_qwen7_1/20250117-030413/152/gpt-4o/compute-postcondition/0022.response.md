Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what conditions must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `result` is a list.
   - `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists.
   - `start` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to satisfy both parts of the condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])`:

- **Condition 1**: `i < n`
  - Since `i` is set to the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time (or `n` if no such index exists), we need to ensure that this index is valid and less than `n`.
  
- **Condition 2**: `func_1(word[i])`
  - This means that there must be at least one index `i` such that `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

Given these conditions, let's restate the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time:

- `i` must be a valid index (less than `n`) where `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`result` is a list, `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists; `start` is 0; and `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must be `True`.**
