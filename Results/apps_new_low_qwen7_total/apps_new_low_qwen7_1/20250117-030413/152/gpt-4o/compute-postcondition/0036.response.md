Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is `i`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and the result of `func_1(word[i])`.
   - From the current state, we know that `i` has already incremented by 1.
   - We also know that `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False`.
   - `start` is just an auxiliary variable and does not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustment is needed for `start`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure that `i` is less than `n`.
- Ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

The final state should be:

**State: `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
