Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `start` is `start + 2`.
   - `result` contains the original slice from `start` to `i` plus an additional slice from `start` to `start + 2`.

3. **Determine the Required Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start < i` must be true.
   - Since `start` is currently `start + 2`, we need to ensure that `start + 2` is less than `i` when the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The current state has `start` as `start + 2`, so we need to make sure that `start + 2` is less than `i`.
   - This means `i` must be greater than `start + 2`.

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `start` is `start + 2`.
- `i` must be greater than `start + 2`.

Putting this into the specified format:

State: **`start` is `start + 2`, `i` must be greater than `start + 2`**
