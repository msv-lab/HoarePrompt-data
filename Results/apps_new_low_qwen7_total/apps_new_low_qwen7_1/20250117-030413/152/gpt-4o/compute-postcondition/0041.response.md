Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `start` and `i`.

2. **Understand the condition of the loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `start < i`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start < i` must be true.

3. **Analyze the given states:**
   - `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - `i` is `start + 5`.
   - `result` contains the substring `word[start:start + 2]`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` remains unchanged.
   - The substring of `word` from `start` to `i` satisfies `func_2`.

4. **Determine the necessary condition:**
   - Given `i = start + 5`, we need to ensure that `start < i` holds true.
   - Substituting `i` with `start + 5`, the condition becomes `start < start + 5`.
   - This condition is always true because adding 5 to any number `start` will always yield a number greater than `start`.

Since the condition `start < i` is inherently satisfied by the given values (as `i` is defined as `start + 5`), no adjustments are necessary to the states to ensure the loop executes the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is `start + 5`; `result` contains the substring `word[start:start + 2]`; `n` remains unchanged; `result` remains unchanged; the substring of `word` from `start` to `i` satisfies `func_2`**
