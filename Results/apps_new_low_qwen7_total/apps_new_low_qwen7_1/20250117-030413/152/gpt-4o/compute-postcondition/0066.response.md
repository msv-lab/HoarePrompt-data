The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and `func_1(word[i])` remain unchanged, meaning `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False`. 

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
