Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step:

### Given Loop:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `i` is `start + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Check in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions need to be satisfied:
     1. `i < n`
     2. `func_1(word[i])` should return `True`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `start + 1`.
   - `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`.

3. **Ensuring the First Condition (`i < n`):**
   - Since `i` is currently `start + 1`, we need to ensure that `i < n` holds true for the next iteration.
   - This means `start + 2` (new value of `i`) should still be less than `n`.

4. **Ensuring the Second Condition (`func_1(word[i])`):**
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True` for the next iteration.

5. **Modifying the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that:
     - `i` is incremented by 1.
     - `func_1(word[start + 1])` must return `True`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the value of `word[start + 1]` to ensure `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True`.

### Final State:
State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `i` is `start + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and `func_1(word[start + 1])` must return `True`.**
