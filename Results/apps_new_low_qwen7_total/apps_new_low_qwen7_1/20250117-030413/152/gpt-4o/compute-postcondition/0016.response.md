The only variable in the loop head is `start`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `start`. If `start` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `start` is less than `i`.

State: **`result` is ['e', 'e'], `start` is 1 and must be less than `i`**
