To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
```

This means the loop continues as long as:
1. `i < n` (index `i` is less than the length of the string `word`)
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` (the function applied to the character at index `i` is false)

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is the length of `word`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `i` is 3.
- `start` is 0.
- `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - Currently, `i` is 3.
   - We need to check if `i` can be incremented to satisfy `i < n`.

2. **Condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - Currently, `i` is 3, so we need to check `func_1(word[3])`.
   - We know that `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`, but we don't have information about `func_1(word[3])` yet.

For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
- `i < n` must hold true.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

### Adjusting the States
- To ensure `i < n`, we need to increment `i` to a value such that `i + 1 < n`.
- To ensure `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, we need to adjust `word` or `func_1` such that `func_1(word[i+1])` returns `False`.

Since we are instructed to adjust only the states that appear in the loop head (`i` and `n`), we need to focus on these variables.

### Conclusion
- The loop can execute one more time if `i` is incremented to a value where both conditions are met.
- Therefore, `i` should be incremented to a value such that `i + 1 < n` and `func_1(word[i+1])` returns `False`.

Given the constraints, the most straightforward way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to set `i` to a value just before `n` and ensure `func_1(word[n-1])` returns `False`.

### Final State
State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `start` is 0, and `func_1(word[3])` returns False**
