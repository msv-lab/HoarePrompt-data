`i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `start + 1`. The function call `func_1(word[i])` is not evaluated in this step, and the condition `i < n` is assumed to remain true. The value of `n` and the contents of `word` and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is `start + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive), and the condition `i < n` is assumed to be true.**
