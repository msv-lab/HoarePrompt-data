Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the conditions `i < n` and `(not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is the length of `word`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `start` is 0.
   - `func_1(word[0])` must return False.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `i < n` and `(not func_1(word[i]))` must be true.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to check if `i < n` is true and if `func_1(word[i])` returns False.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` is currently 1).
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[2])` returns False. Since `word` is a string and we don't know its exact content, we cannot directly adjust `func_1(word[2])`. However, the condition for the loop to continue is based on the value of `word[i]` and the function `func_1`.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that satisfies the condition `i < n` and `(not func_1(word[i]))`. Since `i` is currently 1, the next valid value for `i` would be 2, assuming `n > 2` and `func_1(word[2])` returns False.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the condition related to `func_1(word[i])`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` must be 2, `start` is 0, and `func_1(word[2])` must return False.**
