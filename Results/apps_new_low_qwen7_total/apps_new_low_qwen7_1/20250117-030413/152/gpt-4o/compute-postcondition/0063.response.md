To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as:
1. `i < n`
2. `(not func_1(word[i]))`

### Current State:
- `start` is equal to `i`
- `i` is adjusted to `i + 2`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive)
- `start + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[start + 1])` must return `False`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < n`**
   - The current value of `i` is `i + 2` from the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still be less than `n`.

2. **Condition 2: `(not func_1(word[i]))`**
   - This condition checks that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - After adjusting `i` to `i + 2`, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i + 2])` returns `False`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To satisfy the first condition (`i < n`), `i` must be such that `i + 2 < n`.
- To satisfy the second condition (`(not func_1(word[i]))`), `func_1(word[i + 2])` must return `False`.

Since the loop head variables are `i` and `n`, and the adjustment is based on the conditions provided, we need to ensure these conditions hold true.

### Final State:
- `i` must be adjusted to a value where `i + 2 < n`.
- `func_1(word[i + 2])` must return `False`.

Given the current state, we can adjust the state to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration.

**State:**
**`start` is equal to `i`, `i` is adjusted to a value where `i + 2 < n`, and `func_1(word[i + 2])` must return `False`.**

However, since the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the initial values and the behavior of `func_1`, we focus on the conditions that need to hold true.

**State:**
**`i` must be such that `i + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[i + 2])` must return `False`.**

So, the final state is:

**State: `i` must be such that `i + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[i + 2])` must return `False`.**
