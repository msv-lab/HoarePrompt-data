The initial state is that `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. 

The provided code initializes `n` to the length of `word`, creates an empty list `result`, and sets the index `i` to 0. However, the code does not perform any operations that modify `word`, `n`, `result`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **word is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, n is the length of word, result is an empty list, i is 0**
