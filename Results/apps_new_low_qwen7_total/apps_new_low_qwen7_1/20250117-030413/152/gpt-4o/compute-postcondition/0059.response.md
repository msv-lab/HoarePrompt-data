Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while i < n:`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).

3. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged, the adjustment must focus on `i`.

4. **Adjust `i`**:
   - The current value of `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists.
   - To satisfy the condition `i < n` for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, as long as `func_1(word[i+1])` returns `True`.

5. **Adjustment of States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` to `i + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists; `n` remains unchanged; `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive); `i` is adjusted to `i + 1**.
