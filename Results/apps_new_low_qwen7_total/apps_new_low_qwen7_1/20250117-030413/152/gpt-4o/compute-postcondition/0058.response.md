The code appends a slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive) to the list `result`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- `n` remains unchanged.

After running the line `result.append(word[start:i])`:

- `start` and `i` remain unchanged because the line does not modify them.
- `n` remains unchanged because the line does not modify it.
- `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists; `n` remains unchanged; `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).**
