Postcondition: ***`result` is a list, `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists; `start` is 0. If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` is `True`, then `result` contains `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']`. Otherwise, `result` is an empty list or contains the first character of `word`, and `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` is `False`.***
