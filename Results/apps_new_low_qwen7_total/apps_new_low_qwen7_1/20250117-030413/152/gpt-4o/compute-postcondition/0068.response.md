Postcondition: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is equal to the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`**
