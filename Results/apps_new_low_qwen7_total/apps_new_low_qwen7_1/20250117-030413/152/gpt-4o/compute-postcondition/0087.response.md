Output State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `False` starting from `start + k` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive), and the loop has terminated.**
