Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **Loop Condition**: `i < n and func_1(word[i])`
- **Current State**: 
  - `i` is less than `n`
  - `func_1(word[i])` may or may not return `True`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head consists of two conditions: `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.
   - The first condition `i < n` must remain true.
   - The second condition `func_1(word[i])` must also be true for at least one more iteration.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is already less than `n`, no adjustment is needed for this part.
   - However, `func_1(word[i])` may or may not return `True`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for at least one more iteration.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the state needs to be modified such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for at least one more iteration. This means that `i` should be incremented (so that the next call to `func_1(word[i])` can still be `True`).

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for at least one more iteration**.
