Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start is start + 2, result contains the original slice from start to i plus an additional slice from start to start + 2
Code of the loop:
while start < i:
    result.append(word[start:start + 1])
    start += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: Initial State: `start` is `start + 2`, `i` must be greater than `start + 2`
```

Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the execution:

1. **Line 1:** `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`
   - This line appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending just before `start + 1` to the list `result`.
   - Since `start` is `start + 2`, we need to determine the actual value of `start`. However, the exact value of `start` isn't provided in the initial state, so let's denote it as `start_value`.
   - Therefore, the substring being appended is `word[start_value:start_value + 1]`.

2. **Line 2:** `start += 1`
   - This line increments `start` by 1.
   - After this line, `start` becomes `start_value + 1`.

Since no values for `word` or `result` are given, let's assume the following for illustration purposes (though they are not necessary to derive the final state):

- Let's say `start` was initially 2, so `start + 2` would be 4.
- Then `start` becomes 5 after the increment.

For clarity, let's proceed with `start` being 2 initially:

- The first line appends `word[2:3]` (assuming `word` is a string) to `result`.
- After the append, `start` becomes 3.
- The second line increments `start` to 4.

Now, let's summarize the changes:

- `start` changes from its initial value (which is `start + 2`) to `start + 3`.
- `result` gets a new element which is `word[start - 2]`.

Final State: **start is start + 3, result contains word[start - 2]**
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: start is s + 2, i must be greater than s + 5
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: word is a string, start is 1, i is greater than s + 5, result is ["e"]


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
