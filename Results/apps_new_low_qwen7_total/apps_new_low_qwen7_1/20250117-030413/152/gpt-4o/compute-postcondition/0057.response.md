Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```
This means the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **start**: This variable is only set initially and does not change within the loop.
- **i**: This variable is updated within the loop, starting from the value of `start`.
- **n**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **result**: The problem statement does not mention any direct effect on `result` from the loop itself, but it could be influenced by the logic outside the loop.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`. Each time through the loop, `i` is incremented by 1. The loop stops when `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the given states, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration: `i` becomes `start + 1` and `func_1(word[start])` must be `True`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` becomes `start + 2` and `func_1(word[start + 1])` must be `True`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` becomes `start + 3` and `func_1(word[start + 2])` must be `True`.

Following this pattern, after \( k \) iterations, `i` will be `start + k` and `func_1(word[start + k - 1])` must be `True`.

### Determine the Final Output State
The loop will terminate when `i` equals `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. At that point:
- `start` will remain the same as it was initialized.
- `i` will be `n` or the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` is not directly affected by the loop but may be influenced by the logic outside the loop, possibly containing substrings or elements based on the conditions specified.

Given the pattern observed, the final state of the loop would be:
- `start`: The largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `i`: The largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `result`: Not explicitly mentioned but could be derived from the logic outside the loop.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the largest index such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, or `n` if no such index exists; `n` remains unchanged.**
