Output State: **start is the largest index such that i < n and func_1(word[i]) returns False, i is start + 5, result contains the substring word[start:start + 2], n remains unchanged, result now contains two elements (the original substring plus one additional character), the substring of word from start to i still satisfies func_2**

Explanation:
- Initially, `start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `i` is set to `start + 5`.
- `result` contains the substring `word[start:start + 2]`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains unchanged initially.
- The substring of `word` from `start` to `i` satisfies `func_2`.

After executing the lines of code:
- `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends the substring `word[start:start + 1]` to `result`. This adds one more element to `result`, which was originally `word[start:start + 2]`.
- `start += 1` increments `start` by 1.

Since `result` initially contained `word[start:start + 2]` and then had one more character appended, it now contains `word[start:start + 3]`. The other variables (`start`, `i`, `n`, and the condition related to `func_2`) remain unchanged as per the code.
