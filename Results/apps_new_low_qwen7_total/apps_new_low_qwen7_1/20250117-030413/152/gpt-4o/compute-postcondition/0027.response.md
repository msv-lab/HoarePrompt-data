The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was less than `n`, now `i` is one more than its previous value but is still less than `n`. The condition that `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for at least one more iteration remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for at least one more iteration**
