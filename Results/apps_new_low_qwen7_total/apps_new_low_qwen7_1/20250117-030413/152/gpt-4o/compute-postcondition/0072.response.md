To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `start` and `i`.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `start < i`.
2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `start` is `start + 2`.
   - `i` must be greater than `start + 2`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

- **Current State**: 
  - `start` is `start + 2`.
  - `i` must be greater than `start + 2`.

- **Next Iteration Requirement**:
  - For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must satisfy the condition `start < i`.

Given that `start` is `start + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `start` will become `start + 3`.

Therefore, the condition `start < i` must hold true after `start` is incremented by 1. 

So, the requirement is that `start + 2` (current value of `start`) should be less than `i` in the next iteration. This means `i` must be greater than `start + 3`.

Hence, the state adjustment required is:

**State: **`start` is `start + 3`, `i` must be greater than `start + 3`**
