Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head:** The loop head is `while i < n and func_1(word[i]):`.
2. **Determine which states to adjust:** The states that need to be adjusted are those involved in the loop head conditions, specifically `i` and `n`, as well as the function `func_1(word[i])`.

3. **Current state after the previous iteration:**
   - `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
   - `i` is `start + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive).
   - The condition `i < n` is assumed to be true.

4. **Condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is true.

5. **Adjusting the states:**
   - Since `i` is `start + 1` and the condition `i < n` is true, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - For `func_1(word[i])` to be true, `word[i]` must satisfy the condition defined by `func_1`.

6. **Final state after adjusting:**
   - `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` will now contain the slice from `start` to `i` (exclusive).

Based on this analysis:

**State:**
- `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).
- `func_1(word[i])` must return true.

State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` must be incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `func_1(word[i])` must return true**.
