Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```
This loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `word` (`n`) and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **`word`**: This is the input string and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This is the length of `word` and remains unchanged.
- **`result`**: This is an empty list and remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: This variable starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time the condition in the loop is met.
- **`start`**: This variable is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop increments `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Therefore, `i` will be set to the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time or equal to `n` if `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for all characters in `word`.

### Verify Relationships
From the provided output states, we can infer that:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is 1 and `func_1(word[0])` returns `False`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is 3 and `func_1(word[2])` returns `False`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 5 and `func_1(word[3])` returns `False`.

This pattern suggests that `i` is incremented until it reaches the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time.

### Determine the Final Output State
If the loop executes until `i` equals `n`, then `func_1(word[i])` would eventually return `True` for all characters in `word`, which contradicts the given output states. Therefore, the loop must terminate before `i` reaches `n`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for the last character processed by `i`.

Given this, the final value of `i` will be the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if `func_1(word[i])` never returns `True`.

### Final Output State
- `word`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: The length of `word`.
- `result`: An empty list.
- `i`: The index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if `func_1(word[i])` never returns `True`.
- `start`: Remains 0.

Output State: **word is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, n is the length of word, result is an empty list, i is the index where func_1(word[i]) returns True for the first time, or n if func_1(word[i]) never returns True, start is 0.**
