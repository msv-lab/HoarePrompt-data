The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was initially 0, after executing this line, `i` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0, and `func_1(word[0])` must return False.**
