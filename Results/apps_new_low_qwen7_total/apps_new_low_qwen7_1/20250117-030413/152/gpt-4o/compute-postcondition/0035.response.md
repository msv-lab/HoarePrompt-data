The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was equal to `start`. Since `start` is `i`, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The function call `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`, which means the value of `func_1(word[i])` remains `False`.

Output State: **`start` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
