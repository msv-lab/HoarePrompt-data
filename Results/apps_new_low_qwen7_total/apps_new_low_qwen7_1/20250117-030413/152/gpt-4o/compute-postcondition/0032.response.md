To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
```

This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `(not func_1(word[i]))` which translates to `func_1(word[i])` returning `False`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `start` is `i`
- `i` is less than `n`
- `result` is `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the slice `word[start:i]`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < n`**
   - The state right before the loop already tells us that `i < n`. This condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`**
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when the loop checks the condition.
   - For this to be true, we need to know what `func_1` does. However, since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can only focus on the state of `word[i]`.

### Required State:
- Since `i` is already less than `n`, the main concern is ensuring that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when the loop checks the condition.

Therefore, the state right before the loop must be such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`start` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
