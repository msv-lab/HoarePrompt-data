`result.append(word[start:i])` appends a slice of `word` from index `start` to `i` (excluding `i`) to the list `result`. The values of `start`, `i`, `n`, `result`, and the condition `i - start < 3 or not func_2(word[start:i])` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the same as `start`; `n` remains unchanged; `result` is updated to include a new element `word[start:i]`; `i - start < 3 or not func_2(word[start:i])` remains unchanged.**
