Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
   - `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists plus 1 (if it was less than `n`).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive).
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied.
   - The first condition is `i < n`.
   - The second condition is `func_1(word[i])`.

Given that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure these conditions hold true for the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Since `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for the loop to continue, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` should return `True`.
- **`n`**: `n` remains unchanged as per the current state.

### Final Answer:
The variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition `func_1(word[i])`. Therefore, we need to ensure `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive)**
