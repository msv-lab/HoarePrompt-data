Output State: **start is the largest index such that i < n and func_1(word[i]) returns False; i is start + 5; result contains the substring word[start:start + 2]; n remains unchanged; result remains unchanged; the substring of word from start to i satisfies func_2**

Explanation:
1. The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 2])` appends the substring from `start` to `start + 2` to the list `result`.
2. The second line `start += 2` increments `start` by 2.

Since the initial state had `start` being the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `i` being `start + 3`, and the substring from `start` to `i` satisfying `func_2`, after executing the code block:
- `start` is updated to `start + 2`.
- `i` becomes `start + 3 + 2 = start + 5`.
- The substring from `start` to `start + 2` is appended to `result`.

Thus, the final state includes the updated `start` and `i`, the updated `result`, and the unchanged `n` and `func_2` condition.
