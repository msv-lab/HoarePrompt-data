The variable `start` is assigned the current value of `i`. Since `i` is less than `n`, the value of `start` becomes `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `result` is `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the slice `word[start:i]`**
