Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `i` is either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time.
   - `result` is `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the slice `word[start:i]`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` is either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`.
   - No other states need adjustment as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Thus, the final state after modifying for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`start` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, and `result` is `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the slice `word[start:i]`**.
