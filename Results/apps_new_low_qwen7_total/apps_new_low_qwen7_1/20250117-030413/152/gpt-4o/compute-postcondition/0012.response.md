Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `result` is a substring of `word` from `start` to `start+1`.
   - `start` is currently at `start + 2`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while start < i:`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `start` must be less than `i`.

3. **Determine the Required State:**
   - Since `start` is currently at `start + 2`, we need to adjust this value to meet the condition `start < i`.
   - Therefore, `start` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
- The current state of `start` is `start + 2`.
- To satisfy the loop condition `start < i`, `start` must be less than `i`.

Given the current state, `start` must be adjusted such that `start` is less than `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is [substring of word from start to start+1], start is less than i**
