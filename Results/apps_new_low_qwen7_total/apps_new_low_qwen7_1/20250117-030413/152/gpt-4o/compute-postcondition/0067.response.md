Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```
This means the loop continues as long as the index `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- `start`: Initially set to `i`, and does not change during the loop.
- `i`: Increased by 1 each time the loop condition is met (i.e., `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`).
- `n`: Remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `result`: Initially contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), but its content is not relevant to the loop condition or the final state of `i`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

The loop increments `i` until either:
1. `i` reaches `n`, or
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Thus, the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as both conditions hold true.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration: `start` is `i`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `result` contains the slice from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `start + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `False`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is increased by 1.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is increased by 1 again, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

This pattern indicates that after each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop stops when `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` reaches `n`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will be true:
- The loop will stop if either `i` equals `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- Therefore, the final value of `i` will be either `n` or the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` and `k < n`.

Given these points, the final output state is:
Output State: `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is equal to the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, and `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).
