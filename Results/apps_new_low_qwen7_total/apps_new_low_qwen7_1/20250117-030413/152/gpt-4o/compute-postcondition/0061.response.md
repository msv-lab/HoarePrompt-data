To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `start` is equal to `i` (initially).
   - `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).

### Determining the Necessary Conditions:

- **Condition 1**: `i < n`
  - Since `i` is adjusted to `i + 1` after the initial assignment, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < n` for the loop to execute the first time.
  
- **Condition 2**: `(not func_1(word[i]))`
  - This condition checks if `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. Therefore, `word[i]` should not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `i + 1 < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` (i.e., `word[i]` should not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`).

Given the initial state where `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, the first time the loop runs, `i` would be `start + 1`. Therefore, we need `start + 2 < n` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

### Final Answer:

State: **`start` is equal to `i`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `start + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[start + 1])` must return `False`.**
