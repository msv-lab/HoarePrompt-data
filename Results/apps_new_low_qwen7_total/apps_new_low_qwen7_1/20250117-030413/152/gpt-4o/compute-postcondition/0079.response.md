Postcondition: ***`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is equal to the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `result`'s length increases by 1 if the `else` part is executed or by 4 if the `if` part is executed.***
