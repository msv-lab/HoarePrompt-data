The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `start` is 0, and `func_1(word[2])` returns False.
