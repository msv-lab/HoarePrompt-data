The value of `i` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be one more than its original value. However, since `i` must remain less than `n`, if `i` was already equal to `n`, it would stay the same. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists plus 1 (if it was less than `n`), `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i-1` (exclusive), and `i` must be less than `n`.**
