Given the initial state:
- `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`
- `i` is equal to the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists
- `n` remains unchanged
- `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive) and `i - start >= 3`
- `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`

And the code snippet:
```
result.append(word[start:start + 2])
start += 2
```

Let's break down the effects of the code:

1. `result.append(word[start:start + 2])`: This appends the slice of `word` from `start` to `start + 2` (exclusive) to `result`.
2. `start += 2`: This increments `start` by 2.

Since the exact values of `word`, `start`, `i`, and `n` are not given, we can only describe the general impact of these lines based on the conditions specified.

Assuming the conditions are met (`i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`), the slice `word[start:start + 2]` will be appended to `result`, and `start` will be incremented by 2.

Output State: **start is start + 2, result contains the original slice from start to i plus an additional slice from start to start + 2**, `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

This is the most specific output state we can provide without knowing the exact values of `word`, `start`, `i`, and `n`.
