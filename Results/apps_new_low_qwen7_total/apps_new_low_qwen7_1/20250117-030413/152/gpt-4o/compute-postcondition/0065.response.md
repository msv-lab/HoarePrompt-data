Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and the result of `func_1(word[i])`.
   - However, the state provided only includes `i` (which is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, two conditions must be met:
     1. `i < n`
     2. `(not func_1(word[i]))`

4. **Current state**:
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - We don't have information about `n` or `word[i]`.

5. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `i` has been incremented, the new value of `i` should be considered.
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to check if `i` is still less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Given the current state (`i` is increased by 1), the necessary adjustments would be:
- Ensure `i` is still less than `n`.
- Ensure `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Since the state only includes `i` being increased by 1, we need to adjust `n` to ensure the first condition holds true.

State: **`i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**
