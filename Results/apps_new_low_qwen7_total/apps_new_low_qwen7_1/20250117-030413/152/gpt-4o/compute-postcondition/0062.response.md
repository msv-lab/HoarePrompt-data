The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was adjusted to `i + 1` to start with, and this operation is performed again. Therefore, `i` is now incremented by another 1. The other variables (`start`, `n`, `result`, and the condition involving `func_1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is equal to `i`; `i` is adjusted to `i + 2`; `n` remains unchanged; `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive); and `start + 2 < n` and `func_1(word[start + 1])` must return `False`.**
