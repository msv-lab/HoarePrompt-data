The code `start = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `start`. Since `i` is initially 0, `start` is also assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `start` is 0.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the length of `word`, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `start` is 0**
