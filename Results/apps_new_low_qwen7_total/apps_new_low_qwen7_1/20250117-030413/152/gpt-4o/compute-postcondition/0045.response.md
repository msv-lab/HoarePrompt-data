The variables in the loop head are `start` and `i`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `i`. If `start` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 2 and `i` is 6. Since `start` (2) is less than `i` (6), the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to adjust any other states.

State: **`start` is 2, `i` is 6**
