The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `start`, which is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. After executing `i += 1`, `i` will be one more than its previous value, which means `i` will now be equal to `start + 1`.

The conditions that `func_1(word[start])` returns `True` and `i < n` remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the function `func_1` itself also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is now `start + 1`
- `start` remains the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`

Output State: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `i` is `start + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `func_1(word[start])` must return `True`**
