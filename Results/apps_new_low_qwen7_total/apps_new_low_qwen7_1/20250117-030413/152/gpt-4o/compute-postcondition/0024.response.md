To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
```

This means the loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

### Current State
- `result` is a list (its exact content is not relevant for this task)
- `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists
- `start` is 0
- `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:

1. **Condition 1: `i < n`**
   - The current value of `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Condition 2: `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`**
   - The function `func_1` must return `True` when called with `word[i]`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` before incrementing `i`.

### Adjusting the States
Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that satisfies both conditions.

### Final State Adjustment
The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these variables. We need to ensure that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

State: **`i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`**
