The code `result.append(word[start:i])` appends a slice of `word` from index `start` to `i` (exclusive) into the list `result`. 

From the initial state, `start` is 0, `i` is either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time, and `result` is an empty list or contains `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` based on the conditions `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` being `True`.

Let's consider the two scenarios for `i`:

1. If `i` is `n` (or the length of `word`), then the slice `word[start:i]` is `word[0:n]`, which means the entire string `word` is appended to `result`. Since `start` is 0, this would append the whole word to `result`.

2. If `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time, and this index satisfies `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` is `True`, then the slice `word[start:i]` up to this index is appended to `result`.

In both cases, the `result` list gets updated with a new element.

Given the conditions, if `i` is such that the slice satisfies the conditions, then `result` will contain `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the new slice appended.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is 0, `i` is either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time, and `result` is `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` plus the slice `word[start:i]`.**
