The code assigns the current value of `i` to `start`. This means that the value of `start` is updated to be the same as the current value of `i`. The values of `n`, `result`, and the previous value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is equal to `i`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `result` now contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive)**
