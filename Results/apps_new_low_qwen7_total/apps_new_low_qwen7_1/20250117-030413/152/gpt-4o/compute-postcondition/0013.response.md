It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the provided code snippet and the context. The given code snippet is incomplete and does not provide a full picture of the program's state or the value of `i`. Additionally, the initial state and the variables involved are not clearly defined in the snippet. However, I will assume that `start` is initially set to `start + 2` (which means it is 2 more than its intended starting value) and needs to be adjusted so that `start < i` for the loop to proceed correctly. Also, I'll assume `word` is a string and `result` is a list where substrings of `word` are being appended.

Let's assume the initial state is as follows based on the provided context:
- `start` is `start + 2` (let's say `start` is initially 2 more than its intended value).
- `i` is some value greater than the adjusted `start`.
- `word` is a string.
- `result` is an empty list.

We need to adjust `start` so that `start < i` and then execute the given lines of code.

### Code Execution:
1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: This line appends a substring of `word` starting at `start` and ending just before `start + 1` to the `result` list.
2. `start += 1`: This line increments `start` by 1.

### Example Scenario:
Assume `start` is initially 3 (which means it is 2 more than its intended value), `i` is 10, `word` is "example", and `result` is an empty list.

1. `start` is initially 3.
2. After `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`, the substring "e" is appended to `result`, so `result` becomes `['e']`.
3. After `start += 1`, `start` becomes 4.

### Final State:
- `result` is `['e']`.
- `start` is 4.

### Output State:
Output State: **result is ['e'], start is 4**
