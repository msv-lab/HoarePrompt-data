Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
2. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
3. **Current States**:
   - `i` has been incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`).
   - `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True` (implying that `func_1` evaluated as true for the current value of `word[i]`).

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be satisfied:
- `i < n` must be true.
- `func_1(word[i])` must be true.

Given that `i` has just been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i < n` and that `func_1(word[i])` evaluates to true for the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Since `i` has just been incremented, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
- **`n`**: We need to ensure `n` remains such that `i < n` holds true.
- **`func_1(word[i])`**: We need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` evaluates to true for the next value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
To satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is true. Since `i` has already been incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `n`, and `func_1(word[i])` must evaluate to true.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `func_1(word[start + 1])` returns `True`, and `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must evaluate to true for the next iteration**.
