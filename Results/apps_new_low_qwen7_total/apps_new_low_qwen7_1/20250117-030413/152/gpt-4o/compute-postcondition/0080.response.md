Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
   - `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive).
   - The length of `result` increases by 1 if the `else` part is executed or by 4 if the `if` part is executed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

3. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop must be satisfied:
     1. `i < n`
     2. `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

Given the initial state:
- We know `i` is the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists. This means that `func_1(word[i])` will return `True` at this point (since we are starting from the first valid index).

Therefore, the only condition we need to ensure for the first iteration is that `i < n`.

So, the state right before the loop must ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is equal to the smallest index `k` such that `func_1(word[k])` returns `True` or `n` if no such index exists, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive), and `i` must be less than `n`.**
