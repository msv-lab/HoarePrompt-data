Postcondition: **`start` is the largest index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`; `i` is the same as `start`; `n` remains unchanged; `result` contains either the substring `word[3:8]` with `start` and `i` updated accordingly, or includes a new element `word[start:i]` based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**
