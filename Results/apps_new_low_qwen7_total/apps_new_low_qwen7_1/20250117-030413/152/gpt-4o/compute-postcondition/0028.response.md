Let's analyze the given code and the provided states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `result`: Either an empty list, a list containing `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']`, or the first character of `word` depending on the conditions.
- `i`: The index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists.
- `start`: 0.

### Code of the loop:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Invariants and Variables**:
   - `start` remains constant at 0 throughout the loop.
   - `i` starts at the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time (or `n` if no such index exists) and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - `n` and `word` are constants relative to the loop's logic but are not directly changed by the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - Each iteration increments `i` by 1 until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

3. **Conditions After Loop Completion**:
   - If the loop terminates because `i` reached `n` (i.e., `i == n`), it means that `func_1(word[i])` returned `False` for all indices up to `n-1`.
   - If the loop terminates because `func_1(word[i])` returned `False` for the current `i`, it means that `func_1(word[i])` was `True` up to that point but then became `False`.

### Final State Determination:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be either `n` (if the condition `func_1(word[i])` was `False` for all `i` up to `n-1`) or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returned `False` for the first time (if the condition `func_1(word[i])` eventually becomes `False`).
- The value of `start` remains 0.
- The value of `result` depends on the relationship between `i - start` and 3, and whether `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.

### Final Output State:
- If `i == n`, then `i - start = n > 3` only if `n > 3` and `func_2(word[0:n])` is `True`. Otherwise, `result` is an empty list.
- If `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, then `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[0:i])` may or may not be `True`, leading to `result` being either an empty list or the first character of `word`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the loop is determined by the following conditions:
- `start` remains 0.
- `i` will be either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time.
- `result` is determined by the values of `i` and the outcome of `func_2(word[start:i])`.

Output State: **`start` is 0, `i` is either `n` or the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the first time, and `result` is an empty list or contains `['x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']` based on the conditions `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` being `True`.**
