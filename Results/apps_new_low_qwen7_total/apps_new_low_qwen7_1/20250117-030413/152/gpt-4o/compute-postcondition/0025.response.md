`i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was originally less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, incrementing `i` by 1 maintains the condition that `i` is less than `n`. However, the truth value of `func_1(word[i])` is not guaranteed after the increment because `i` now points to the next index in the list.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` may or may not return `True`**
