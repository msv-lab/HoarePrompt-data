`result.append(word[start:i])` appends a slice of `word` from index `start` to index `i` (exclusive) to the list `result`. Based on the initial state, `i` is less than `start` + 3 or `i` is equal to `n` where `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `start` remains the same. After appending the slice to `result`, the length of `result` increases by 1.

Output State: **`start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, `i` is equal to a value less than `start` + 3 or `i` is equal to `n` where `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`, `n` remains unchanged, `result` contains the slice of `word` from `start` to `i` (exclusive) appended to it, and the length of `result` has increased by 1.**
