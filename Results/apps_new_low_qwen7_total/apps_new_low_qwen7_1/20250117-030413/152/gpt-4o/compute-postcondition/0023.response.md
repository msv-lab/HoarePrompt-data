`i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must be `True`. Since `i` is incremented, the condition `i < n` is still valid, but the condition `func_1(word[i])` might no longer be `True` because `i` has been incremented to point to the next element in the list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is a list, `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists; `start` is 0; and `i` is now one more than the original value, but `func_1(word[i])` might no longer be `True`.

Output State: **`result` is a list, `i` is the index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` for the first time, or `n` if no such index exists; `start` is 0; and `i` is incremented by 1.**
