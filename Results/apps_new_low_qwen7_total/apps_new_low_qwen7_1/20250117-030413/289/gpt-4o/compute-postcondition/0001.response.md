The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` within the range 2 <= n <= 10^18. However, since no specific condition or output is provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` within the range 2 <= n <= 10^18.**
