The initial state is defined as `n` being an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^18`.

Let's consider the execution of the code block:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`.
2. `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1`: This line calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form (excluding the sign bit) and subtracts 1 to get `max_games`. The result is stored in `max_games`.
3. `print(max_games)`: This line prints the value of `max_games`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `n` initially, let's denote the input integer as `k` where `2 <= k <= 10^18`. After running the code, `n` will be set to `k`, and `max_games` will be `k.bit_length() - 1`.

For a general case, if `n` (or `k`) is a power of 2, say `2^m`, then `n.bit_length()` would be `m + 1` because `2^m` in binary is a '1' followed by `m` zeros. Therefore, `max_games` would be `m`.

Given this, the final output state will be:

Output State: **n is an integer k such that 2 <= k <= 10^18, max_games is n.bit_length() - 1**
