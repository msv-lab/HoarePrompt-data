Functionality: **The function takes an integer \( n \) as input where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), calculates the maximum number of games that can be played based on the bit length of \( n \) minus one, and prints this value. The function does not return a value; instead, it directly outputs the calculated result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, but the function correctly performs the intended calculation for the given range of \( n \).**
