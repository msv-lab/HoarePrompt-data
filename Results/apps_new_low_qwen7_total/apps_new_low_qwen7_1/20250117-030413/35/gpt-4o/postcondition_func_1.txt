The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x` derived from positive integers `a` and `b` (representing the number of pieces of two cakes) and a positive integer `n` (representing the number of plates). It returns `True` if `(a // x) + (b // x)` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of both cakes among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. The function does not modify the input variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is `1` (resulting in `a + b // x`), or when `x` is greater than both `a` and `b` (resulting in `0 + 0`).
