### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake.
   - The binary search is performed over the range from 1 to \( \min(a, b) + 1 \).
   - The variable `low` starts at 1, and `high` starts at \( \min(a, b) + 1 \). The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.
   - Inside the loop, the midpoint `mid` is calculated.
   - The function `can_distribute(mid)` is called to check if it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `mid` pieces.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, it means it’s possible to distribute the cakes with at least `mid` pieces per plate, so we move the lower bound `low` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, we move the upper bound `high` down to `mid`.

2. **Function `can_distribute(x)`**:
   - This function checks if it’s possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces.
   - It calculates the total number of plates needed to accommodate at least `x` pieces from both cakes: \( \left\lfloor \frac{a}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{x} \right\rfloor \).
   - If this total is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Initial Conditions and Loop Invariant**:
   - The binary search ensures that the final value of `low` will be the maximum \( x \) such that each plate can have at least \( x \) pieces, because:
     - Initially, `low` is set to 1, and `high` is set to \( \min(a, b) + 1 \).
     - During each iteration, the binary search narrows down the range, and when `low` becomes equal to `high`, the loop ends.
     - The last value of `low` (which is also `high`) will be the largest \( x \) where the condition \( \left\lfloor \frac{a}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{x} \right\rfloor \geq n \) holds true.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `low - 1`, which is the correct answer since `low` is the point where the distribution condition fails for the first time.

Given that the binary search logic and the `can_distribute` function are correctly implemented to ensure the constraints are met, the program should work as expected.

### Correctness: **True**
