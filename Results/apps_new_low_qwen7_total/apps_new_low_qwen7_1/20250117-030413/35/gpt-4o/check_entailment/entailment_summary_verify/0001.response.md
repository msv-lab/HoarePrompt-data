### Reasoning:
1. **Binary Search Approach**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. This approach is correct as it efficiently narrows down the possible values of `x` using the divide-and-conquer strategy.
2. **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for `low` and `high` is set correctly, with `low` starting at 1 and `high` starting at `min(a, b) + 1`. This ensures that `low` will never exceed `high`, and the upper limit of `high` is appropriate given the constraints.
3. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` equals `high`. During each iteration, `mid` is calculated, and the helper function `can_distribute(mid)` checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `mid` pieces of cake. This part is correct as well.
4. **Helper Function**: The `can_distribute` function correctly calculates whether it is possible to distribute the cakes by checking if the total number of pieces divided by `x` (considering both cakes) is greater than or equal to `n`. The logic here is sound.
5. **Final Result**: The result `low - 1` is returned, which represents the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions. However, there is a potential issue with the initial setup of `high`.

The initial setup of `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`. This is not necessarily correct because it assumes that the maximum number of plates required would be the smaller of the two cake pieces plus one. However, the actual maximum number of plates needed could be less than `min(a, b) + 1` depending on the values of `a` and `b`. For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 6`, the maximum number of plates would be 3, but `min(a, b) + 1` would be 4, which is incorrect.

A more appropriate initial setup for `high` would be `a + b`, which guarantees that the search space includes all possible valid distributions.

### Corrected Binary Search Range:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, a + b)
```

With this corrected initial setup, the binary search will correctly narrow down the range and ensure that the maximum possible value of `x` is found.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the above reasoning, the original assessment was accurate except for the initial setup of the `high` variable in the binary search. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
