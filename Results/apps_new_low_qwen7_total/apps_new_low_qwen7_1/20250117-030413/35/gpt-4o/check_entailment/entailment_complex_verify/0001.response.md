### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Approach**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
2. **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for `low` and `high` is set correctly, considering the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The upper limit of the range is `min(a, b) + 1` because we cannot have more than `min(a, b)` plates if each plate must have at least one piece of cake from either one of the cakes.
3. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` equals `high`. During each iteration, `mid` is calculated, and the helper function `can_distribute(mid)` checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `mid` pieces of cake.
4. **Helper Function**: The `can_distribute` function correctly calculates whether it is possible to distribute the cakes by checking if the total number of pieces divided by `x` (considering both cakes) is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. **Final Result**: The result `low - 1` is returned, which represents the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `can_distribute` function. Specifically, the condition `a // x + b // x >= n` is not sufficient to ensure that each plate gets at least `x` pieces of cake from either one of the cakes. Instead, it checks if the total number of pieces (from both cakes combined) can be distributed among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces, but it does not ensure that the pieces are distributed properly among the cakes.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5`, `a = 3`, and `b = 3`. According to the current logic, the function would determine that `x = 1` is possible because `3 // 1 + 3 // 1 = 6 >= 5`. However, this does not guarantee that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. In fact, it might happen that all three pieces of one cake are placed on the same plate, and the other two plates get one piece each from the second cake, which does not satisfy the requirement that no plate should contain pieces from both cakes.

To fix this, the `can_distribute` function needs to ensure that the distribution of pieces from both cakes is balanced across the plates. One way to achieve this is by ensuring that the pieces from each cake are distributed separately, and the total number of pieces from each cake is at least `n`.

### Corrected Helper Function:
```python
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x >= n or b // x >= n
```

With this corrected helper function, the program ensures that the pieces from each cake are distributed such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake, satisfying the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the current logic of `can_distribute` was sufficient to meet the problem's constraints. The corrected logic ensures that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake.

**Final: False**

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `can_distribute` function.
