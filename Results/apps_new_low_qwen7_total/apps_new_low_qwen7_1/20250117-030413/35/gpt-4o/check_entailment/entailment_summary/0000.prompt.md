 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). It uses a binary search algorithm to find the smallest integer `k` such that `can_distribute(k)` returns `True`. The function returns `k - 1`, which is one less than the transition point where `can_distribute(mid)` changes its boolean value from `False` to `True` or vice versa. If no such `k` exists, the function will return the maximum possible value within the given constraints, i.e., `min(a, b)`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to the minimum of `a` and `b` plus one.
2. Enters a loop that continues until `low` equals `high`.
3. Inside the loop, calculates `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
4. Calls the `can_distribute(mid)` function and adjusts `low` or `high` based on the result.
5. Returns `low - 1` after the loop terminates, which is the desired transition point minus one.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `can_distribute(mid)` always returns `False`, the loop will run until `low` equals `high`, and the function will return `min(a, b) - 1`. This ensures the function handles cases where the condition is never met.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x` derived from positive integers `a` and `b` (representing the number of pieces of two cakes) and a positive integer `n` (representing the number of plates). It returns `True` if `(a // x) + (b // x)` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of both cakes among `n` plates such that each plate gets at least one piece from each cake. The function does not modify the input variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is `1` (resulting in `a + b // x`), or when `x` is greater than both `a` and `b` (resulting in `0 + 0`).
