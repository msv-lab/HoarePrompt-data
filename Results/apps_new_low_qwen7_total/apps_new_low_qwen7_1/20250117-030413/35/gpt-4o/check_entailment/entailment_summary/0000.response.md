Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation (`func_1`)**:
   - The `func_1` function uses binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that all plates have at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - The binary search is correctly initialized with `low` as 1 and `high` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus one.
   - The `can_distribute` function is called with the midpoint value `mid` to check if it is feasible to distribute the cakes with at least `mid` pieces per plate.
   - The binary search logic correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the result of `can_distribute(mid)`.
   - The function returns `low - 1`, which represents the maximum feasible value `x`.

2. **Feasibility Check (`can_distribute`)**:
   - The `can_distribute` function checks if the sum of the quotient of `a` and `x` and the quotient of `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - This function correctly evaluates whether it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
   - The function handles edge cases appropriately, including when `x` is 1 (which would mean each plate gets one piece from each cake, totaling `a + b` pieces distributed among `n` plates).

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem by using binary search to find the maximum number `x` such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake.

Correctness: **True**
