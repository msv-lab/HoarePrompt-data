Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake.
   - The `low` variable is initialized to 1, and `high` is set to the minimum of \( a \) and \( b \) plus one. This ensures that the binary search operates within a valid range.
   - The loop continues until `low` equals `high`, ensuring that we find the exact transition point where the distribution condition changes.
   - The `can_distribute(mid)` function call is used to check if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `mid` pieces.
   - The function correctly returns `low - 1` as the answer, which is the largest value of \( x \) for which the distribution is possible.

2. **Function `can_distribute`**:
   - The function checks if the total number of pieces of both cakes divided by \( x \) (integer division) is at least \( n \).
   - This is a correct implementation because if each plate must contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake, then the total number of pieces of both cakes divided by \( x \) should be at least the number of plates \( n \).

Given these points, the overall logic of the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. The functions work together to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
