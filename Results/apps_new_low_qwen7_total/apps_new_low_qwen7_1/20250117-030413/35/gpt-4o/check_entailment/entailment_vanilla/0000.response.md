### Reasoning:
1. **Binary Search Approach**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
2. **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for `low` and `high` is set correctly, considering the constraints \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The upper limit of the range is `min(a, b) + 1` because we cannot have more than `min(a, b)` plates if each plate must have at least one piece of cake from either one of the cakes.
3. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` equals `high`. During each iteration, `mid` is calculated, and the helper function `can_distribute(mid)` checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `mid` pieces of cake.
4. **Helper Function**: The `can_distribute` function correctly calculates whether it is possible to distribute the cakes by checking if the total number of pieces divided by `x` (considering both cakes) is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. **Final Result**: The result `low - 1` is returned, which represents the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

Given the logic and the constraints, the implementation appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
