### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Approach**: The function `func_1` indeed uses binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
2. **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for `low` and `high` is set correctly. However, there is a subtle issue here. The upper limit `high` should be `a + b` instead of `min(a, b) + 1`. This is because the maximum number of plates that can be filled is `a + b`, not `min(a, b)`. For example, if there are 2 pieces of cake and 3 pieces of cake, and 5 plates, the maximum `x` could be 1 (one piece from each cake per plate).
3. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` equals `high`. During each iteration, `mid` is calculated, and the helper function `can_distribute(mid)` checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `mid` pieces of cake.
4. **Helper Function**: The `can_distribute` function correctly calculates whether it is possible to distribute the cakes by checking if the total number of pieces divided by `x` (considering both cakes) is greater than or equal to `n`. However, there is a logical error in the helper function itself. The condition `a // x + b // x >= n` might not always correctly reflect the requirement that no plate can have pieces from both cakes. It should ensure that either the first or the second cake's pieces fill up the plates without mixing them.
5. **Final Result**: The result `low - 1` is returned, which represents the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

To fix the helper function, we need to consider the constraint that no plate can contain pieces from both cakes. A corrected approach would be to check if either `a // x >= n` or `b // x >= n`.

### Corrected Helper Function:
```python
def can_distribute(x):
    return (a // x >= n) or (b // x >= n)
```

With this correction, the original assessment's logic and conclusion are not fully accurate. The range for `high` needs adjustment, and the helper function needs to be modified to correctly reflect the constraint.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the range for `high` and the helper function not correctly reflecting the constraint that no plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
