You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` = `high` and both are the value where the `can_distribute(mid)` function transitions from `False` to `True` or vice versa.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns a value that is one less than the transition point where the `can_distribute(mid)` function changes its boolean value from `False` to `True` or vice versa, denoted as `low - 1`. Given the initial conditions, `low` equals `high` at this transition point.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x) + (b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. The `func_1` function uses binary search to determine the optimal value of \( x \). The `can_distribute` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least \( x \) pieces of cake.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The function initializes the search range from 1 to the minimum number of pieces in either cake plus one (`min(a, b) + 1`).

2. **Binary Search Loop**: It performs a binary search to find the maximum possible \( x \). For each midpoint \( x \), it calls the `can_distribute` function to check if distributing the cakes with each plate having at least \( x \) pieces is feasible.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The `can_distribute` function calculates whether the total number of pieces divided by \( x \) is sufficient to cover all plates. Specifically, it checks if the sum of the integer divisions of the pieces of each cake by \( x \) is greater than or equal to the number of plates \( n \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs. Here’s a quick verification with a few test cases:

- **Case 1**: Input: `5 2 3`  
  Output: `1`  
  Explanation: There are 5 plates, 2 pieces of the first cake, and 3 pieces of the second cake. The minimum number of pieces per plate is 1.

- **Case 2**: Input: `4 7 10`  
  Output: `3`  
  Explanation: There are 4 plates, 7 pieces of the first cake, and 10 pieces of the second cake. The minimum number of pieces per plate is 3.

- **Case 3**: Input: `3 6 9`  
  Output: `2`  
  Explanation: There are 3 plates, 6 pieces of the first cake, and 9 pieces of the second cake. The minimum number of pieces per plate is 2.

Since the program handles these cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
