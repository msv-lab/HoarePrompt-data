To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it. The loop condition is `low < high`.

Let's analyze the given information:

- `low` and `high` are updated based on the return value of `can_distribute(mid)`.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then `low` is updated to \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) and `high` is updated to \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
- If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, then `low` is updated to 1 and `high` is updated to \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

For the loop to continue (`low < high`), the following conditions must be true:
1. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then the new `low` should be less than the new `high`. This is already ensured because \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1 < \min(a, b) + 1\).
2. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, then the new `low` (1) should be less than the new `high` \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

Since both conditions ensure that `low < high` when the loop is executed, the loop can definitely execute one more time regardless of the values of `low` and `high` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary because the loop condition `low < high` is always satisfied given the constraints on `low` and `high` based on the `can_distribute(mid)` function.

State: **No adjustment needed**
