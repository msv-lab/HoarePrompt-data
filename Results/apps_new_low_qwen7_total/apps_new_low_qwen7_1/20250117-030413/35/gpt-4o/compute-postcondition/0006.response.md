The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is 1, `high` is \((min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), `mid` is \((min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), and `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is 1, `high` is \((min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), `mid` is \((min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), and `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`**
