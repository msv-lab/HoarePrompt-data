The code assigns the value of `mid + 1` to `low`. Given that `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\) and `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, the value of `low` changes to `mid + 1`. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and the value of `mid` also remains unchanged because `mid` is recalculated only when necessary.

Output State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True.`**
