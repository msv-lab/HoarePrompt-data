Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). It uses a binary search algorithm to find the smallest integer `k` such that `can_distribute(k)` returns `True`. The function returns `k - 1`, which is one less than the transition point where `can_distribute(mid)` changes its boolean value from `False` to `True` or vice versa. If no such `k` exists, the function will return the maximum possible value within the given constraints, i.e., `min(a, b)`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to the minimum of `a` and `b` plus one.
2. Enters a loop that continues until `low` equals `high`.
3. Inside the loop, calculates `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
4. Calls the `can_distribute(mid)` function and adjusts `low` or `high` based on the result.
5. Returns `low - 1` after the loop terminates, which is the desired transition point minus one.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `can_distribute(mid)` always returns `False`, the loop will run until `low` equals `high`, and the function will return `min(a, b) - 1`. This ensures the function handles cases where the condition is never met.**

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a value that is one less than the transition point where `can_distribute(mid)` changes its boolean value from `False` to `True` or vice versa, ensuring the function adheres to the specified constraints and edge cases.**
