The code assigns the value of `(low + high) // 2` to the variable `mid`. The variables `low` and `high` are not modified by this operation, so their values remain unchanged. The new value of `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is unchanged**
