`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), `low` becomes \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), and `can_distribute(mid)` returns True.
