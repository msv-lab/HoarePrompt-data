The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The function returns a value that is one less than the transition point where the `can_distribute(mid)` function changes its boolean value from `False` to `True` or vice versa, denoted as `low - 1`.
