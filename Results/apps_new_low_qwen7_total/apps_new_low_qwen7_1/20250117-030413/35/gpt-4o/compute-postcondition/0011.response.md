The code `high = mid` assigns the current value of `mid` (which is `(low + high) // 2`) to `high`. The value of `low` remains unchanged, and the previous value of `mid` is also replaced by the current value of `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
