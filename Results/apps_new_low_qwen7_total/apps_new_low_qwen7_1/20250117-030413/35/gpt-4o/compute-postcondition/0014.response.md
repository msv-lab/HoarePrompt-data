The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` reassigns the value of `mid` to be the integer division of `(low + high)`. This means that the new value of `mid` is the same as its previous value because the initial state already defines `mid` as `(low + high) // 2`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, where `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` is unchanged, and `high` is unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`.

Output State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` is unchanged, `high` is unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True.`**
