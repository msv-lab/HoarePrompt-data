The code `low = mid + 1` changes the value of `low`. Initially, `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and both `low` and `high` remain unchanged. After executing the code, `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, substituting this into the equation gives `low = (low + high) // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged**
