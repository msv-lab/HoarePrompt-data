`high` is assigned the value of `mid`. According to the precondition, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, the condition `high` is unchanged if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True` is satisfied. Therefore, after the assignment, `high` becomes `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is unchanged, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`**
