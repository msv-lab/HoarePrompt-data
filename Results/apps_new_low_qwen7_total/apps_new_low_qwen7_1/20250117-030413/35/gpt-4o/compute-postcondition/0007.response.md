Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then `low` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1\) and `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, then `low` is 1 and `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).***
