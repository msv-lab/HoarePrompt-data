Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, groups is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, max_pairs_per_row is 4 * n, total_pairs_needed is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line reads input from stdin using `sys.stdin.read` and stores it as a string.
- The second line splits the string into a list of strings.
- The third line converts the first two elements of the list to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- The fourth line converts the remaining elements of the list to integers and creates a list called `groups`.
- The fifth line calculates `max_pairs_per_row` as `4 * n`.
- The sixth line initializes `total_pairs_needed` to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
