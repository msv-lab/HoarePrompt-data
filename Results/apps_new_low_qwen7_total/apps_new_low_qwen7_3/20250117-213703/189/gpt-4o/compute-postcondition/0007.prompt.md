Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, groups is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, max_pairs_per_row is 4 * n, total_pairs_needed is 0
Code of the loop:
for soldiers in groups:
    total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: The code updates the `total_pairs_needed` variable by adding `(soldiers + 1) // 2` to its current value. Here, `soldiers` is the first element of the `groups` list, which means `soldiers = groups[0]`. Since `groups` is a list of `k` integers, `soldiers` is an integer between 1 and 10000 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the initial value of `total_pairs_needed` as `T`. After the code executes, `total_pairs_needed` will be updated to `T + (groups[0] + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, and the list must have at least one element; `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`; `total_pairs_needed` is `T + (groups[0] + 1) // 2`; `soldiers` is the first element of the `groups` list (i.e., `groups[0]`).**
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, and the list must have at least two elements; `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`; `total_pairs_needed` is `T + (groups[0] + 1) // 2 + (groups[1] + 1) // 2`; `soldiers` is `groups[1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, and the list must have at least two elements; `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`; `total_pairs_needed` is `T + (groups[0] + 1) // 2 + 2 * (groups[1] + 1) // 2`; `soldiers` is `groups[1]`


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
