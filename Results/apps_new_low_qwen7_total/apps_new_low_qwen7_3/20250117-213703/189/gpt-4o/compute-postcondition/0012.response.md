Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`, `total_pairs_needed` is `T + sum((soldier + 1) // 2 for soldier in groups)`, and `soldiers` is the last element of the `groups` list (i.e., `groups[-1]` if `groups` has more than one element). If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, no further action is taken. If `total_pairs_needed` is greater than `max_pairs_per_row`, the program continues execution according to the else part.**
