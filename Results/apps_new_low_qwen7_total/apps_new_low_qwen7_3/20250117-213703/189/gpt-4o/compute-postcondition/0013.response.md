The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and the sum of k integers \(a_i\) (1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ 10000) is less than or equal to 8·n. The function returns a value based on the conditions given in the output cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, and returns a value based on the given conditions.**
