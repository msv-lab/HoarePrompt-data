Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, along with a list of `k` integers `groups` representing the number of soldiers in each of `k` groups, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000`. It calculates the total number of pairs needed, which is the sum of `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each group, and compares this total with `4 * n` (the maximum number of pairs per row). If the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to `4 * n`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input is valid and follows the specified constraints. However, there are no checks to ensure that the input values meet these constraints. For example, if `n` or `k` are out of bounds, or if the sum of `groups` exceeds `8 * n`, the function would still proceed without validating these conditions.
- There is no handling for empty input lists (`groups`). If `groups` is an empty list, the function would still proceed with the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.
- The function does not handle cases where the sum of elements in `groups` is greater than `8 * n`. While this is covered in the edge case above, it should be explicitly mentioned.
- There are no error messages or exceptions raised for invalid inputs. The function relies on the input being correct and within the specified ranges.
