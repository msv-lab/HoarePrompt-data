The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, along with a list of `k` integers `groups` representing the number of soldiers in each of `k` groups, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000`. It calculates the total number of pairs needed, which is the sum of `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each group, and compares this total with `4 * n` (the maximum number of pairs per row). If the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to `4 * n`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
