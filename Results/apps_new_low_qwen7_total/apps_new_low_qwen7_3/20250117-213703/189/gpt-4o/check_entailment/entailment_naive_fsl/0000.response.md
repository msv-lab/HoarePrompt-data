Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the soldiers can be arranged in the airplane such that no two soldiers from different groups sit on neighboring seats. Specifically, the program calculates the total number of pairs of soldiers needed but does not consider the seating arrangement constraints.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2 2
5 8
```
According to the problem description, we need to ensure that soldiers from different groups do not sit in neighboring seats. However, the program's logic does not account for this constraint. It only checks if the total number of pairs needed fits within the available pairs per row, which is not sufficient.

A correct approach would involve simulating the seating arrangement and ensuring that no two soldiers from different groups are placed in neighboring seats. The current implementation does not provide this check, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
