### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Group Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and separates the number of rows (`n`) and the number of groups (`k`).
   - It then calculates the total number of pairs needed by summing up \((\text{number of soldiers in a group} + 1) // 2\) for each group. This is correct because each pair of soldiers requires one pair of non-neighboring seats.

2. **Capacity Check:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be seated per row, which is `4 * n` (since each row has 4 pairs of non-neighboring seats).
   - It then checks if the total number of pairs needed can fit within the available capacity.
   - If the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to the maximum capacity, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to arrange the soldiers without any two soldiers from different groups sitting in neighboring seats. This logic is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including when the number of groups and soldiers does not exceed the constraints, ensuring the solution works for all valid inputs within the specified limits.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
