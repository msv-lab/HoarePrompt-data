You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

 [Image] A row in the airplane 

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

 [Image] 

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))
    max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n
    total_pairs_needed = 0
    for soldiers in groups:
        total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
    if total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`, along with a list of `k` integers `groups` representing the number of soldiers in each of `k` groups, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000`. It calculates the total number of pairs needed, which is the sum of `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each group, and compares this total with `4 * n` (the maximum number of pairs per row). If the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to `4 * n`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Group Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and separates the number of rows (`n`) and the number of groups (`k`).
   - It then calculates the total number of pairs needed by summing up \((\text{number of soldiers in a group} + 1) // 2\) for each group. This is correct because each pair of soldiers requires one pair of non-neighboring seats.

2. **Capacity Check:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be seated per row, which is `4 * n` (since each row has 4 pairs of non-neighboring seats).
   - It then checks if the total number of pairs needed can fit within the available capacity.
   - If the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to the maximum capacity, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to arrange the soldiers without any two soldiers from different groups sitting in neighboring seats. This logic is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including when the number of groups and soldiers does not exceed the constraints, ensuring the solution works for all valid inputs within the specified limits.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.
