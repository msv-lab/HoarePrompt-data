Reasoning: 
1. The program reads the input correctly and splits it into `n`, `k`, and the list of group sizes.
2. It calculates the maximum number of pairs (two-seat combinations) that can be seated in the airplane, which is `4 * n`.
3. It then calculates the total number of pairs needed to seat all soldiers from different groups such that no two soldiers from different groups sit in neighboring seats. This is done by adding up `(soldiers + 1) // 2` for each group size, which ensures that each group is paired optimally without exceeding the pair limit per row.
4. Finally, it checks if the total number of pairs needed is less than or equal to the maximum number of pairs available (`max_pairs_per_row`). If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program is sound and correctly implements the required algorithm. The calculations and conditions are appropriate for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
