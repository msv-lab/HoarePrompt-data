Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of k groups of soldiers, the i-th group contains a_{i} soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has n rows, each of them has 8 seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6} or {7, 8}.

Daenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.

Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000), where a_{i} denotes the number of soldiers in the i-th group.

It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{k} ≤ 8·n.


-----Output-----

If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
5 8

Output
YES

Input
1 2
7 1

Output
NO

Input
1 2
4 4

Output
YES

Input
1 4
2 2 1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:

In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.

In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats (1, 2, 7, 8), and the second group an all the remaining seats.

In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats (1, 2) and (7, 8), the third group on seats (3), and the fourth group on seats (5, 6).

# Annotated Program:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and the sum of k integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10000) is less than or equal to 8·n.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

k = int(data[1])

groups = list(map(int, data[2:]))

max_pairs_per_row = 4 * n

total_pairs_needed = 0
    for soldiers in groups:
        total_pairs_needed += (soldiers + 1) // 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive; `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`; `total_pairs_needed` is `T + sum((soldier + 1) // 2 for soldier in groups)`; `soldiers` is the last element of the `groups` list (i.e., `groups[-1]` if `groups` has more than one element).
    if (total_pairs_needed <= max_pairs_per_row) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `groups` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10000 inclusive, `max_pairs_per_row` is 4 * `n`, `total_pairs_needed` is `T + sum((soldier + 1) // 2 for soldier in groups)`, and `soldiers` is the last element of the `groups` list (i.e., `groups[-1]` if `groups` has more than one element). If `total_pairs_needed` is less than or equal to `max_pairs_per_row`, no further action is taken. If `total_pairs_needed` is greater than `max_pairs_per_row`, the program continues execution according to the else part.
