#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^6.
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False since there is no integer x in the range 1 <= x <= 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range 1 to \(10^6\) (inclusive) and returns `False`. This is because the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` always results in a non-zero value for any integer `x` in this range. Therefore, there is no integer `x` in the specified range such that `x & (x + 1)` equals 0. This holds true for all possible values of `x` within the given range, making the function return `False` in every case.

                n -= 1

                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: count is 40; x is an integer such that x = 0 or 1 <= x <= 10^6 and x is odd.
    return count, operations
    #The program returns count which is 40, and operations which is not specified in the given code snippet
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. It iterates up to 40 times, performing a series of operations on `x` based on the value of `count`. Specifically, if `count` is even, it repeatedly finds the highest set bit in `x` and clears it using bitwise operations until no more bits can be cleared. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After 40 iterations, regardless of the intermediate states of `x`, the function returns a tuple containing the integer `count` with a value of 40 and a list `operations` that records the indices of the bits cleared during the even iterations. The final state of `x` will either be 0 or an odd number within the specified range.
