Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << n) - 1 <= x`.

2. **Understand the Variables Involved**: 
   - `n` is the variable used in the loop condition.
   - `x` is another variable involved in the condition.

3. **Current States**:
   - `count` is 0.
   - `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
   - `count % 2 == 0` is true (since `count` is 0).

4. **Focus on the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(1 << n) - 1 <= x` must be true.
   - We don't have any information about `x` directly, but we know `func_1(x)` returns `False`. This doesn't affect the loop condition directly.

5. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - Since `count` is 0 and `count % 2 == 0` is true, there are no restrictions on `n` from the current values of `count`.
   - To make the loop condition true, we need `(1 << n) - 1 <= x` to be satisfied.

6. **Simplify the Condition**:
   - The expression `(1 << n) - 1` represents a number that has `n` bits set to 1 (e.g., `1 << 3` - 1 = 7).
   - For the smallest possible `n`, let's start with `n = 0`.
     - When `n = 0`, `(1 << 0) - 1 = 0`.
     - The condition becomes `0 <= x`, which is always true as long as `x` is non-negative.
   - However, we need to ensure the loop can execute at least once, so `n` should be at least 1.
     - When `n = 1`, `(1 << 1) - 1 = 1`.
     - The condition becomes `1 <= x`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` should be at least 1 and `x` should be at least 1.

Given this analysis, the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time are:

- `count` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `x` must be at least 1.

Since `func_1(x)` returns `False` and doesn't affect the loop condition directly, we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`count` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` must be at least 1**
