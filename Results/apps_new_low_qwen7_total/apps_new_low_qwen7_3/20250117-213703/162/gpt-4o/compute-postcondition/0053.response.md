`n` is incremented by 1, starting from 0, so the new value of `n` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is an integer and must be less than 40; `x` remains an even integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); the operations list remains unchanged; `n` is 1.**
