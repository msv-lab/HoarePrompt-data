The loop condition is `not func_1(x) and count < 40`. For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:

1. `not func_1(x)` - This means `func_1(x)` should return `False`.
2. `count < 40` - This means `count` should be less than 40.

At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is 1, and `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `count` is still less than 40, which it already is (since `count` is 1), and `func_1(x)` returns `False`.

Since `x`'s value does not change within the loop (as per the information given), we do not need to adjust its state. The only state that needs adjustment is `count`, which must remain less than 40.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs no modification for the loop to proceed to the next iteration, as `count` is already less than 40.

State: **`count` is 1; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\)**
