The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables `count` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition `n == 0` is true, which means `n` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is 0**
