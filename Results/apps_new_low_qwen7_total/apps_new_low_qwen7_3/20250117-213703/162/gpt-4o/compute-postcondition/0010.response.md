Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
    n += 1
```
The initial state is:
- `count` is 0.
- `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
- The condition `count % 2 == 0` is true.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- `count` remains unchanged inside the loop and is initially 0.
- `n` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time the condition in the while loop is true.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues to increment `n` as long as `(1 << n) - 1 <= x`. The expression `(1 << n) - 1` represents \(2^n - 1\), which is the largest number with exactly \(n\) bits set to 1 in binary form.

#### Example Iterations:
- For `x = 0`, the loop will run until \(2^1 - 1 = 1 > 0\), so it runs 1 time, setting `n` to 1.
- For `x = 1`, the loop will run until \(2^2 - 1 = 3 > 1\), so it runs 2 times, setting `n` to 2.
- For `x = 2`, the loop will run until \(2^3 - 1 = 7 > 2\), so it runs 3 times, setting `n` to 3.

From the given output states, we see that:
- After 1 iteration, `n` is at least 2.
- After 2 iterations, `n` is at least 3.
- After 3 iterations, `n` is at least 4.

### Step 4: Determine Final Values
- The loop continues until \((1 << n) - 1 > x\). Thus, the loop will stop when \(2^n - 1 > x\).
- Since `count` remains 0 throughout the loop, the final value of `count` will be 0.
- The final value of `n` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\).

### Final Output State
The loop will terminate when \(2^n - 1 > x\), meaning \(n\) is the smallest integer greater than \(\log_2(x + 1)\).

Output State: **count is 0, n is the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\), and x is any non-negative integer.**
