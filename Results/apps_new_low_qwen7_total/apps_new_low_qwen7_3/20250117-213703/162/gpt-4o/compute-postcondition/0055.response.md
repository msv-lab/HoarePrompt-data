`n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer and must be less than 40; `x` remains an even integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); the operations list remains unchanged; `n` is 3.
