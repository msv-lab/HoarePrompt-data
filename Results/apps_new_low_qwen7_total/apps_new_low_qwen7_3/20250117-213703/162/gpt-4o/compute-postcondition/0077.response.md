Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. It iterates up to 40 times, performing a series of operations on `x` based on the value of `count`. Specifically, if `count` is even, it repeatedly finds the highest set bit in `x` and clears it using bitwise operations until no more bits can be cleared. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After 40 iterations, regardless of the intermediate states of `x`, the function returns a tuple containing the integer `count` with a value of 40 and a list `operations` that records the indices of the bits cleared during the even iterations. The final state of `x` will either be 0 or an odd number within the specified range.**

**Edge cases:**
- If `x` starts as 0, the function will immediately return (40, []). This is because clearing bits from 0 results in 0, and incrementing 0 by 1 also results in 1, which is an odd number.
- If `x` is already an odd number, the function will only perform increment operations and will not clear any bits.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the return value for `operations` is not specified in the given code snippet, so it is assumed to be a list of integers representing the indices of the bits that were cleared during the even iterations. However, this list is not defined or initialized in the code provided. Therefore, the actual content of `operations` depends on the implementation of the missing parts of the code.
