`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 21, so after the operation, `n` becomes 20. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer and must be less than 40; `x` remains an even integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and the 20th bit of `x` must be 1; the operations list remains unchanged; `n` is 20.
