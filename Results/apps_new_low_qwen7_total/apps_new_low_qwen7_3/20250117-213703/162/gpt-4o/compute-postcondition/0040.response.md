`n` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state where `n` must be 1, after decrementing, `n` becomes 0. The values of `count` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and its least significant bit is 1, `n` is 0**
