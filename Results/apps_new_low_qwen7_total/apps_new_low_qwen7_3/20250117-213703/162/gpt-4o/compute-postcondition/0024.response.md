Postcondition: **`count` is 0; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), either incremented by 1 or remaining the same, depending on the result of `func_1(x)`; `func_1(x)` returns `False`.** 

Explanation:
- If `count % 2 == 0` (which is always true since `count` is initially 0), the if part executes.
  - In the if part, `x` is set to 4.
  - `func_1(x)` returns `False`.
- If `count % 2 != 0` (which never happens since `count` is always 0), the else part executes.
  - In the else part, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and is set to its original value plus 1.
  - `func_1(x)` returns `False`.

Since `count` is always 0, the overall postcondition considers both parts but simplifies to the case where `x` can either be 4 or be incremented by 1 from its original value, ensuring `func_1(x)` returns `False` in both scenarios.
