`n` is decremented by 1, which means the new value of `n` is the original value minus 1. The state of `count` and the condition about the highest set bit of `x + 1` remaining at position `n - 1` are unaffected.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is `original_n - 1`, and the highest set bit of `x + 1` must be at position `original_n - 2`**
