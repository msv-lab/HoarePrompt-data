The code `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Given the initial state where `n` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{(n-1)} - 1 \leq x < 2^n - 1\), and the highest set bit of \(x + 1\) must be at position `n-1`, after decrementing `n` by 1, the new value of `n` is `n - 1`. The condition involving `x` remains unchanged because the operation only affects `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `count` is still 0.
- `n` is now `n - 1`.
- The condition involving `x` remains valid.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is `n - 1`, and the highest set bit of `x + 1` must be at position `n`**.
