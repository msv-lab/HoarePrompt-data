The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so `n` changes from 3 to 4. The values of `count` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); `n` is 4.

Output State: **`count` is 1; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); `n` is 4**
