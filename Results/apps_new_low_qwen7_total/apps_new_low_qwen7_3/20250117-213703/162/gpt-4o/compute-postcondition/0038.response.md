`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 1, so after executing `n -= 1`, `n` becomes 0. The states of the other variables (`count` and `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and its least significant bit is 1, `n` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and its least significant bit is 1, `n` is 0**
