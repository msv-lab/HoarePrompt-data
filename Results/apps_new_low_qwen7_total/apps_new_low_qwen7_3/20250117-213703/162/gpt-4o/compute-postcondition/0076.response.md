The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^6. The function returns two values: `count`, which is an integer and has a fixed value of 40, and `operations`, which is not specified in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 10^6, and return `count` with a value of 40 and another unspecified value for `operations`.
