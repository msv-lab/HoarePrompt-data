`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is the smallest integer such that \(2^n - 1 > x\). After decrementing `n` by 1, the new value of `n` will be one less than the original value. The conditions about `count` being 0 and the highest set bit of \(x + 1\) being at position `n-1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{(n-1)} - 1 \leq x < 2^n - 1\), and the highest set bit of \(x + 1\) must be at position `n-1`.**
