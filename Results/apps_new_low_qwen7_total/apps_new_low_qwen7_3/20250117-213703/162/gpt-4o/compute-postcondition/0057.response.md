The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Given that the initial value of `n` was 3, after executing `n += 1`, the new value of `n` will be 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is an integer and must be less than 40; `x` remains an even integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\); the operations list remains unchanged; `n` is 4**.
