`count` is incremented by 1 because `count += 1` adds 1 to the current value of `count`. Since `func_1(x)` returns `False`, `x` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\). The initial state of `count` is 0, so after the increment, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is 1; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\)**
