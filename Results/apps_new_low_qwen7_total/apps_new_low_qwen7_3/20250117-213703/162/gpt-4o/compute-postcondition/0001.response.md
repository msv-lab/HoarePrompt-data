Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is `not func_1(x) and count < 40`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both parts of the condition must be true at the start of the loop.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\).
   - `operations` is an empty list (this doesn't affect the loop condition directly).
   - `count` is 0.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `count` must be less than 40, which is already satisfied since `count` is initially 0.
   - The more critical part is `not func_1(x)`. This means `func_1(x)` must return `False` for the loop to proceed.

4. **Modifying the Program State:**
   - Since `count` is already 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure `func_1(x)` returns `False`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(x)` must return `False`. Given that `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), we just need to ensure that `x` is such that `func_1(x)` returns `False`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^6 and func_1(x) returns False**
