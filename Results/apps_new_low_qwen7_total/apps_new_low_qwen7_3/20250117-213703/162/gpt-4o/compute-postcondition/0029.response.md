`n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `count` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), `n` is 1.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), `n` is 1**
