`x` is incremented by 1. The initial state is that `count` is 0 and `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\), and `func_1(x)` returns `False`. After executing `x += 1`, the value of `x` changes, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 0; `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\) and equals its original value plus 1; `func_1(x)` returns `False`**
