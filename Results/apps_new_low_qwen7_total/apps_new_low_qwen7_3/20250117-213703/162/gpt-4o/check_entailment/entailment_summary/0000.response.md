Reasoning:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to transform a given integer \( x \) into a perfect longcat (i.e., a number of the form \( 2^m - 1 \)) using a series of operations where odd-numbered operations clear the highest set bit of \( x \) and even-numbered operations increment \( x \) by 1. This process continues for at most 40 operations.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if \( x \) is of the form \( 2^m - 1 \). However, since it always returns `False`, it does not serve the intended purpose. This function is not used in the transformation process.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function performs the required operations to transform \( x \) into a perfect longcat. It correctly implements the logic:
   - If the count of operations is even, it finds the highest set bit in \( x \) and clears it.
   - If the count of operations is odd, it increments \( x \) by 1.
   - The process stops after at most 40 operations.
   - The function returns the number of operations performed and the list of operations (indices of bits cleared).

4. **Execution Summary of `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates up to 40 times.
   - It correctly alternates between clearing the highest set bit and incrementing \( x \).
   - The final output format is correct, printing the number of operations followed by the list of operations.

Given that `func_2` correctly implements the required transformation logic and handles the constraints properly, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
