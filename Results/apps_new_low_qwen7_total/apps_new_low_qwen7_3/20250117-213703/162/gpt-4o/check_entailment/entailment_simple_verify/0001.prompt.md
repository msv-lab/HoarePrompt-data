You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
39

Output
4
5 3 
Input
1

Output
0

Input
7

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the Cat Furrier Transform as per the problem description.

1. **Understanding `func_1`**: The function `func_1(x)` checks if `x` is a power of two minus one. This is done using the condition `x & x + 1 == 0`, which works because a number that is a power of two minus one has all bits set to one up to a certain point and zero after that. However, the primary objective here is to transform any number `x` into a perfect longcat within the given constraints.

2. **Main Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to perform the required operations.
   - It initializes an empty list `operations` to store the values of `n` for odd-numbered operations.
   - It uses a `while` loop to keep performing operations until either the number becomes a perfect longcat (`func_1(x)` returns `True`) or the limit of 40 operations is reached.
   - In each iteration:
     - If the current operation number is odd, it finds the largest `n` such that `(1 << n) - 1` is less than or equal to `x`. It then applies the XOR operation to transform `x` and appends `n` to the `operations` list.
     - If the current operation number is even, it simply increments `x` by 1.
   - It keeps track of the number of operations performed in the variable `count`.

Given the logic in `func_2`, the program aims to correctly apply the Cat Furrier Transform by alternating between the XOR operation and incrementing, ensuring the number eventually becomes a perfect longcat (a power of two minus one).

To verify correctness, let's consider a few examples:

- **Example 1**: Input `39`
  - `39` is not a perfect longcat.
  - `39 ^ 31 = 56`
  - Increment `56` to `57`
  - `57 ^ 7 = 62`
  - Increment `62` to `63` (which is \(2^6 - 1\))
  - This sequence matches the expected output of 4 operations: `5 3`

- **Example 2**: Input `1`
  - `1` is already a perfect longcat.
  - No operations are needed, so the output is `0`.

- **Example 3**: Input `7`
  - `7` is already a perfect longcat.
  - No operations are needed, so the output is `0`.

The provided code appears to handle these cases correctly. The function alternates between the XOR operation and incrementing, and it ensures that the number of operations does not exceed 40.

Correctness: **True**
