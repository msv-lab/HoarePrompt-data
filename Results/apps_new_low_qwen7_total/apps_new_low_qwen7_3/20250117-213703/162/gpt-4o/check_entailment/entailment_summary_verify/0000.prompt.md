You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0

#Function 2:
def func_2(x):
    operations = []
    count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        count += 1
    return (count, operations)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. It iterates up to 40 times, performing a series of operations on `x` based on the value of `count`. Specifically, if `count` is even, it repeatedly finds the highest set bit in `x` and clears it using bitwise operations until no more bits can be cleared. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After 40 iterations, regardless of the intermediate states of `x`, the function returns a tuple containing the integer `count` with a value of 40 and a list `operations` that records the indices of the bits cleared during the even iterations. The final state of `x` will either be 0 or an odd number within the specified range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the Cat Furrier Transform according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Check**: The `func_1` function checks if the current value of `x` is a perfect longcat by verifying if `x & (x + 1) == 0`. This is a correct way to check if `x` is of the form \(2^m - 1\).

2. **Transformation Logic**: The `func_2` function iterates up to 40 operations, alternating between Operation A and Operation B as required. 
   - For odd-numbered operations, it identifies the highest bit set in `x` and applies the XOR operation to clear that bit.
   - For even-numbered operations, it simply increments `x` by 1.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the constraint of performing at most 40 operations and ensures that it stops early if `x` becomes a perfect longcat before reaching the limit.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all cases correctly within the specified constraints. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or specific input that would cause the program to fail based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
