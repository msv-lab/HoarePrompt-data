Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----

39

Output
4

-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.

# Annotated Functions:
x = int(input())
(t, ops) = func_2(x)
print(t)
for i in range(0, len(ops), 2):
    print(ops[i], end=' ')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^6.
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0
    #The program returns False since there is no integer x in the range 1 <= x <= 10^6 such that x & (x + 1) equals 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range 1 to \(10^6\) (inclusive) and returns `False`. This is because the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` always results in a non-zero value for any integer `x` in this range. Therefore, there is no integer `x` in the specified range such that `x & (x + 1)` equals 0. This holds true for all possible values of `x` within the given range, making the function return `False` in every case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^6.
def func_2(x):
    operations = []

count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: count is 40; x is an integer such that x = 0 or 1 <= x <= 10^6 and x is odd.
    return count, operations
    #The program returns count which is 40, and operations which is not specified in the given code snippet
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. It iterates up to 40 times, performing a series of operations on `x` based on the value of `count`. Specifically, if `count` is even, it repeatedly finds the highest set bit in `x` and clears it using bitwise operations until no more bits can be cleared. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After 40 iterations, regardless of the intermediate states of `x`, the function returns a tuple containing the integer `count` with a value of 40 and a list `operations` that records the indices of the bits cleared during the even iterations. The final state of `x` will either be 0 or an odd number within the specified range.
