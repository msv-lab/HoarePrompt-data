The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range 1 to \(10^6\) (inclusive) and returns `False`. This is because the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x + 1` always results in a non-zero value for any integer `x` in this range. Therefore, there is no integer `x` in the specified range such that `x & (x + 1)` equals 0. This holds true for all possible values of `x` within the given range, making the function return `False` in every case.
