The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6. It iterates up to 40 times, performing a series of operations on `x` based on the value of `count`. Specifically, if `count` is even, it repeatedly finds the highest set bit in `x` and clears it using bitwise operations until no more bits can be cleared. If `count` is odd, it simply increments `x` by 1. After 40 iterations, regardless of the intermediate states of `x`, the function returns a tuple containing the integer `count` with a value of 40 and a list `operations` that records the indices of the bits cleared during the even iterations. The final state of `x` will either be 0 or an odd number within the specified range.
