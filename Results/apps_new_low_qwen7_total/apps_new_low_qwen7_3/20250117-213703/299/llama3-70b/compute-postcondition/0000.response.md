The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial states of `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). After executing this line of code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the user's input.

Since the actual input values are not provided, the most precise answer in terms of the variables involved would be:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user, ensuring they are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\)**.
