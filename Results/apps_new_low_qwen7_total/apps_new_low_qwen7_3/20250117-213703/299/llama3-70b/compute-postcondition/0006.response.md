The function `func` accepts no parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle inputs `n` and `k` where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), but since these parameters are not passed to the function, they are not part of the function's parameter list.

Given the output cases are not directly tied to any function parameters (since the function does not take any parameters), the function likely uses predefined or passed values internally to determine its return value based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, and based on predefined or passed values of `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), it returns a value determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
