The code simply prints 'NO' to the console, which does not affect the values of the variables `n` and `k`. The condition \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\) also remains true since printing does not alter the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), and \((n - 1) // k \leq n // k\); `k` is a positive integer**
