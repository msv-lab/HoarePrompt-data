The code `print('YES')` does not change the values of any variables. It only prints 'YES' to the console. The precondition that \( (n - 1) // k \) is greater than \( n // k \) remains true after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\), and \((n - 1) // k > n // k\); printed 'YES'**
