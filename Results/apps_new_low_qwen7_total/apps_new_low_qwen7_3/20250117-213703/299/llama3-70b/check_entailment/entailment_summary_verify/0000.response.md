### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary step by step.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The game involves drawing \(n\) sticks and taking turns crossing out exactly \(k\) sticks per turn.
- Sasha moves first.
- Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
- The goal is to determine the outcome of the game based on the inputs \(n\) and \(k\).

#### Program Code Analysis:
- The program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from user input.
- It checks if \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\).
- If the condition is true, it prints 'YES', indicating Sasha wins; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Function Summary:
- The function compares \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\).
- If \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\), Sasha wins; otherwise, he loses.
- This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the number of moves Sasha can make being strictly greater than Lena's.

#### Edge Case Consideration:
- When \(n = k\):
  - Both \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) are 0, resulting in 'NO'.
  - However, in this case, Sasha still wins because he gets to make the first move, and Lena cannot make a move after Sasha's first move, meaning Sasha makes 1 move while Lena makes 0 moves. This should be 'YES'.

#### Correct Logic:
- Sasha wins if the number of moves he can make (starting first) is strictly greater than the number of moves Lena can make.
- The correct condition should be \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\).

#### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n // k) > ((n - 1) // k):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect because it fails to handle the case where \(n\) is exactly divisible by \(k\). The correct logic should compare \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\).

However, based on the function summary provided, the summary itself correctly describes the intended logic of comparing these floor divisions to determine the winner.

Since the original assessment correctly pointed out the flaw in the program and suggested the correct logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
