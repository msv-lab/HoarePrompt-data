### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - The game involves taking turns removing `k` sticks each time.
   - Sasha makes the first move, and they alternate turns.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` checks whether Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
   - This condition is based on the idea that Sasha can make an extra move if `(n - 1)` divided by `k` is greater than `n` divided by `k`.
   - However, this condition is not fully accurate. A more straightforward way to determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves is to check if `n % k` is non-zero.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n % k == 0`, both players would make an equal number of moves.
   - If `n % k != 0`, Sasha would make one more move than Lena.
   - The original condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` simplifies to checking if `n % k != 0` in most cases, but it has a flaw when `n` is very close to a multiple of `k`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The original condition is an approximation and might fail in edge cases where `n` is just slightly larger than a multiple of `k`. For example, if `n = 2k + 1`, the original condition would be incorrect because `(2k + 1 - 1) // k = 2` and `2k // k = 2`, leading to the same number of moves for both players.

### Correct Solution:
The correct logic should be:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k != 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is not entirely correct due to the edge cases it fails to handle properly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out the flaw in the condition check.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
