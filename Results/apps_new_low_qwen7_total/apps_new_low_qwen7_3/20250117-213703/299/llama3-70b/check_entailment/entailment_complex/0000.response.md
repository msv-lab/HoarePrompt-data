Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins the game. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the input, ensuring \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\).

2. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena. Each player takes turns removing exactly \(k\) sticks, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Game Analysis**:
   - Sasha moves first.
   - After Sasha's first move, \(n - k\) sticks remain.
   - Each subsequent turn reduces the number of sticks by \(k\).
   - Sasha wins if the number of Sasha's moves (which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor + 1\)) is greater than the number of Lena's moves (\(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\)).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) is used to check if Sasha can make one more move than Lena.
   - This condition holds true if and only if \(n\) is not divisible by \(k\), because:
     - When \(n\) is divisible by \(k\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\).
     - When \(n\) is not divisible by \(k\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor < \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(n = k\), both conditions are equal, and Sasha does not win.
   - If \(n\) is a multiple of \(k\), the condition does not hold, and Sasha does not win.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha wins the game under the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
