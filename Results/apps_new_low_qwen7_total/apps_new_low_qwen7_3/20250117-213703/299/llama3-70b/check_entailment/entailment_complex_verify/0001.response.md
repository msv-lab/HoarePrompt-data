### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the original solution and the annotated code with a more detailed analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena.
   - Sasha makes the first move, and they alternate turns.
   - Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is used to determine if Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
   - This condition checks whether the integer division of `(n - 1)` by `k` is greater than the integer division of `n` by `k`.
   - This is a mathematical way to determine if Sasha can make one more move than Lena.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n % k == 0`, both players would make an equal number of moves.
   - When `n % k != 0`, Sasha would make one more move than Lena.
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` correctly identifies these scenarios:
     - If `n` is not divisible by `k`, Sasha can make one more move.
     - If `n` is divisible by `k`, both players make an equal number of moves.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided solution uses the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` to determine the outcome.
   - This condition correctly captures the scenario where Sasha can make one more move than Lena.
   - The logic in the original assessment is flawed because it suggests that the condition is not entirely correct, but it actually is a valid approach to solving the problem.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Correct Condition**:
  - If `n % k == 0`, both players make an equal number of moves.
  - If `n % k != 0`, Sasha can make one more move than Lena.
  - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is equivalent to checking if `n % k != 0`.

### Correct Solution:
The provided solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
is indeed correct. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` correctly identifies the scenarios where Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate, and the provided solution is correct.
