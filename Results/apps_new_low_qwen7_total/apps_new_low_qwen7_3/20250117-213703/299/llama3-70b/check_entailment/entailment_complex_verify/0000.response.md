### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its behavior based on the problem statement and the annotated code.

#### Problem Statement and Requirements:
- Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from either end of `n` sticks.
- Sasha moves first.
- Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
- The program should determine the winner based on the input values of `n` and `k`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. Compares the results of `(n - 1) // k` and `n // k`.
3. If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it prints 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Understanding the Floor Division Comparison:**
   - The expression `(n - 1) // k` gives the number of complete moves Sasha can make if he starts by taking the last possible move.
   - The expression `n // k` gives the number of complete moves Sasha can make if he takes the first possible move.
   - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it implies that Sasha can make one more move than Lena, meaning Sasha can end the game with a move, thus winning.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n` is exactly divisible by `k`, both expressions will give the same result, leading to 'NO'.
   - This aligns with the logic that Sasha cannot make strictly more moves than Lena in this case.

#### Example Evaluations:
- **Example 1:** `n = 10`, `k = 5`
  - Sasha takes the first move: `(10 - 1) // 5 = 1` and `10 // 5 = 2`.
  - Sasha can make 1 move, Lena can make 1 move. They make the same number of moves, so Sasha does not win.
  - Correct Output: 'NO'

- **Example 2:** `n = 1`, `k = 1`
  - Sasha takes the first move: `(1 - 1) // 1 = 0` and `1 // 1 = 1`.
  - Sasha can make 0 moves, Lena can make 0 moves. They make the same number of moves, so Sasha does not win.
  - Correct Output: 'NO'

- **Example 3:** `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - Sasha takes the first move: `(10 - 1) // 4 = 2` and `10 // 4 = 2`.
  - Sasha can make 2 moves, but since they can only take complete moves, Sasha and Lena can each make 2 moves. Thus, Sasha does not win.
  - Correct Output: 'NO'

- **Example 4:** `n = 9`, `k = 3`
  - Sasha takes the first move: `(9 - 1) // 3 = 2` and `9 // 3 = 3`.
  - Sasha can make 2 moves, and Lena can make 2 moves, but Sasha can make one more move after Lena's move. Thus, Sasha wins.
  - Correct Output: 'YES'

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena based on the given logic. The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case when `n` is exactly divisible by `k`, but this is actually handled correctly by the logic provided. The program accurately determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
