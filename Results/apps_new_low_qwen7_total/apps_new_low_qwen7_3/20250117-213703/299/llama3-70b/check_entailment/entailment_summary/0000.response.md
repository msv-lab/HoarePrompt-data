Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program aims to decide whether Sasha will win the game based on the initial number of sticks \( n \) and the number of sticks \( k \) that can be removed in each turn.

### Analysis:

1. **Game Logic**:
   - Sasha makes the first move.
   - Players take turns removing exactly \( k \) sticks from either the left or the right.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Sasha to make more moves than Lena, he must be able to complete an odd number of moves.
   - This means \( n - 1 \) must be divisible by \( k \) an even number of times (including zero).

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program uses the condition \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\).
   - This condition checks if the difference in the number of moves between Sasha and Lena is greater than zero.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( n = k \): Both \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) are 0, resulting in a 'NO' output, which is correct.
   - When \( n \) is slightly more than \( k \): \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) is 0 and \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\) is 1, resulting in a 'NO' output, which is incorrect. Sasha should win in this case.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - Instead of comparing the differences, the correct condition should check if \((n - 1) \mod k\) is 0 and \((n - 1) / k\) is odd.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. The provided solution does not account for the correct condition where Sasha needs to make an odd number of moves.

Correctness: **False**
