Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is exactly divisible by `k`. In such a case, both Sasha and Lena can make an equal number of moves, resulting in Sasha making the same number of moves as Lena, which means Sasha does not win. For example, if the input is `10 5`, the program will output 'NO' because `(n - 1) // k` and `n // k` both evaluate to 2, indicating that Sasha and Lena can make the same number of moves. However, Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena, which is not accounted for in the current logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
