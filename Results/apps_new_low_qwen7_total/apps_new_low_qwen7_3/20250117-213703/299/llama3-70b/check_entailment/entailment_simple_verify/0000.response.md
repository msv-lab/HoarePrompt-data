### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem statement and the examples given.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena.
- Sasha goes first and each player removes exactly `k` sticks per turn.
- The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
- Sasha wins if he makes more moves than Lena.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
- It checks if \((n - 1) // k > n // k\).
- If true, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Annotated Code:
- The initial state assumes \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\).
- The if-else block checks if \((n - 1) // k\) is greater than \(n // k\).
- The logic seems to imply that if Sasha can potentially make more moves than Lena, he should win.

#### Example Analysis:
- For `1 1`: Sasha removes 1 stick, leaving none for Lena. Sasha wins, so output is 'YES'.
- For `10 4`: Sasha removes 4 sticks, leaving 6. Lena removes 4 sticks, leaving 2. Sasha cannot make another move, so they make equal moves, resulting in output 'NO'.

#### Critical Check:
- The critical issue lies in the condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\). This condition implies that Sasha can make more moves if he starts with a position where the number of remaining moves is greater by at least 1 when he removes `k` sticks compared to Lena starting with the same position.
- However, this condition does not correctly account for the fact that Sasha wins if he can make strictly more moves than Lena.

#### Correctness Verification:
- Consider the example `10 5`:
  - \(n = 10\), \(k = 5\).
  - \((10 - 1) // 5 = 1\) and \(10 // 5 = 2\).
  - According to the program, since \(1 \leq 2\), it prints 'NO', which is incorrect because Sasha can make one move and leave 5 sticks, allowing Lena to make one move, but Sasha can still make one more move, thus winning.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena. The condition \((n - 1) // k > n // k\) does not fully capture the scenario where Sasha can win by making one more move than Lena.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
