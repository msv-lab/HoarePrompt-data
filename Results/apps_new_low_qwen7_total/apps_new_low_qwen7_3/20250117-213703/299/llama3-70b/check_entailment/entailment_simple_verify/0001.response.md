### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the original solution and the proposed correct solution with the provided annotations.

#### Original Solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Proposed Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k != 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

From the annotations and the provided reasoning, the original assessment correctly identifies that the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not entirely correct. Instead, the simpler and more accurate condition is `n % k != 0`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - `(n - 1) // k > n // k`: This condition checks if the integer division of `(n - 1)` by `k` is greater than the integer division of `n` by `k`.
   - `n % k != 0`: This condition checks if `n` is not divisible by `k` without a remainder.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If `n` is not divisible by `k`, Sasha can make the last move and win.
   - If `n` is divisible by `k`, both Sasha and Lena will make an equal number of moves, resulting in a tie.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n % k != 0`, Sasha can make one more move than Lena.
   - When `n % k == 0`, both Sasha and Lena will make an equal number of moves.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The condition `n % k != 0` directly reflects the scenario where Sasha can make one more move than Lena.
   - The original condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is a more complex way to derive the same result but can fail in certain edge cases, as pointed out in the original assessment.

Since the proposed correct solution `if n % k != 0` accurately reflects the logic and handles all edge cases, the original solution is indeed incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not a reliable way to determine if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena. The correct condition is `n % k != 0`.
