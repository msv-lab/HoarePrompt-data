You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored at them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with friends.

Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he shares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that the players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in each turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there are less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result of the game before playing, you are to help him.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k ≤ n) — the number of sticks drawn by Sasha and the number k — the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.


-----Output-----

If Sasha wins, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
YES

Input
10 4

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't make a move, and Sasha wins.

In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks, then Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left. Sasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha doesn't win.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - 1) // k > n // k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(k \leq n\). If \((n - 1) // k > n // k\), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not print anything specific but maintains the same preconditions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand who will have the last move.
   - Sasha makes the first move, and they alternate turns.
   - Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` checks whether Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
   - Let's break down this condition:
     - `(n - 1) // k` calculates the maximum number of full moves Sasha can make.
     - `n // k` calculates the maximum number of full moves Lena can make.
     - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it means Sasha can make one more move than Lena.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n % k == 0`, both players would make an equal number of moves.
   - If `n % k != 0`, Sasha would make one more move than Lena.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not entirely correct for determining if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena.
   - A simpler and more accurate way to check this would be to see if `n % k` is non-zero, which means Sasha can make one more move.

### Correct Solution:
The correct logic should be:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k != 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is not entirely correct. However, if we consider the condition as a close approximation, it might work in most cases but fails in specific edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
