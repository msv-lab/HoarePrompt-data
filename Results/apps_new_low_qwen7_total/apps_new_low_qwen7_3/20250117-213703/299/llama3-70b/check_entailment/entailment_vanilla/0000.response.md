### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand who will have the last move.
   - Sasha makes the first move, and they alternate turns.
   - Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
   - The game ends when fewer than `k` sticks remain.
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` checks whether Sasha can make more moves than Lena.
   - Let's break down this condition:
     - `(n - 1) // k` calculates the maximum number of full moves Sasha can make.
     - `n // k` calculates the maximum number of full moves Lena can make.
     - If `(n - 1) // k > n // k`, it means Sasha can make one more move than Lena.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n % k == 0`, both players would make an equal number of moves.
   - If `n % k != 0`, Sasha would make one more move than Lena.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is not entirely correct for determining if Sasha can make strictly more moves than Lena.
   - A simpler and more accurate way to check this would be to see if `n % k` is non-zero, which means Sasha can make one more move.

### Correct Solution:
The correct logic should be:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % k != 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is not entirely correct. However, if we consider the condition as a close approximation, it might work in most cases but fails in specific edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
