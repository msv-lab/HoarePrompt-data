Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic inside the `if-else` block accurately reflects the game's rules and determines the winner based on the conditions provided.

### Game Rules Recap:
1. Players take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from either end.
2. Sasha moves first.
3. The player who makes the last move wins.
4. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
- The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- It then checks if the condition `((n - 1) // k > n // k)` holds true.
- If the condition is true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - Each player makes a move by crossing out `k` sticks.
   - The total number of moves is determined by how many times `k` fits into `n`.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
   - Since Sasha moves first, the number of moves can be calculated as follows:
     - Number of moves Sasha can make: `n // k`
     - Number of moves Lena can make: `(n - k) // k`

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `((n - 1) // k > n // k)` checks if the number of moves Sasha can make is greater than the number of moves Lena can make.
   - This condition is not directly related to the actual winning condition of making strictly more moves than the opponent.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `1 1`:
  - Sasha can make 1 move, and Lena cannot make any move. Hence, Sasha wins.
  - The program should print "YES", which it does correctly.

- For the input `10 4`:
  - Sasha can make 2 moves (since `10 // 4 = 2`), and Lena can make 1 move (since `(10 - 4) // 4 = 1`). Sasha makes more moves, so he wins.
  - The program should print "NO", which it does incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The given condition `((n - 1) // k > n // k)` is not the correct way to determine if Sasha makes strictly more moves than Lena. Instead, the correct approach would be to compare the integer division results directly without subtracting 1 from `n`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
