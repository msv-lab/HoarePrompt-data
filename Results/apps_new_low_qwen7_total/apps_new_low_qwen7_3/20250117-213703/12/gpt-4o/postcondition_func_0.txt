The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are within the range [1, 10^9]. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then divides this product by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function returns the result of this division. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the range constraints already provided. The function does not modify any external state and relies on the built-in `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.
