Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are within the range [1, 10^9]. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then divides this product by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function returns the result of this division. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the range constraints already provided. The function does not modify any external state and relies on the built-in `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function based on the provided code, including the calculation and return value, while noting that the annotations do not indicate any additional requirements or edge cases beyond the standard mathematical operation described.
