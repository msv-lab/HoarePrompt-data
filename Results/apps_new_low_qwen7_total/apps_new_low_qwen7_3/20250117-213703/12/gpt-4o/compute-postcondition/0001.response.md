The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, and they represent indices with constraints 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The function returns the product of `x` and `y` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, and return the product of `x` and `y` divided by their gcd.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, returns the product of x and y divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).**
