Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads five integers from the input, which are assigned to variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
2. **Tile Count Calculation**:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: This correctly calculates the number of tiles whose index is divisible by `a` and hence should be painted red.
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: This correctly calculates the number of tiles whose index is divisible by `b` and hence should be painted blue.
   - `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)`: This calculates the number of tiles whose index is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, as it computes `x * y // gcd(x, y)`. Therefore, this calculation is correct.
3. **Chocolates Calculation**:
   - `max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)`: This correctly calculates the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get. The term `both_tiles * min(p, q)` is subtracted to avoid double-counting the chocolates for tiles that are painted both red and blue.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated value of `max_chocolates`.

The provided function `func_1(x, y)` correctly implements the calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\gcd(x, y)} \).

Given that all parts of the program align with the problem statement and the calculations are logically sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
