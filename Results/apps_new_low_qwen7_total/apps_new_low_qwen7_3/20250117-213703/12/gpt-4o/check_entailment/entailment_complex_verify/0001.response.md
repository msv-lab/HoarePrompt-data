### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles based on their indices.
   - Tiles with indices divisible by `a` are painted red, and those divisible by `b` are painted blue.
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (i.e., `lcm(a, b)`) can be painted either red or blue, but we aim to maximize the number of chocolates, so we need to decide which color gives more chocolates.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of five integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
   - Output is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, stored in a 64-bit integer type.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: Number of tiles painted red.
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Number of tiles painted blue.
   - `both_tiles = n // lcm(a, b)`: Number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue.
   - The formula to calculate the maximum chocolates is:
     \[
     \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q))
     \]
   - This ensures that we count the overlapping tiles only once, subtracting the minimum chocolates between red and blue for those tiles.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly uses the formula and the function to compute the LCM.
   - The final result is calculated using the provided values and printed as a 64-bit integer.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, which are integers within the specified range. The calculation of `both_tiles` is correct because it accounts for the overlap between red and blue tiles.

6. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations indicate that `func_1` returns the product of `x` and `y` divided by their greatest common divisor, which correctly calculates the LCM.
   - The overall logic of the program matches the reasoning in the original assessment, ensuring that the maximum chocolates are computed accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get based on the problem statement. The annotations support the validity of the code and the original assessment.
