You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Annotated Code: 
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the indices a and b respectively, and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. p and q are also integers representing the number of chocolates Joty gets for painting a tile red and blue respectively, and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    #The program returns the product of x and y divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are within the range [1, 10^9]. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then divides this product by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function returns the result of this division. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the range constraints already provided. The function does not modify any external state and relies on the built-in `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in calculating the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` should be used instead of hardcoding the calculation inside the main logic. However, the current implementation of `func_1(a, b)` uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem requires counting the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, not their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The correct LCM can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

However, the current implementation directly divides `a * b` by `gcd(a, b)`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be:

1. Calculate the GCD of `a` and `b`.
2. Use the formula to calculate the LCM.
3. Subtract the number of tiles painted both colors once (since they are counted twice).

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd

(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate GCD of a and b
gcd_ab = gcd(a, b)

# Calculate LCM of a and b
lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd_ab

# Calculate the number of tiles painted red, blue, and both
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // lcm_ab

# Calculate the maximum number of chocolates
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)

print(max_chocolates)
```

This corrected code ensures that the number of tiles painted both colors is accurately calculated, leading to the correct maximum number of chocolates.
