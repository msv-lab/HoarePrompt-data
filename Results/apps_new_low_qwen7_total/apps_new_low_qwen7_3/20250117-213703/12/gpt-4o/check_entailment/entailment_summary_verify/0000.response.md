Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that there is a logical error in the program regarding the calculation of the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` incorrectly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) as the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is mathematically incorrect. Instead, the LCM should be calculated as:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

However, the current implementation directly uses this formula, which is not necessarily wrong but could be seen as redundant since the GCD is computed separately and then used to calculate the LCM. Nevertheless, the key issue is that the `func_1(a, b)` function should not be used to calculate the LCM if it is not correctly implemented.

The original assessment suggests that the LCM should be calculated independently and correctly, which is true. However, the current implementation of `func_1(a, b)` is actually correct in its purpose, just not clearly stated as such. The function correctly computes the LCM using the standard formula.

The main issue lies in the fact that the `func_1(a, b)` function is used in the context where it is supposed to calculate the LCM, but the original code does not correctly reflect this. The correct approach would be to calculate the GCD and then use it to find the LCM. But since `func_1(a, b)` is already doing the correct computation, the overall logic of the program is still valid.

Therefore, the original assessment is slightly off in its criticism, as the function `func_1(a, b)` is indeed performing the correct calculation, just not in a clear manner. The program logic, when considering the correct use of `func_1(a, b)`, is correct.

Final: **True**
