You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Joty has got a task to do. She has a line of n tiles indexed from 1 to n. She has to paint them in a strange pattern.

An unpainted tile should be painted Red if it's index is divisible by a and an unpainted tile should be painted Blue if it's index is divisible by b. So the tile with the number divisible by a and b can be either painted Red or Blue.

After her painting is done, she will get p chocolates for each tile that is painted Red and q chocolates for each tile that is painted Blue.

Note that she can paint tiles in any order she wants.

Given the required information, find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.


-----Input-----

The only line contains five integers n, a, b, p and q (1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer s — the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get.

Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3 12 15

Output
39

Input
20 2 3 3 5

Output
51

- Program:
(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)
print(max_chocolates)

def func_1(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are within the range [1, 10^9]. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then divides this product by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function returns the result of this division. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the range constraints already provided. The function does not modify any external state and relies on the built-in `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves determining the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles based on their indices.
   - Tiles with indices divisible by `a` are painted red, and those divisible by `b` are painted blue.
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (i.e., `lcm(a, b)`) can be painted either red or blue, but we aim to maximize the number of chocolates, so we need to decide which color gives more chocolates.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of five integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
   - Output is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, stored in a 64-bit integer type.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: Number of tiles painted red.
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Number of tiles painted blue.
   - `both_tiles = n // lcm(a, b)`: Number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue.
   - The formula to calculate the maximum chocolates is:
     \[
     \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q))
     \]
   - This ensures that we count the overlapping tiles only once, subtracting the minimum chocolates between red and blue for those tiles.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly uses the formula and the function to compute the LCM.
   - The final result is calculated using the provided values and printed as a 64-bit integer.

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get based on the problem statement.
