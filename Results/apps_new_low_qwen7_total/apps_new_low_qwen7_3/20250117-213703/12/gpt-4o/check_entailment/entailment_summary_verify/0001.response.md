### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles based on their indices. Tiles with indices divisible by `a` are painted red, and those divisible by `b` are painted blue. Overlapping tiles can be painted either color, but we aim to maximize the number of chocolates.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of five integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
   - Output is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, stored in a 64-bit integer type.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: Number of tiles painted red.
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Number of tiles painted blue.
   - `both_tiles = n // lcm(a, b)`: Number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue.
   - The formula to calculate the maximum chocolates is:
     \[
     \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q))
     \]
   - This ensures that we count the overlapping tiles only once, subtracting the minimum chocolates between red and blue for those tiles.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly uses the formula and the function to compute the LCM.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to calculate `both_tiles`. The formula `both_tiles = n // func_1(a, b)` assumes that `func_1(a, b)` directly computes the LCM, which is true because `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. But, the key point here is the integer division `n // func_1(a, b)` which might not always give the exact count of tiles divisible by the LCM due to precision issues in integer division, especially when `n` is very large.

To ensure the correct calculation, the division `n // func_1(a, b)` should be handled carefully, considering the precision of integer division. A better approach would be to use floating-point arithmetic to compute the exact count of tiles divisible by the LCM and then convert it back to an integer.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the current implementation, the integer division `n // func_1(a, b)` might introduce errors for very large values of `n`, leading to an incorrect count of tiles divisible by the LCM.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The original assessment is slightly inaccurate because the integer division `n // func_1(a, b)` might not always yield the correct count of tiles divisible by the LCM, especially for large values of `n`. To ensure accuracy, a more precise method should be used to handle the division, such as using floating-point arithmetic and then converting back to an integer.
