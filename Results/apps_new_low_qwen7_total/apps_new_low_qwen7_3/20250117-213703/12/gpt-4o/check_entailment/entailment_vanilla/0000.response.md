### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves determining the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles based on their indices.
   - Tiles with indices divisible by `a` are painted red, and those divisible by `b` are painted blue.
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` (i.e., `lcm(a, b)`) can be painted either red or blue, but we aim to maximize the number of chocolates, so we need to decide which color gives more chocolates.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of five integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
   - Output is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, stored in a 64-bit integer type.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `red_tiles = n // a`: Number of tiles painted red.
   - `blue_tiles = n // b`: Number of tiles painted blue.
   - `both_tiles = n // lcm(a, b)`: Number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue.
   - The formula to calculate the maximum chocolates is:
     \[
     \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q))
     \]
   - This ensures that we count the overlapping tiles only once, subtracting the minimum chocolates between red and blue for those tiles.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly uses the formula and the function to compute the LCM.
   - The final result is calculated using the provided values and printed as a 64-bit integer.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get based on the problem statement.
