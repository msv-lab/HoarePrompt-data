Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in calculating the number of tiles that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(a, b)` should be used instead of hardcoding the calculation inside the main logic. However, the current implementation of `func_1(a, b)` uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem requires counting the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, not their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The correct LCM can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

However, the current implementation directly divides `a * b` by `gcd(a, b)`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be:

1. Calculate the GCD of `a` and `b`.
2. Use the formula to calculate the LCM.
3. Subtract the number of tiles painted both colors once (since they are counted twice).

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd

(n, a, b, p, q) = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate GCD of a and b
gcd_ab = gcd(a, b)

# Calculate LCM of a and b
lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd_ab

# Calculate the number of tiles painted red, blue, and both
red_tiles = n // a
blue_tiles = n // b
both_tiles = n // lcm_ab

# Calculate the maximum number of chocolates
max_chocolates = red_tiles * p + blue_tiles * q - both_tiles * min(p, q)

print(max_chocolates)
```

This corrected code ensures that the number of tiles painted both colors is accurately calculated, leading to the correct maximum number of chocolates.
