Reasoning:
The program aims to calculate the maximum number of chocolates Joty can obtain by painting tiles according to certain rules. The key steps involve:

1. Calculating the number of tiles that are multiples of `a` (red tiles).
2. Calculating the number of tiles that are multiples of `b` (blue tiles).
3. Calculating the number of tiles that are multiples of both `a` and `b` (tiles that can be either red or blue).

The formula used to compute the maximum number of chocolates is:
\[ \text{max\_chocolates} = \text{red\_tiles} \times p + \text{blue\_tiles} \times q - \text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q) \]

This formula accounts for the fact that tiles which are multiples of both `a` and `b` (i.e., multiples of `lcm(a, b)` or `a*b/gcd(a, b)`) are counted twice in the initial sum of `red_tiles * p` and `blue_tiles * q`. Hence, we subtract `both_tiles * min(p, q)` to avoid double-counting.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the relationship \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \), where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
