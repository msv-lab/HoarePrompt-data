### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves calculating the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get by painting tiles based on their indices.
   - Tiles with indices divisible by `a` are painted red, and those divisible by `b` are painted blue.
   - Tiles divisible by both `a` and `b` can be painted either red or blue, and we need to maximize the number of chocolates.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of five integers: `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q`.
   - Output is the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get, stored in a 64-bit integer type.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The annotated code correctly initializes variables to count the number of red, blue, and both tiles.
   - The calculation for the maximum number of chocolates uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_chocolates} = (\text{red\_tiles} \times p) + (\text{blue\_tiles} \times q) - (\text{both\_tiles} \times \min(p, q))
     \]
   - This formula ensures that overlapping tiles (divisible by both `a` and `b`) are not double-counted, and the minimum chocolates between the two colors are considered for these tiles.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `both_tiles` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM is correctly computed as:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly computes the LCM using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The number of tiles that can be painted either red or blue (`both_tiles`) is correctly calculated using this LCM.
   - The final result is correctly calculated and printed as a 64-bit integer.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations match the actual behavior of the code, confirming that the logic is sound.
   - The state of the program at each key point is accurately described, supporting the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of chocolates Joty can get based on the problem statement.

**Final: True**
