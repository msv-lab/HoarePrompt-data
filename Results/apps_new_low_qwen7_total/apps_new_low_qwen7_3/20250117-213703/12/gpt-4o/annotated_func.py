#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the indices a and b respectively, and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. p and q are also integers representing the number of chocolates Joty gets for painting a tile red and blue respectively, and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    #The program returns the product of x and y divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are within the range [1, 10^9]. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then divides this product by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The function returns the result of this division. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the range constraints already provided. The function does not modify any external state and relies on the built-in `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.
