Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\) and \(n \geq k\), and `min_sum` is the value of \(k * (k + 1) // 2\). The condition `min_sum > n` is false, which means \(n\) is at least as large as or larger than `min_sum`.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
d = n // min_sum
remainder = n - d * min_sum
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Calculate `d`:**
   - `d = n // min_sum` divides `n` by `min_sum` using integer division. This gives the largest integer `d` such that `d * min_sum <= n`.
   
2. **Calculate `remainder`:**
   - `remainder = n - d * min_sum` computes the remainder when `n` is divided by `min_sum`. This is effectively `n % min_sum`.

3. **Construct `sequence`:**
   - `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]` creates a list where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. This results in a list of `k` elements: `[d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]`.

### Final Output State

- `n` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `k` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `min_sum` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `d` is set to `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is set to `n - d * min_sum`.
- `sequence` is a list of length `k` where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`.

Therefore, the final state after executing the given code block is:

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, min_sum is an integer, d is n // min_sum, remainder is n - d * min_sum, sequence is [d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]**
