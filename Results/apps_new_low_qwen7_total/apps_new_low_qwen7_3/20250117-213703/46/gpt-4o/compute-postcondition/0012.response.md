Postcondition: ***`i` is \( k - 2 \), sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-2] plus 1, and remainder is -1. If the condition `remainder == 0` evaluates to true, the most internal loop or match case is broken out of. If the condition does not evaluate to true, no changes occur to the variables.***
