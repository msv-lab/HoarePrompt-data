Initial State: `i` is `k - 1`, and `remainder` is 0.

Code Block:
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line increments the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list by 1.
2. The second line decreases the value of `remainder` by 1.

Since `remainder` is initially 0, the subtraction operation will result in `remainder` being set to -1. However, since the value of `remainder` is 0 in the initial state and the code subtracts 1 from it, `remainder` will become -1. But the problem states that if `remainder` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which is not applicable here because the code continues to execute.

Final State:
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1
- `remainder` is -1

Output State: **i is k - 1, sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-1] plus 1, remainder is -1**
