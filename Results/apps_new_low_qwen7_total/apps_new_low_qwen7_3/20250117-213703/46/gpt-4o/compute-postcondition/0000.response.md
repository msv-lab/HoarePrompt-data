The code assigns the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2` to the variable `min_sum`. This is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k; `min_sum` is the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k; `min_sum` is the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
