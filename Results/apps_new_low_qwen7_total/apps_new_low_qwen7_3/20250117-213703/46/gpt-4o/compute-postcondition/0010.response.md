The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-1]` plus 1, and `remainder` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1 and become `k - 2`.

State: **`i` is \( k - 2 \), sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-2] plus 1, remainder is -1**
