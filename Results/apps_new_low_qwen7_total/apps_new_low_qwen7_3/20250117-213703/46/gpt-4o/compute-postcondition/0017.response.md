Initial State: `i` is `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2, and `remainder` is `-2`.

After executing the code block:
1. The first line `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value of `sequence[i]` by 1. Since `sequence[i]` was originally the value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2, after this line, `sequence[i]` becomes the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 3.
2. The second line `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. Since `remainder` was initially `-2`, after this line, `remainder` becomes `-3`.

No other variables are affected.

Output State: **i is k - 3, sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-2] plus 3, and remainder is -3**
