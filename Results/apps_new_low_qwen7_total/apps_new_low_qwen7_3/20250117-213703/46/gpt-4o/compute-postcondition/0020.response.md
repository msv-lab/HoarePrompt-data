The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k. 

Case_1: If the condition for the sequence update is not met, the function returns -1.

Case_2: If the condition for the sequence update is met, the function returns a `sequence` which contains the updated value of `sequence[i]` where `i = k - remainder` and `sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1)` with `remainder = 0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and either return -1 if the conditions are not met or return a modified sequence based on the specified conditions.
