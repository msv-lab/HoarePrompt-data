Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over `i` from `k-1` down to `0`. For each iteration, it checks if `remainder` is zero. If not, it increments `sequence[i]` by 1 and decreases `remainder` by 1.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `n`, `min_sum`, and `d` remain constant throughout the loop because they are not modified within the loop.
  - `sequence` is modified in place, but its length (`k`) remains constant.
- **Variables Changing During the Loop**:
  - `remainder` decreases by 1 in each iteration unless it is already zero.
  - `sequence[i]` increases by 1 for each decrement of `remainder`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop continues as long as `remainder` is not zero.
- In each iteration, `sequence[i]` is incremented, and `remainder` is decremented.
- The loop terminates when `remainder` reaches zero.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided output states, we can infer:
- After 1 iteration: `i = k - 1`, `sequence[k-1]` is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is `-1`.
- After 2 iterations: `i = k - 2`, `sequence[k-2]` is incremented by 2, and `remainder` is `-2`.
- After 3 iterations: `i = k - 3`, `sequence[k-3]` is incremented by 3, and `remainder` is `-3`.

This pattern suggests that after `x` iterations, `i = k - x`, `sequence[k-x]` is incremented by `x + 1`, and `remainder` is `-x`.

To find the final state, we need to determine how many iterations the loop will execute. The loop will execute until `remainder` becomes zero.

Since `remainder` starts as `n - d * min_sum` and decreases by 1 per iteration, the number of iterations required is `remainder`.

### Final Calculation
- The loop will execute `remainder` times.
- After `remainder` iterations, `i` will be `k - remainder`.
- `sequence[i]` will be the original value of `sequence[k-remainder]` plus `(remainder + 1)`.
- `remainder` will be zero.

### Output State
Given the analysis, the final state after the loop completes will be:
- `i = k - remainder`
- `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-remainder]` plus `(remainder + 1)`
- `remainder = 0`

Output State: **i = k - remainder, sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1), remainder = 0.**
