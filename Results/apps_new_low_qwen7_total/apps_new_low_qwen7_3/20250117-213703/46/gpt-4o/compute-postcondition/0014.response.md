Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `k - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `k - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is `k - 2`
   - `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2
   - `remainder` is `-2`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is running in reverse order (`-1` step), the next value of `i` will be `k - 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `i` should be `k - 3` and `k - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from `k - 2` to `k - 3`.
   - `sequence[i]` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted, and no changes are mentioned.
   - `remainder` remains `-2` since there are no operations affecting it in the loop body.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2, `remainder` is `-2`**
