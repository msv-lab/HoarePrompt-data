To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `min_sum` is an integer
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`
- `sequence` is a list defined as `[d, 2*d, 3*d, ..., k*d]`

Loop:
```
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)` will iterate from `k-1` down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the specified range.

2. **Range Check:**
   - The first iteration will occur when `i = k - 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `k - 1` must be a valid index in the range.

3. **Validation of Range:**
   - Since `range(start, stop, step)` generates values starting from `start` and stops before `stop`, we need `k - 1` to be a non-negative value.
   - Hence, `k - 1` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Additional Constraints:**
   - We don't have additional constraints directly involving `i` other than ensuring it falls within the range.
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not affect the loop's first execution since they are not used in the loop itself.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The primary constraint for the loop to execute the first time is that `i` must be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the state for the loop head must ensure that `i` is set to `k - 1`.

State: **`i` is `k - 1`**
