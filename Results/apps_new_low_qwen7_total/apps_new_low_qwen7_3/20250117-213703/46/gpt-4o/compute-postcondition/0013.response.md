Initial State: `i` is \( k - 2 \), `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 1, and `remainder` is -1.
```
sequence[i] += 1
remainder -= 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value of `sequence[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is \( k - 2 \) and `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 1, the value of `sequence[i]` will now be the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2.
2. The second line `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. Given that `remainder` is initially -1, it will become -2 after this operation.

No changes occur to any other variables, and since the condition `remainder == 0` is false (as `remainder` is -2), no further actions are taken.

Final State:
- `i` remains \( k - 2 \)
- `sequence[i]` becomes the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2
- `remainder` becomes -2

Output State: **i is k - 2, sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-2] plus 2, remainder is -2**
