The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it simply breaks out of the innermost loop or match case. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( k - 2 \), sequence[i] is the original value of sequence[k-2] plus 1, remainder is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or match case.**
