The code `break` does not affect any variable values. It only breaks out of the current loop or conditional statement. Given that there is no loop or conditional statement in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2, `remainder` is `-2`**
