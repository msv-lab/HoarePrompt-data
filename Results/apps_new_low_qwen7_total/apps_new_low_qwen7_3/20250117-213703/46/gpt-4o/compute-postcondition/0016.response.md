Postcondition: ***`i` is `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is the original value of `sequence[k-2]` plus 2, and `remainder` is `-2`. Since the if condition `remainder == 0` is not met (as `remainder` is `-2`), the program does not enter the if part. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
