    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k; `min_sum` is the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The condition `min_sum > n` is false

    return sequence
    #`sequence` which contains the updated value of `sequence[i]` where `i = k - remainder` and `sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1)` with `remainder = 0`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\) and \(n \geq k\). It aims to determine if it is possible to create a sequence of length `k` where the sum of the sequence is exactly `n`. 

If the minimum sum required (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) exceeds `n`, the function returns `-1`.

Otherwise, the function calculates a divisor `d` and a remainder `remainder` from the division of `n` by `min_sum`. It then creates a sequence where each element is initially set to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`. The function then iteratively increments elements starting from the end of the sequence until the remainder is zero or the sequence is fully adjusted.

After these operations, the function returns the modified sequence where the last `remainder` elements have been incremented by `1`.

In summary, the function checks if a valid sequence can be formed and returns either `-1` if not possible or the modified sequence if possible.
