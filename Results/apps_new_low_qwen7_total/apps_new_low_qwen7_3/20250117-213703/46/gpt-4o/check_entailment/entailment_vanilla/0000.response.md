Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Minimum Sum Check**: It checks if the minimum possible sum (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) can be achieved with the given `n`. If not, it returns `-1`, which is correct because we cannot form a sequence with those constraints.
   - **Greatest Common Divisor Calculation**: It calculates the greatest common divisor (`d`) as `n // min_sum`. This is a reasonable approach to maximize the GCD since we need the largest possible GCD for the elements of the sequence.
   - **Initial Sequence Setup**: It initializes the sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which sets up an initial sequence where each term is `d * (i + 1)`.
   - **Adjustment for Remainder**: It iterates backward through the sequence to adjust the last few terms to account for the remainder, ensuring the sequence sums up to `n`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly address the requirements. It handles cases where the sequence cannot be formed and ensures the sequence is strictly increasing while maximizing the GCD.

Correctness: **True**
