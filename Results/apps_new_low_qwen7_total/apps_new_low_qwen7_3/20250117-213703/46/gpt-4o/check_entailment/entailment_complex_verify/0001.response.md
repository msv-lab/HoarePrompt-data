### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence. This is correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Minimum Sum Check**:
     - It checks if the minimum possible sum (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) can be achieved with the given `n`. If not, it returns `-1`. This check is necessary but might not cover all edge cases.
   - **Greatest Common Divisor Calculation**:
     - It calculates the greatest common divisor (`d`) as `n // min_sum`. This step is aimed at finding a common divisor for the sequence, but the calculation itself is not sufficient to ensure the GCD is maximized.
   - **Initial Sequence Setup**:
     - It initializes the sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which sets up an initial sequence where each term is `d * (i + 1)`. This setup assumes that the initial sequence is strictly increasing and tries to distribute the sum as evenly as possible.
   - **Adjustment for Remainder**:
     - It iterates backward through the sequence to adjust the last few terms to account for the remainder, ensuring the sequence sums up to `n`. This step ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and the sum is correct.

However, there are some issues with the logic:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle cases where `n` is very close to the minimum sum but still cannot be divided evenly. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the minimum sum is 10, but the sequence `[3, 3, 3, 1]` would not be valid since it is not strictly increasing.

- **GCD Maximization**:
  - The function calculates the GCD based on `d`, but it does not guarantee that the GCD of the sequence is maximized. For example, if `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the function returns `[2, 6]` with a GCD of 2, but the sequence `[4, 4]` also sums to 8 and has a GCD of 4.

- **Sequence Validation**:
  - The function does not explicitly validate that the sequence is strictly increasing after adjustments. For example, if `n = 15` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[5, 5, 5]` is valid but not strictly increasing.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

1. **Before Function Call**:
   - `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\) and \(n \geq k\).

2. **After Minimum Sum Check**:
   - If `min_sum > n`, the function returns `-1`. This is correct for invalid cases.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - `d = n // min_sum` calculates a divisor, but it does not guarantee the GCD is maximized.

4. **Initial Sequence Setup**:
   - `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]` initializes the sequence with the smallest possible strictly increasing values.

5. **Adjustment for Remainder**:
   - The loop adjusts the last few elements to account for the remainder. This ensures the sequence sums to `n` but does not necessarily maximize the GCD.

### Conclusion:

While the function attempts to find a sequence with the given constraints, it does not guarantee that the GCD is maximized or that the sequence is strictly increasing throughout the adjustments. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
