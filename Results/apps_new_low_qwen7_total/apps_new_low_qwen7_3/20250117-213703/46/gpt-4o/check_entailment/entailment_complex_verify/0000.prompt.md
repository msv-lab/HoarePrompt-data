You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n >= k.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k; `min_sum` is the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The condition `min_sum > n` is false
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = k - remainder, sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1), remainder = 0.
    return sequence
    #`sequence` which contains the updated value of `sequence[i]` where `i = k - remainder` and `sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1)` with `remainder = 0`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\) and \(n \geq k\). It aims to determine if it is possible to create a sequence of length `k` where the sum of the sequence is exactly `n`. 

If the minimum sum required (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) exceeds `n`, the function returns `-1`.

Otherwise, the function calculates a divisor `d` and a remainder `remainder` from the division of `n` by `min_sum`. It then creates a sequence where each element is initially set to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`. The function then iteratively increments elements starting from the end of the sequence until the remainder is zero or the sequence is fully adjusted.

After these operations, the function returns the modified sequence where the last `remainder` elements have been incremented by `1`.

In summary, the function checks if a valid sequence can be formed and returns either `-1` if not possible or the modified sequence if possible.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence needs to be maximized. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the GCD of the generated sequence is maximized. For instance, consider the input `n = 9` and `k = 3`. The expected output would be `1 3 5` because the sum is 9 and the GCD is 1, which is the maximum possible GCD for a strictly increasing sequence of three numbers that sum to 9. However, the current implementation might generate other sequences that do not maximize the GCD. This can be seen as the program does not fully meet the requirement to maximize the GCD of the sequence.
