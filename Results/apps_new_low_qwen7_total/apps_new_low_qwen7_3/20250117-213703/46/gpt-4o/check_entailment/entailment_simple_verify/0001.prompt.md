You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if min_sum > n:
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n >= k.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10 and n ≥ k; `min_sum` is the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The condition `min_sum > n` is false
    d = n // min_sum

remainder = n - d * min_sum

sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i = k - remainder, sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1), remainder = 0.
    return sequence
    #`sequence` which contains the updated value of `sequence[i]` where `i = k - remainder` and `sequence[i] = original value of sequence[k-remainder] + (remainder + 1)` with `remainder = 0`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Minimum Sum Check**: It checks if the minimum possible sum (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) can be achieved with the given `n`. If not, it returns `-1`, which is correct because we cannot form a sequence with those constraints.
   - **Greatest Common Divisor Calculation**: It calculates the greatest common divisor (`d`) as `n // min_sum`. This is a reasonable approach to maximize the GCD since we need the largest possible GCD for the elements of the sequence.
   - **Initial Sequence Setup**: It initializes the sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which sets up an initial sequence where each term is `d * (i + 1)`.
   - **Adjustment for Remainder**: It iterates backward through the sequence to adjust the last few terms to account for the remainder, ensuring the sequence sums up to `n`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly address the requirements. It handles cases where the sequence cannot be formed and ensures the sequence is strictly increasing while maximizing the GCD.
