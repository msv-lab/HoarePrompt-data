### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the given problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \) and \( k \) using `map(int, input().split())`. This part is correct.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence. This is the expected behavior.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Minimum Sum Check**:
     - The function calculates the minimum possible sum of the sequence as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this sum is greater than \( n \), it returns `-1`. This check is correct because if the minimum sum of the smallest possible sequence is greater than \( n \), it's impossible to form a sequence that sums to \( n \).
   
   - **Greatest Common Divisor Calculation**:
     - The function calculates the greatest common divisor (`d`) as `n // min_sum`. This step is correct for ensuring the sequence elements are maximally divisible by `d`.
   
   - **Initial Sequence Setup**:
     - The function initializes the sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`. This setup creates a sequence where each term is a multiple of `d` and is in strictly increasing order. This part is correct.
   
   - **Adjustment for Remainder**:
     - The function iterates backward through the sequence to adjust the last few terms to account for the remainder, ensuring the sequence sums up to \( n \). However, there is a subtle issue here. The adjustment logic only increments the last few terms by 1, but it doesn't ensure that the sequence remains strictly increasing. Consider the following example:
       - Suppose \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \). The initial sequence would be `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(4)] = [d, 2d, 3d, 4d]`. If the initial sum is less than 10, the remainder would be adjusted by incrementing the last few terms. But what if the initial sequence already exceeds 10? For instance, if \( d = 3 \), the initial sequence would be `[3, 6, 9, 12]`, which already exceeds 10. In such cases, the program would incorrectly handle the remainder without maintaining the strictly increasing property.

To illustrate, let's consider another example:
- If \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \), the initial sequence would be `[3, 6, 9, 12]`. Since the sum is already 30, the program would return `-1` because the sequence cannot be adjusted to sum to 10 while maintaining the strictly increasing property.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies when it's impossible to form a sequence (returning `-1` when the minimum sum is greater than \( n \)). However, the adjustment logic does not guarantee that the sequence remains strictly increasing if the initial sequence already exceeds \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct because it fails to ensure that the sequence remains strictly increasing if the initial sequence already exceeds \( n \).
