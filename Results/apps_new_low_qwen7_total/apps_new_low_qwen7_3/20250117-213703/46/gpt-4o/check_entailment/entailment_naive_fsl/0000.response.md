Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence needs to be maximized. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the GCD of the generated sequence is maximized. For instance, consider the input `n = 9` and `k = 3`. The expected output would be `1 3 5` because the sum is 9 and the GCD is 1, which is the maximum possible GCD for a strictly increasing sequence of three numbers that sum to 9. However, the current implementation might generate other sequences that do not maximize the GCD. This can be seen as the program does not fully meet the requirement to maximize the GCD of the sequence.
