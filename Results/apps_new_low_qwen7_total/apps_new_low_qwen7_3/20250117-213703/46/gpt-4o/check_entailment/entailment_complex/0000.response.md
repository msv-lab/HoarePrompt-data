Reasoning:

1. **Initial Validation**: The function correctly validates whether the minimum sum of any strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers is less than or equal to `n`. This is done using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which represents the minimum sum of the first `k` natural numbers. If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, it correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Divisor Calculation**: The divisor `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`. This step is aimed at distributing the total sum `n` evenly among the `k` numbers. The remainder `remainder` is then calculated as `n % min_sum`, representing the leftover amount that needs to be distributed among the sequence.

3. **Sequence Construction**: The function constructs the initial sequence where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`. This ensures that the sequence starts with the smallest possible values and increases strictly.

4. **Adjustment for Remainder**: The function iteratively adjusts the last `remainder` elements of the sequence by incrementing them by `1` until the remainder is zero. This step ensures that the sequence sums up to exactly `n` while maintaining strict increasing order.

5. **Edge Cases**: The provided logic handles edge cases where `n` is exactly the minimum sum required (`k * (k + 1) // 2`), and also ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the algorithm to find a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers whose sum is `n` and has the maximum possible greatest common divisor. If such a sequence cannot be formed, it correctly returns `-1`.

Therefore, the program is logically correct according to the problem description and the provided state transitions.

Correctness: **True**
