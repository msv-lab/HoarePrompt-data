Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly handles the basic condition check where the minimum possible sum of `k` strictly increasing positive integers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) is compared with `n`. If this condition is violated, it returns `-1` as expected.
2. The logic for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and constructing the sequence is implemented. Specifically, the program calculates `d` as `n // min_sum` and then distributes the remainder among the elements of the sequence.
3. The sequence construction logic ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and meets the GCD criteria. It starts by setting each element to `d * (i + 1)` and then adjusts elements from the end to account for the remainder, ensuring the sum remains `n`.
4. The implementation handles all cases mentioned in the examples provided:
   - When `min_sum > n`, it correctly returns `-1`.
   - For valid sequences, it constructs the sequence appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
