The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`, all of which are integers constrained within the range \(1 \leq y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r \leq 10^6\), with additional constraints \(y1 < y2 < yw\), \(yb + r < yw\), and \(2 \cdot r < y2 - y1\). The ball is also positioned correctly in the field, does not cross any wall, and does not touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

The function checks for several conditions:
1. If `yb + r >= yw`, `y1 >= y2`, or `y1 + r >= y2 - r`, the function returns -1.
2. If the midpoint between `y1` and `y2` (`y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`) does not satisfy `y_goal_mid - r < y1` or `y_goal_mid + r > y2`, the function returns -1.
3. If the calculated value of `x_w` (where \(x_w = xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}\)) is less than or equal to 0, the function returns -1.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates and returns `x_w`, ensuring it is greater than 0.
