Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It converts these strings into integers and stores them in variables \(y1\), \(y2\), \(yw\), \(xb\), \(yb\), and \(r\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the same set of parameters and performs several checks to determine if Robo-Wallace can score a goal by hitting the ball to the right wall.
   - It first checks if certain conditions are met, such as the ball's position relative to the wall and goal.
   - If the ball's initial position or any condition violates the requirements, the function returns -1.
   - If all conditions are met, it calculates the x-coordinate \(x_w\) where the ball should be kicked using the formula:
     \[
     x_w = xb - \frac{2 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}
     \]
   - This formula seems to be derived from the physics of reflection and the geometry of the problem.

3. **Calculation Check**:
   - The formula used in the function is correct for calculating the x-coordinate of the point on the right wall where the ball should be kicked. The term \(\frac{2 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}\) represents the horizontal displacement required for the ball to reflect off the wall and land in the goal.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If \(x_w\) is calculated and is positive, it is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.

Given the logical steps and the constraints provided, the function appears to correctly implement the required logic. The provided examples also validate the correctness of the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
