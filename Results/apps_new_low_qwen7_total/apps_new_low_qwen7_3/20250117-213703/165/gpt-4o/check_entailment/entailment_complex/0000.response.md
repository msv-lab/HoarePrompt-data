Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function `func_1` is designed to check if Robo-Wallace can score a goal by bouncing the ball off the right wall and ensuring the ball hits the goal.
    - It first checks basic invalid scenarios:
        - If the ball is already too close to the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at (`yb + r >= yw`).
        - If the wall constraints are violated (`y1 >= y2` or `y1 + r >= y2 - r`).
    - Next, it checks if the goalpost is within the bounds where the ball can potentially reach after bouncing off the wall.
    - Finally, it calculates the x-coordinate `x_w` where the ball needs to be aimed to bounce off the wall and go into the goal.

2. **Calculation of `x_w`**:
    - The formula used to calculate `x_w` is derived from the physics of reflection and the geometry of the setup.
    - Given the setup, the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` is used to find the required x-coordinate.
    - This formula ensures that the ball bounces off the wall at a point such that it travels in a straight line towards the goal.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - The function correctly handles edge cases where the ball cannot possibly reach the goal, returning `-1` in those scenarios.
    - The function ensures that the calculated `x_w` is positive and within the valid range, avoiding issues with negative or invalid values.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**:
    - The function aligns with the problem statement, considering all constraints and conditions.
    - It accurately calculates the required x-coordinate based on the given parameters and checks for invalid scenarios.

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic required to determine whether Robo-Wallace can score a goal by bouncing the ball off the right wall and ensuring it hits the goal.

Correctness: **True**
