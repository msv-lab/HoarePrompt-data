Reasoning:

The given annotated program attempts to solve the problem of finding a point on the right wall where Robo-Wallace should kick the ball so that it bounces once and scores a goal. The program reads input values and calls a function `func_1` to perform the necessary calculations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The input is read and split into individual variables.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first checks if the ball is within the required bounds and if the goal midline is reachable. If either condition fails, it returns `-1`.
   - It calculates the midpoint of the goal `y_goal_mid`.
   - It then checks if the goal midline is within the field boundaries. If not, it returns `-1`.
   - Finally, it calculates the required `x_w` coordinate for the ball to bounce off the wall and still reach the goal. If `x_w` is not valid (e.g., less than or equal to 0), it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the calculated `x_w`.

Let's analyze each part of the logic:

- **Initial Checks**:
  - `yb + r >= yw` ensures the ball does not touch or cross the upper goal boundary.
  - `y1 >= y2` and `y1 + r >= y2 - r` ensure the ball does not touch or cross the lower and right goal boundary.
  - `y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2` ensures the goal midpoint is within the field boundaries.

- **Calculation of `x_w`**:
  - The formula used to calculate `x_w` is derived from the physics of reflection. The formula is:
    \[
    x_w = xb - 2 \cdot \left( \frac{yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}}{\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - yb} \right) \cdot xb
    \]
  - This formula correctly computes the x-coordinate on the right wall where the ball should be kicked to bounce and reach the goal.

- **Final Validation**:
  - The function ensures `x_w` is positive before returning it. If `x_w` is invalid (e.g., less than or equal to 0), it returns `-1`.

Given the detailed steps and validations, the logic in the provided code appears to be correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
