### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and expected solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- Robo-Wallace needs to kick the ball to the right wall such that the ball bounces off the wall and goes straight into the goal.
- The ball must bounce exactly once off the right wall and then go straight into the goal.
- The program should return the x-coordinate (abscissa) of the point on the right wall where the ball should be kicked.
- If no such point exists, the program should return `-1`.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and splits it into variables.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a valid point on the right wall exists.
   - **Boundary Checks**:
     - `if yb + r >= yw`: This ensures the ball is below the target wall (`yw`). Correct.
     - `if y1 >= y2 or y1 + r >= y2 - r`: These checks ensure the goal posts are properly defined. Correct.
   - **Midpoint Calculation**:
     - `y_goal_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the goal's vertical range. Correct.
     - `if y_goal_mid - r < y1 or y_goal_mid + r > y2`: These checks ensure the midpoint of the goal is within the boundaries of the goal. Correct.
   - **Bounce Point Calculation**:
     - `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)`: This formula calculates the x-coordinate of the point on the right wall where the ball should be kicked.
       - The formula assumes the ball travels in a straight line before hitting the wall and then reflects off the wall.
       - However, the formula `x_w = xb - 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` is incorrect. It should be `x_w = xb + 2 * (yb - y_goal_mid) * (xb - 0) / (y_goal_mid - yb)` to correctly reflect the ball off the wall.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns `-1` if no valid point exists.
   - The function returns the calculated `x_w` if a valid point exists.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` and prints the result formatted to 10 decimal places if valid.
   - It prints `-1` if the function returns `-1`.

### Testing and Edge Cases:
The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
- **Case 1**: Valid scenario, ball can be aimed at a point on the right wall to score.
- **Case 2**: Invalid scenario, ball cannot be aimed to score.
- **Case 3**: Valid scenario with different coordinates.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the x-coordinate for the bounce point. The formula used in the function is incorrect, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

#### Corrected Formula:
The correct formula for calculating the x-coordinate of the point on the right wall where the ball should be kicked is:
\[ x_w = xb + 2 \cdot \frac{(yb - y_{goal\_mid}) \cdot (xb - 0)}{(y_{goal\_mid} - yb)} \]

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as correct because it did not verify the bounce point calculation formula. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
