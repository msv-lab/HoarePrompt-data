The code assigns the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2` to `y_goal_mid`. This means `y_goal_mid` is calculated as the average of `y1` and `y2`. The values of `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r` remain unchanged. The conditions given in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `yw` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yw` ≤ 10^6, `xb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `xb` ≤ 10^6, `yb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yb` ≤ 10^6, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ 10^6, `y_goal_mid` = (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, and the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at, `yb` + `r` < `yw`, `y1` < `y2`, and `y1` + `r` < `y2` - `r`**
