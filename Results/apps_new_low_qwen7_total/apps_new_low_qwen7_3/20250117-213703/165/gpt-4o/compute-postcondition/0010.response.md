Postcondition: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `yw` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yw` ≤ 10^6, `xb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `xb` ≤ 10^6, `yb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yb` ≤ 10^6, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ 10^6, `y_goal_mid` = (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `x_w` is `xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}` and `x_w` > 0**
