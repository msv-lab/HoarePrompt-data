The function `func_1` accepts six parameters: `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r`. All of these parameters are integers with specific constraints: \(1 \leq y1, y2, yw, xb, yb, r \leq 10^6\), \(y1 < y2 < yw\), \(yb + r < yw\), and \(2 \cdot r < y2 - y1\). Additionally, the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, and doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at.

The function has four possible return cases:
- Case_1: The program returns -1
- Case_2: The program returns -1
- Case_3: The program returns -1
- Case_4: The function returns `x_w` which is calculated as `xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}` and is greater than 0

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `y1`, `y2`, `yw`, `xb`, `yb`, and `r` and return -1 in three cases, and in the fourth case, it calculates and returns `x_w` which is defined by the given formula and ensures that `x_w` is greater than 0.
