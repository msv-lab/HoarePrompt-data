The code updates the value of `x_w` based on the formula provided. Let's break down the calculation:

- `xb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq xb \leq 10^6\)
- `yb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq yb \leq 10^6\)
- `y_goal_mid` is defined as \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), which means it is the midpoint between `y1` and `y2`.

The formula for `x_w` is:
\[ x_w = xb - 2 \times (yb - y_goal_mid) \times \frac{(xb - 0)}{(y_goal_mid - yb)} \]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x_w = xb - 2 \times (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times \frac{xb}{y_goal_mid - yb} \]

Since \( y_goal_mid = \frac{y1 + y2}{2} \), we substitute this in:
\[ x_w = xb - 2 \times (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times \frac{xb}{(\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - yb)} \]

Further simplification:
\[ x_w = xb - 2 \times (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times \frac{2xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb} \]
\[ x_w = xb - 2 \times \frac{(2yb - y1 - y2) \times 2xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb} \]
\[ x_w = xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb} \]

Given the conditions:
- `yb + r < yw`
- `y1 < y2`
- `y1 + r < y2 - r`
- `y_goal_mid - r ≥ y1` and `y_goal_mid + r ≤ y2`

These conditions do not affect the direct calculation of `x_w`, but they ensure that the positions and conditions for the ball are within the specified range.

Therefore, the updated value of `x_w` is:
\[ x_w = xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb} \]

Output State: **`y1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `y2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y1` < `y2` < `yw` ≤ 10^6, `yw` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yw` ≤ 10^6, `xb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `xb` ≤ 10^6, `yb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `yb` ≤ 10^6, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ 10^6, `y_goal_mid` = (`y1` + `y2`) / 2, `x_w` is `xb - \frac{4 (yb - \frac{y1 + y2}{2}) \times xb}{y1 + y2 - 2yb}`**
