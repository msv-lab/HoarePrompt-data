The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from the input, representing an array. It then checks the trend of the array to determine if it is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. If the array does not follow one of these trends, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include arrays that are constant or have a mix of increasing and decreasing trends, which are handled correctly by the code. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
