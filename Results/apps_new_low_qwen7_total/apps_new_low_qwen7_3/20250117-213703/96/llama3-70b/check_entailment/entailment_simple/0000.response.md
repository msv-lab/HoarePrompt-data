### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The initial variables `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` are correctly initialized to `False`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The for loop iterates from the second element to the last element of the array (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - For each element, the code checks whether the current element is greater than, equal to, or less than the previous element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one (`arr[i] > arr[i-1]`), the code checks if `decreasing` is `True`. If so, it prints 'NO' and exits, indicating the array is not unimodal. Otherwise, it sets `increasing` to `True`.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous one (`arr[i] == arr[i-1]`), the code checks if `increasing` is `True`. If so, it sets `increasing` to `False` and `constant` to `True`. This handles the transition from the increasing phase to the constant phase.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i-1]`), the code checks if `increasing` is `True`. If so, it sets `increasing` to `False`. Then, it sets `decreasing` to `True`. This handles the transition from the constant phase to the decreasing phase.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program prints 'YES' only if no violations of the unimodal condition have occurred during the loop.

The logic in the code correctly follows the conditions for a unimodal array:
- It ensures that there can be at most one transition from increasing to constant and from constant to decreasing.
- It correctly identifies any violations of the unimodal property, such as an increase after a decrease or a non-monotonic sequence within the same phase.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if an array is unimodal based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
