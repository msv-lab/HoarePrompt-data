You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Array of integers is unimodal, if:

  it is strictly increasing in the beginning;  after that it is constant;  after that it is strictly decreasing. 

The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are unimodal: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7], but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is unimodal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1 000) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the given array is unimodal. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 5 5 5 4 2

Output
YES

Input
5
10 20 30 20 10

Output
YES

Input
4
1 2 1 2

Output
NO

Input
7
3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first example the array is unimodal, because it is strictly increasing in the beginning (from position 1 to position 2, inclusively), that it is constant (from position 2 to position 4, inclusively) and then it is strictly decreasing (from position 4 to position 6, inclusively).

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    increasing = False
    constant = False
    decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
    print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

increasing = False

constant = False

decreasing = False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            if decreasing:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            increasing = True
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
                constant = True
        else:
            if increasing:
                increasing = False
            decreasing = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: i is n-1, n is unchanged, `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` reflect the overall trend of the list `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
    print('YES')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly identifies whether an array is unimodal according to the problem statement.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes flags `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` to `False`.

2. **Loop through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1):
     - If the current element is greater than the previous one (`arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be strictly increasing.
       - If `decreasing` is `True` at this point, it means we have a non-strictly increasing sequence followed by a decrease, which violates the unimodal condition. Hence, it prints 'NO' and exits.
       - If `increasing` is already `True`, it remains `True`.
       - If `increasing` was `False`, it becomes `True`.
     - If the current element is equal to the previous one (`arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be in a constant state.
       - If `increasing` is `True`, it transitions to `False` and sets `constant` to `True`.
       - If `increasing` was `False`, `constant` remains `False`.
     - If the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be strictly decreasing.
       - If `increasing` or `constant` is `True` at this point, it means we have a non-decreasing sequence followed by a decrease, which violates the unimodal condition. Hence, it prints 'NO' and exits.
       - If `decreasing` is `False`, it becomes `True`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - After the loop, if no violations were found, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Check:

The logic of the program is correct in terms of identifying the different phases (increasing, constant, decreasing) and ensuring that these phases follow the unimodal pattern. Here’s why the program works:

- It correctly identifies the start of each phase.
- It ensures that once a phase starts (e.g., increasing), it does not get interrupted by another phase until the end of the phase is confirmed.
- It correctly handles the transitions between phases and ensures no violation occurs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work as expected.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The provided program correctly identifies whether an array is unimodal based on the specified conditions.
