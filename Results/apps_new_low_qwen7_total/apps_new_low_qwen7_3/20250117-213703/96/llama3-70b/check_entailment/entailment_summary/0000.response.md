Reasoning: 
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to check if an array is unimodal based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes flags `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` to track the state of the array.
2. **Loop through the array**: It iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. **Increasing Trend**: If the current element is greater than the previous one, it checks if the array has already entered a decreasing phase. If so, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Otherwise, it sets the `increasing` flag to `True`.
4. **Constant Trend**: If the current element is equal to the previous one, it checks if the array has just entered a strictly increasing phase. If so, it sets both `increasing` and `constant` flags accordingly. Otherwise, it only sets the `constant` flag.
5. **Decreasing Trend**: If the current element is less than the previous one, it checks if the array has already entered a constant phase. If so, it sets the `decreasing` flag. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately.
6. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding any violations, it prints 'YES'.

The program handles all potential edge cases such as constant arrays, arrays with a mix of increasing and decreasing trends, and arrays that are purely increasing or decreasing. The logic ensures that the array transitions between states (increasing, constant, decreasing) as per the definition of a unimodal array.

Execution Summary matches the problem requirements and the code's functionality.
