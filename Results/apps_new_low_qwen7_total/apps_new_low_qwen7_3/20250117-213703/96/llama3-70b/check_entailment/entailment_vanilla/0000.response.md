### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly identifies whether an array is unimodal according to the problem statement.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes flags `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` to `False`.

2. **Loop through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1):
     - If the current element is greater than the previous one (`arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be strictly increasing.
       - If `decreasing` is `True` at this point, it means we have a non-strictly increasing sequence followed by a decrease, which violates the unimodal condition. Hence, it prints 'NO' and exits.
       - If `increasing` is already `True`, it remains `True`.
       - If `increasing` was `False`, it becomes `True`.
     - If the current element is equal to the previous one (`arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be in a constant state.
       - If `increasing` is `True`, it transitions to `False` and sets `constant` to `True`.
       - If `increasing` was `False`, `constant` remains `False`.
     - If the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), the array is considered to be strictly decreasing.
       - If `increasing` or `constant` is `True` at this point, it means we have a non-decreasing sequence followed by a decrease, which violates the unimodal condition. Hence, it prints 'NO' and exits.
       - If `decreasing` is `False`, it becomes `True`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - After the loop, if no violations were found, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Check:

The logic of the program is correct in terms of identifying the different phases (increasing, constant, decreasing) and ensuring that these phases follow the unimodal pattern. Hereâ€™s why the program works:

- It correctly identifies the start of each phase.
- It ensures that once a phase starts (e.g., increasing), it does not get interrupted by another phase until the end of the phase is confirmed.
- It correctly handles the transitions between phases and ensures no violation occurs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work as expected.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The provided program correctly identifies whether an array is unimodal based on the specified conditions.
