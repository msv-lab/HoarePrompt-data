Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array starts with a constant segment followed by an increasing segment and then a decreasing segment correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
5
5 5 6 7 6
```

The program should output "NO" because the array starts with a constant segment (5, 5) followed by an increasing segment (6, 7) and then a decreasing segment (7, 6). However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "YES" for this input, as it only checks for increasing, constant, and decreasing segments without properly handling the order and combination of these segments.
