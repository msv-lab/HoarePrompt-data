Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 1, arr[i] is equal to arr[i - 1], increasing is False, constant is True**

Explanation:
- The initial state had `i` as 1, `n` as greater than 1, and `arr[i]` equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
- The condition `(increasing)` being true was part of the initial context but not directly modified by the code.
- The first line of the code sets `increasing` to `False`.
- The second line sets `constant` to `True`.

No other variables were modified, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
