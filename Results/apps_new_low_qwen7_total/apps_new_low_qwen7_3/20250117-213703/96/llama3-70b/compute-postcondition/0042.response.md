The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variables. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is unchanged, `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` reflect the overall trend of the list `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**
