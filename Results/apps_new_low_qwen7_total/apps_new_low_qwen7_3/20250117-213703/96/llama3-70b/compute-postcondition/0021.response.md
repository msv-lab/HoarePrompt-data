Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers. Since there is no else part provided, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition. The condition `decreasing` does not change the values of the variables, only the logic inside the if block would change the state, but since no such changes are mentioned, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
