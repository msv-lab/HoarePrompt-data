Output State: **i is 1, n must be greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, the current value of arr[1] is greater than the value of arr[0], decreasing is false**

Explanation: The code block contains two lines. The first line prints 'NO', but since we are only asked for the final state, this line does not affect the variables. The second line uses `exit()`, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further lines or updating any variables. As a result, the variable `decreasing` is set to `False` due to the `exit()` call overriding its previous state. The other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
