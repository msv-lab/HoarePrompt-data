Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 1, arr is a list of integers**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('NO')` prints 'NO' but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `exit()` terminates the program immediately without modifying any variables.
Since no variables are modified by the code, their states remain the same as the initial state.
