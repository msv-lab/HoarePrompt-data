Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 1, arr is a list of integers**

Explanation:
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed, which prints 'NO' to the console.
- The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately after executing the current line.
- Since the program is terminated, no further operations can modify the variables `i`, `n`, or `arr`.
- Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `arr` remains as a list of integers as per the initial state.
