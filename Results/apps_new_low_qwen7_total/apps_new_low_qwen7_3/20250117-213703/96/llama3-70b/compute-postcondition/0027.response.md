The variable `decreasing` is assigned the value `True`. The initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected, and the state of `arr` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise. Since `increasing` is `False`, no changes are made to any variables based on its condition.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `decreasing` is True**
