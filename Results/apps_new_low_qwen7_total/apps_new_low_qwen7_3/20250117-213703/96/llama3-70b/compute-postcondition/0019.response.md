Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The conditions for `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing` are based on the values of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is still greater than 1.
   - `arr` remains the same list of integers.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The list `arr` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers**.
