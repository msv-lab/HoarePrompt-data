Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `increasing` is False, `constant` is True*** 

Explanation: Since there is no modification of `i`, `n`, `arr`, `increasing`, or `constant` in the if part and no other part of the code to consider, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. The if condition does not change the values of the variables, so the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition provided.
