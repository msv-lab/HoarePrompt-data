The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. The function does not return any value based on the problem statement provided.

However, following the structure you've described for the example, we can reframe this as:

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. No return value is specified.**
