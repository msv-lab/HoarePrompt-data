The code `increasing = False` changes the value of the variable `increasing` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`; `increasing` is False**
