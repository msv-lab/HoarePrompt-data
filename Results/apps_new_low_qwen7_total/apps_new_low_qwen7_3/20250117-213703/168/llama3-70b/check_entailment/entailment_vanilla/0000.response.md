### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads two strings `a` and `b` using the `input()` function.
   
2. **Iterative Matching**:
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are used to traverse through strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - If characters `a[i]` and `b[j]` match, the character is added to the result list `ans`, and both pointers are incremented.
   - If they do not match, only pointer `i` is incremented, moving forward in string `a`.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After the loop, if the resulting list `ans` is empty, the program prints `-`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the concatenated characters of `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm ensures that the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b` are removed to form a subsequence of `a`.
   - It does this by matching characters and skipping over non-matching characters in `a`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The final result is printed as a single string, which is correct for the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description accurately.

### Correctness: **True**
