You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two strings a and b. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string b in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string a. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from b and make it empty.

Subsequence of string s is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string s.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

On the first line output a subsequence of string a, obtained from b by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).


-----Examples-----
Input
hi
bob

Output
-

Input
abca
accepted

Output
ac

Input
abacaba
abcdcba

Output
abcba



-----Note-----

In the first example strings a and b don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.

In the second example ac is a subsequence of a, and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string b.

- Program: 
def func():
    a = input()
    b = input()
    i = 0
    j = 0
    ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == 0:
        print('-')
    else:
        print(''.join(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, with lengths no bigger than 10^5.
def func():
    a = input()

b = input()

i = 0

j = 0

ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, b is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), and ans is a list containing characters from a that match corresponding characters in b, maintaining their order.
    if (len(ans) == 0) :
        print('-')
    else :
        print(''.join(ans))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list containing characters from `a` that match corresponding characters in `b`, maintaining their order. If no such characters exist, `ans` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` contains at least one character from `a` that matches corresponding characters in `b`, maintaining their order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\). It then iterates through both strings simultaneously, comparing each character. If a character in `a` matches the corresponding character in `b`, it is added to the list `ans`. After the loop, if `ans` is empty, it prints `-`; otherwise, it prints the concatenation of the characters in `ans`. The final state of the program is such that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is set to `len(a)`, `j` is set to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list of matching characters from `a` that also appear in `b` in the same order, or an empty list if no such characters exist. The function does not modify the contents of `a` or `b` beyond the comparison process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the minimum number of consecutive characters to remove from `b` is greater than zero. Specifically, the program only checks for matching characters between `a` and `b`, and appends matching characters to the result list `ans`. However, it does not ensure that the removed characters are the minimum consecutive ones required to make `b` a subsequence of `a`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
aaabbbccc
aabbbcccc

Output:
aaabbbccc

Expected Output:
aacc
```

In this case, the program fails to recognize that removing "bbb" from the second string (`aabbbcccc`) would make it a subsequence of the first string (`aaabbbccc`). The program incorrectly outputs the entire string "aaabbbccc" instead of the expected "aacc". Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
