Reasoning:
The provided program logic correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two strings `a` and `b` as required.
2. **Initialization**: Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to iterate through strings `a` and `b`, respectively. A list `ans` is used to store characters that form a subsequence of `a` and also match characters in `b`.
3. **Iterating Through Strings**: A while loop runs until either pointer reaches the end of its respective string. Inside the loop:
   - If the characters pointed to by `i` and `j` are the same, the character from `a` is added to `ans`, and both pointers move forward.
   - If they are different, only the pointer for `a` moves forward.
4. **Output**: After the loop, if `ans` is empty, the program prints `-`. Otherwise, it prints the characters in `ans` joined together as a string.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where no matching subsequence exists by ensuring that it prints an empty string as indicated by the example outputs.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the requirement to find the longest subsequence of `a` that matches a subsequence of `b` by removing the minimum number of consecutive characters from `b`.

Correctness: **True**
