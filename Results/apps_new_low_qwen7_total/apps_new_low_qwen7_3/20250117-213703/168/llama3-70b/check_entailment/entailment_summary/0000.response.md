Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic for finding the longest common subsequence of characters from `b` within `a` by only considering consecutive matching characters. Here's a breakdown:

1. The program initializes pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through strings `a` and `b` respectively.
2. It uses a list `ans` to store the characters that match and form a subsequence from `a` that is also found in `b`.
3. It iterates through both strings, checking for matching characters. If a match is found, it appends the character to `ans` and increments both pointers.
4. If no match is found, it only increments the pointer for `a`.
5. After the loop, it checks if `ans` is empty. If it is, it prints `-`, indicating no common subsequence was found. Otherwise, it prints the concatenated result of `ans`.

Given this logic aligns with the problem statement, the program should work as intended under the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
