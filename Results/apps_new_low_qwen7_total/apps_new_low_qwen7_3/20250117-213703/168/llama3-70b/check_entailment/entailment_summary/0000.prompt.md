Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two strings a and b. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string b in such a way that it becomes a subsequence of string a. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from b and make it empty.

Subsequence of string s is any such string that can be obtained by erasing zero or more characters (not necessarily consecutive) from string s.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 10^5 characters.


-----Output-----

On the first line output a subsequence of string a, obtained from b by erasing the minimum number of consecutive characters.

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).


-----Examples-----
Input
hi
bob

Output
-

Input
abca
accepted

Output
ac

Input
abacaba
abcdcba

Output
abcba



-----Note-----

In the first example strings a and b don't share any symbols, so the longest string that you can get is empty.

In the second example ac is a subsequence of a, and at the same time you can obtain it by erasing consecutive symbols cepted from string b.

# Program:
def func():
    a = input()
    b = input()
    i = 0
    j = 0
    ans = []
    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == 0:
        print('-')
    else:
        print(''.join(ans))





# Execution Summary:
The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\). It then iterates through both strings simultaneously, comparing each character. If a character in `a` matches the corresponding character in `b`, it is added to the list `ans`. After the loop, if `ans` is empty, it prints `-`; otherwise, it prints the concatenation of the characters in `ans`. The final state of the program is such that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is set to `len(a)`, `j` is set to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list of matching characters from `a` that also appear in `b` in the same order, or an empty list if no such characters exist. The function does not modify the contents of `a` or `b` beyond the comparison process.
