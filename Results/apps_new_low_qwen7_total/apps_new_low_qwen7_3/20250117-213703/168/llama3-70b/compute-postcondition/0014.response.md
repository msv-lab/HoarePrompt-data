Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(b)` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `a[0]` equals `b[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing `[a[1], a[2]]` if `a[0] == b[0]`; otherwise, `ans` is a list containing `[a[1]]`.***
