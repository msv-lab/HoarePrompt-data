Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `j` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `a[0]` equals `b[0]`.
   - Both `a` and `b` are non-empty strings with lengths greater than 1.

3. **Check the loop conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i < len(a)` must be true.
   - For the loop to continue, `j < len(b)` must be true.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the condition `i < len(a)` to remain true, `len(a)` must be greater than 2.
   - Since `j` is either 1 or 2, for the condition `j < len(b)` to remain true, `len(b)` must be greater than 2 (because if `j` were 2, then `len(b)` must be at least 3 to satisfy `j < len(b)`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(a)` is greater than 2 and `len(b)` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the lengths of `a` and `b`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(b)` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[0]` equals `b[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing `[a[1]]` if `a[0] == b[0]`; otherwise, `ans` is an empty list.**
