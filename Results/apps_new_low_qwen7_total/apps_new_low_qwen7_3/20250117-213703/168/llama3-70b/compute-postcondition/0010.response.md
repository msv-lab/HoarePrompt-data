Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[0]` equals `b[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing `[a[1]]` if `a[0] == b[0]`; otherwise, `ans` is an empty list.***
