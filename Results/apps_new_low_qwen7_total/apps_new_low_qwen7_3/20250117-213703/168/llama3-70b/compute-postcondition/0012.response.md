Output State: **a is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and len(a) must be greater than 2, b is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and len(b) must be greater than 2, i is 3, j is either 2 or 3 depending on whether a[0] equals b[0], and ans is a list containing [a[1], a[2]] if a[0] == b[0]; otherwise, ans is a list containing [a[1]]**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is set to 2, so `ans.append(a[i])` appends `a[2]` to `ans`, making `ans` contain `[a[1]]` if `a[0] == b[0]` or an empty list if `a[0] != b[0]`.
- After the first line, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The second line increments `j` by 1, making `j` either 2 or 3 depending on whether `a[0]` equals `b[0]`.

Since the first line adds `a[2]` to `ans`, and then `i` is incremented, the final state of `ans` will be `[a[1], a[2]]` if `a[0] == b[0]`, and `[a[1]]` if `a[0] != b[0]`. `i` becomes 3, and `j` is incremented by 1.
