The code `print(''.join(ans))` does not change any variables. It simply joins the elements of the list `ans` into a string and prints it. The output of this print statement is the joined string from `ans`. However, since the variable `ans` itself is not modified by this code, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list containing at least one character from `a` that matches corresponding characters in `b`, maintaining their order**
