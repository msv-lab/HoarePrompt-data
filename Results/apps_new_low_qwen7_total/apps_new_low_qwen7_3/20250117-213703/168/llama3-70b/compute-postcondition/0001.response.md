To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This `while` loop will continue executing as long as both conditions `i < len(a)` and `j < len(b)` are true.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters.
- `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

Let's analyze each condition separately:

1. **Condition `i < len(a)`**:
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - For `i < len(a)` to be true, `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty string, `len(a)` is indeed greater than 0.

2. **Condition `j < len(b)`**:
   - Currently, `j` is 0.
   - For `j < len(b)` to be true, `len(b)` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `b` is a non-empty string, `len(b)` is indeed greater than 0.

Both conditions are satisfied with the given initial values. Therefore, the loop can proceed to execute the first iteration without any modifications to the current state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ans` is an empty list**
