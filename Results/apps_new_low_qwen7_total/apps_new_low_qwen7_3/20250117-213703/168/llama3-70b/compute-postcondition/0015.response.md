Output State: **a is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, b is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, i is equal to len(a), j is equal to len(b), and ans is a list containing characters from a that match corresponding characters in b, maintaining their order.** 

### Explanation:
- **Variables that remain constant:** The initial conditions specify that `a` and `b` are non-empty strings of lowercase letters. The initial values of `i` and `j` start at 0, but once the loop ends, `i` will be equal to the length of `a` and `j` will be equal to the length of `b`.
- **Loop Behavior:**
  - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a` and `j` is less than the length of `b`.
  - If `a[i]` matches `b[j]`, both `i` and `j` are incremented, and the character `a[i]` (which is also `b[j]`) is appended to `ans`.
  - If `a[i]` does not match `b[j]`, only `i` is incremented.
  - This process repeats until either `i` reaches the length of `a` or `j` reaches the length of `b`.
- **Final Values:**
  - `i` will be `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of `a`.
  - `j` will be `len(b)` because the loop increments `j` until it reaches the end of `b`.
  - `ans` will contain all characters from `a` that match corresponding characters in `b`, in the order they appear in `a`.

### Verification:
- If `a` and `b` are of different lengths, the loop will terminate when either index reaches its respective string's length.
- If `a` and `b` are of the same length, the loop will check each character pair `(a[i], b[j])` until one of the indices exceeds the length of the corresponding string.
- The final state ensures that `ans` contains the matching characters, and `i` and `j` reflect the end of their respective strings.
