Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `i < len(a) and j < len(b)`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions inside the loop head need to be true at the start of the next iteration.
3. From the given state, we know:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters.
   - `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters.
4. Since `i` is currently 1, the first part of the loop condition (`i < len(a)`) will be true as long as `len(a)` is greater than 1.
5. Similarly, since `j` is currently 1, the second part of the loop condition (`j < len(b)`) will be true as long as `len(b)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, both `len(a)` and `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ans` remains a list containing one element which is equal to `b[j]` if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`; otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ans` remains an empty list.**
