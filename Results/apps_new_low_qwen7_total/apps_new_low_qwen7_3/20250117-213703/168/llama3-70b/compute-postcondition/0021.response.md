The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\). The function does not return any specific value mentioned in the output, so it likely returns a boolean value or another type of value based on some condition involving `a` and `b`.

However, since no specific conditions or return values are mentioned in the output, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.
