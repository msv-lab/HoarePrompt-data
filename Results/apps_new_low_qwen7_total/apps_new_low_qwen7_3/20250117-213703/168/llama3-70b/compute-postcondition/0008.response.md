Output State: **a is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and len(a) must be greater than 1, b is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and len(b) must be greater than 1, i is 2, j is 2, ans is a list containing the element [a[i-1]] if a[0] == b[0]; otherwise, ans is an empty list**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. `ans` contains one element, which is `b[j]` if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`; otherwise, it's an empty list.
- The first line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was 1, `ans` now contains `[a[1]]`.
- The second line `i += 1` increments `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The third line `j += 1` increments `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
- After these operations, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `ans` contains `[a[1]]` if `a[0] == b[0]`; otherwise, `ans` is an empty list. The lengths of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
