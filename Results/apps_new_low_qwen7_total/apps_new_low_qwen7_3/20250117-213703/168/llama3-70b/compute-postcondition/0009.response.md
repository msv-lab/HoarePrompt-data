The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters and `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ans` remains a list containing one element which is equal to `b[j]` if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`; otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ans` remains an empty list.**
