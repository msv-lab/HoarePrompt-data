The code prints `-`, but this does not affect any of the variables. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `ans` is a list containing characters from `a` that match corresponding characters in `b`, maintaining their order, and the length of `ans` is 0**
