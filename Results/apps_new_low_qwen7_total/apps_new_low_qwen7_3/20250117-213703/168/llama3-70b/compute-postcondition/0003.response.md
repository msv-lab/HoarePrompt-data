The first line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the character `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `b[j]`, the first element in `ans` will be `b[j]`. 

The second line `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. 

The third line `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1.

Since `a[i]` is equal to `b[j]` initially, and both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 after appending `a[i]` to `ans`, the new state after executing these lines is:

Output State: **a is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, b is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, i is 1, j is 1, ans is a list containing one element which is equal to b[j]**
