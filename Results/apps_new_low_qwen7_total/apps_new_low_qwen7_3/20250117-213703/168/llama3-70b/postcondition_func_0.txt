The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet with lengths no bigger than \(10^5\). It then iterates through both strings simultaneously, comparing each character. If a character in `a` matches the corresponding character in `b`, it is added to the list `ans`. After the loop, if `ans` is empty, it prints `-`; otherwise, it prints the concatenation of the characters in `ans`. The final state of the program is such that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is set to `len(a)`, `j` is set to `len(b)`, and `ans` is a list of matching characters from `a` that also appear in `b` in the same order, or an empty list if no such characters exist. The function does not modify the contents of `a` or `b` beyond the comparison process.
