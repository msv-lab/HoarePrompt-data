Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} where 0 ≤ a_{i} < 300.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [(i - x) for i in a]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly one integer. This integer is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`.
    if a :
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else :
        print('BitAryo')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly one integer. If the list `a` contains [0], the first element remains unchanged and the console displays 'BitAryo'. Otherwise, the first element of `a` is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`, and the console displays 'BitAryo'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \) and \( 0 \leq a_i < 300 \). It then repeatedly reduces the list \( a \) by subtracting the minimum non-zero element from each element until only one element remains. This remaining element is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list. Based on whether this final element is even or not, the function prints either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo'. The function handles the case where the initial list might contain zeros, which are removed before performing the subtraction operation.
