You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 1

Output
BitLGM

Input
2
1 2

Output
BitAryo

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
BitLGM

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \) and \( 0 \leq a_i < 300 \). It then repeatedly reduces the list \( a \) by subtracting the minimum non-zero element from each element until only one element remains. This remaining element is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list. Based on whether this final element is even or not, the function prints either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo'. The function handles the case where the initial list might contain zeros, which are removed before performing the subtraction operation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the while loop condition `while len(a) > 1:` is incorrect. According to the problem description, a player loses if they cannot make a move, which happens when all elements in the list are zero. Therefore, the game ends when all elements in the list are zero, not when the length of the list is greater than 1.

A correct implementation would be to continue the game until all elements in the list are zero, and then determine the winner based on whether the last move was made by BitLGM or BitAryo. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Simulate the game until no more moves can be made
    while True:
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            break
        
        if min(a) == 0:
            a = [x for x in a if x != 0]
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    
    # Determine the winner
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the game continues until all elements in the list are zero, and then correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the remaining element.
