You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Since most contestants do not read this part, I have to repeat that Bitlandians are quite weird. They have their own jobs, their own working method, their own lives, their own sausages and their own games!

Since you are so curious about Bitland, I'll give you the chance of peeking at one of these games.

BitLGM and BitAryo are playing yet another of their crazy-looking genius-needed Bitlandish games. They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:

  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \leq x \leq \operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. 

The player who cannot make a move loses.

You're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 300).


-----Output-----

Write the name of the winner (provided that both players play optimally well). Either "BitLGM" or "BitAryo" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 1

Output
BitLGM

Input
2
1 2

Output
BitAryo

Input
3
1 2 1

Output
BitLGM

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    while len(a) > 1:
        if min(a) == 0:
            a.remove(0)
        else:
            x = min(a)
            a = [i - x for i in a]
    if a:
        print('BitLGM' if a[0] % 2 == 0 else 'BitAryo')
    else:
        print('BitAryo')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \) and \( 0 \leq a_i < 300 \). It then repeatedly reduces the list \( a \) by subtracting the minimum non-zero element from each element until only one element remains. This remaining element is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list. Based on whether this final element is even or not, the function prints either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo'. The function handles the case where the initial list might contain zeros, which are removed before performing the subtraction operation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem statement and the examples provided.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Each move can either be taking a single element and decreasing it by some value \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq \text{value of the element} \)), or decreasing all elements by the same value \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq \min(\text{all elements}) \)).
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Program Logic Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of elements \( n \) and the sequence \( a \).
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as there are more than one element in the list.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the minimum element in the list is zero. If it is, it removes that zero.
   - Otherwise, it sets \( x \) to the minimum element and subtracts \( x \) from each element in the list.
   - After exiting the loop, it checks if the list is empty. If not, it determines the winner based on whether the remaining element is even or odd.
   - If the list is empty, it prints "BitAryo".

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `2 1 1`, the program correctly identifies BitLGM as the winner because after the first move, the sequence becomes `[0, 1]` and BitAryo cannot make a valid move.
   - For the input `2 1 2`, the program correctly identifies BitAryo as the winner because BitLGM's only move would result in `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, leaving BitAryo with no valid moves.
   - For the input `3 1 2 1`, the program correctly identifies BitLGM as the winner because after several moves, the sequence will eventually leave BitAryo with no valid moves.

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The program seems to follow a strategy where it tries to force the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves. This aligns with the problem's requirement that both players play optimally.
   - However, the key is whether the logic correctly handles all possible edge cases and optimal moves.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the game rules and logic, and it matches the expected outcomes in the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
