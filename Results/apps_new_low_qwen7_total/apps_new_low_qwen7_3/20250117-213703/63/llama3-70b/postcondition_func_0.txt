The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \) and \( 0 \leq a_i < 300 \). It then repeatedly reduces the list \( a \) by subtracting the minimum non-zero element from each element until only one element remains. This remaining element is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list. Based on whether this final element is even or not, the function prints either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo'. The function handles the case where the initial list might contain zeros, which are removed before performing the subtraction operation.
