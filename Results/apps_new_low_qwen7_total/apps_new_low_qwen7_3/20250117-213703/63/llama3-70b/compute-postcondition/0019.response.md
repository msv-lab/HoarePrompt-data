The code snippet `print('BitAryo')` does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `a`. It only prints the string 'BitAryo' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or 3, `a` is a list containing exactly one integer which is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`, the first element of `a` is 0, and the console displays 'BitAryo'**
