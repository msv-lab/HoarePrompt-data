`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list of 2 integers where each integer is between -299 and 299. The code removes the first occurrence of `0` from the list `a`. Since `a` contains 2 integers, and it is specified that each integer is between -299 and 299, the only way to remove an element is if `0` is one of those integers. After removing `0`, the list `a` will contain one integer (either the first or second element, depending on which one was `0`). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or 3; `a` is a list of one integer (the non-zero element from the original list)**
