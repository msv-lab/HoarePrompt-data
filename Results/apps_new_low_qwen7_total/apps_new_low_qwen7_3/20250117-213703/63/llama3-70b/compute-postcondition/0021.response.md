The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` where `0 ≤ a_{i} < 300`. Based on this input, the function processes the data and returns a value depending on the input. However, since the specific return values are not detailed, we can only describe the input reading part.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3` and `0 ≤ a_{i} < 300`, and returns a value based on this input.**
