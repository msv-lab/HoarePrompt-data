Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly one integer. If the list `a` contains [0], the first element remains unchanged and the console displays 'BitAryo'. Otherwise, the first element of `a` is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`, and the console displays 'BitAryo'.***
