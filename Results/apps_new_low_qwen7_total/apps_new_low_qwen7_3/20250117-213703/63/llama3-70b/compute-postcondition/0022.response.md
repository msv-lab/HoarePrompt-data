Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \) and \( 0 \leq a_i < 300 \). It then repeatedly reduces the list \( a \) by subtracting the minimum non-zero element from each element until only one element remains. This remaining element is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list. Based on whether this final element is even or not, the function prints either 'BitLGM' or 'BitAryo'. The function handles the case where the initial list might contain zeros, which are removed before performing the subtraction operation.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If \( n = 1 \), the list \( a \) will have exactly one element, and no operations will be performed.
- If \( n = 2 \) and both elements are zero, the list will be reduced to an empty list, and 'BitAryo' will be printed.
- If \( n = 3 \) and the list contains zeros, those zeros will be removed before the minimum non-zero element is used to reduce the list.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotation suggests that the final state of the program after the if-else block is such that `a` will always contain exactly one integer. However, when `n = 1` and the single element is 0, the list `a` will remain as `[0]`, and the function should still correctly handle this case by printing 'BitAryo'.
