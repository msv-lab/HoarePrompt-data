Output State: `n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly one integer. This integer is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`.

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 3.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 299.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as the length of `a` is greater than 1.
   - If the minimum value in `a` is 0, it is removed from the list.
   - If the minimum value is not 0, the minimum value `x` is subtracted from each element in `a`.

3. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - The variable `n` is invariant; it does not change throughout the loop.
   - The list `a` changes based on the operations inside the loop.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will continue to run until the length of `a` is reduced to 1.
   - If the minimum value in `a` is ever 0, that 0 will be removed, and the loop will continue with the remaining elements.
   - If the minimum value never becomes 0, the loop will keep adjusting the values until the smallest value becomes 0 (or the list is reduced to a single element).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute because the length of `a` is not greater than 1 initially.
   - If `a` contains only zeros, the loop will remove all zeros until only one zero remains or the list is empty.

Thus, after all executions of the loop, the final state of `a` will be a list containing exactly one integer. This integer will be 0 if any zero was present and not removed, or it will be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a` if no zeros were present and the list was fully adjusted.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly one integer. This integer is either 0 or the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the original list `a`.**
