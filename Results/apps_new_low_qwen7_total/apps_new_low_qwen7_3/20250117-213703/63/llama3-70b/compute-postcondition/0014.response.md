Postcondition: **`n` is 2 or 3. If the minimum element in the list `a` is 0, then `a` is a list of one non-zero integer. Otherwise, `a` is `[difference1, difference2]` where `difference1` and `difference2` are the adjusted values based on the minimum element in the original list `a`, and `x` is the minimum element of the original list `a`**.
