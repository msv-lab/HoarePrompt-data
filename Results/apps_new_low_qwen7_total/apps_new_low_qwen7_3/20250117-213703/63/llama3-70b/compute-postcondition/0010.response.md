Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -299 and 299. If the minimum value in `a` is 0, then `a` is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 0 and 299. Otherwise, `a` remains a list of 2 or 3 integers where each integer is between -299 and 299.***
