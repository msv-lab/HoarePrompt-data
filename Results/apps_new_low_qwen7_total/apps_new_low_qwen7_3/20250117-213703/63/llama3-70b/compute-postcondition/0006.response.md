Postcondition: **`n` is 2 or 3, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 299. If the minimum value in `a` is 0, then the minimum value remains 0. Otherwise, the minimum value in `a` is 0, and each element in `a` is updated to the difference between its original value and 0 (which does not change the values since they are already non-negative).**
