Initial State: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} where 0 ≤ a_{i} < 300.

Code Snippet:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Analysis:
1. The first line of code reads an integer `n` from input and assigns it to the variable `n`.
2. The second line of code reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the result to a list, assigning this list to the variable `a`.

Since the actual input is not provided, we can represent the final state in terms of the variables `n` and `a` based on the given conditions.

Final Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 299**
