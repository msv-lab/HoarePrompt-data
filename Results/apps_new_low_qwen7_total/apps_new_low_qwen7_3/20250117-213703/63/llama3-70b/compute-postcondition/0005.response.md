Initial State: `n` is 2 or 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 299, the minimum value in `a` is not 0

Code Execution:
1. `x = min(a)` - This line calculates the minimum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `x`.
2. `a = [(i - x) for i in a]` - This line creates a new list where each element is the difference between the original elements of `a` and `x`, then reassigns this new list back to `a`.

Final Output State: **n is 2 or 3, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 299, the minimum value in a is 0, and the new values in a are the differences between the original values and the minimum value in a**
