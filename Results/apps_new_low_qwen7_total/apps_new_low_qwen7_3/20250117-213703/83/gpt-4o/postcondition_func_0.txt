The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `marks` where each integer in `marks` is between 1 and `k`. It calculates the minimum number of additional integers, each equal to `k`, needed to be added to `marks` such that the average of the resulting list (including these additional integers) is at least `k`. If the initial average of `marks` is already at least `k`, it returns 0. The function prints and returns the number of additional integers needed.
