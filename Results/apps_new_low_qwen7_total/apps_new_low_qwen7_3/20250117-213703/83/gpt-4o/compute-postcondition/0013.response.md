The code `current_average = current_sum / current_count` updates the value of `current_average` by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given the initial state where `current_sum` is 15 and `current_count` is 4, the new value of `current_average` will be \( \frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \).

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 4, `current_average` is 3.75**
