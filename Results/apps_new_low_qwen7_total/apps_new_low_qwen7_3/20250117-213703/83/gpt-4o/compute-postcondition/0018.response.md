The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition but refers to variables `n`, `k`, and `marks`. The constraints are that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `marks` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `k`. 

The output depends on the internal processing of these variables, but based on the given information alone, we cannot determine the exact return value without more context.

Functionality: **The function accepts variables `n`, `k`, and `marks` (where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `marks` is a list of `n` integers each satisfying 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `k`).**
