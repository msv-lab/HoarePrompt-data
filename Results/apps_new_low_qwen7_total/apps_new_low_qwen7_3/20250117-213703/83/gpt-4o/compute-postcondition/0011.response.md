The initial state is:
- `n` is 3
- `k` is 3
- `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
- `current_sum` is 12
- `current_count` is 3
- `current_average` is 4

The code block to execute is:
```python
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

Let's analyze the impact of these lines:

1. The first line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 3) to `current_sum`. So, `current_sum` becomes `12 + 3 = 15`.
2. The second line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` by 1. So, `current_count` becomes `3 + 1 = 4`.

No other variables are affected by this code block.

Next, we need to check if `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`. From the initial state, `current_average` is 4, so `math.ceil(4)` is still 4, which is equal to `k` (which is 3). Since the condition is met, the function continues with the updated state.

The final state after executing the code block is:
- `n` is 3 (unchanged)
- `k` is 3 (unchanged)
- `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] (unchanged)
- `current_sum` is 15
- `current_count` is 4
- `current_average` is 3.75 (calculated as `current_sum / current_count`)

Output State: **n is 3, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 15, current_count is 4, current_average is 3.75**
