The code updates the value of `current_average` to be the result of `current_sum / current_count`. Given the initial values, `current_sum` is 12 and `current_count` is 3, so `current_average` is calculated as `12 / 3`, which equals 4.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `marks`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 3, `current_average` is 4**
