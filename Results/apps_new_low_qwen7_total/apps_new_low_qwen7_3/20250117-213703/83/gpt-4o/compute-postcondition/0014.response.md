The first line `print(current_count - n)` calculates the difference between `current_count` and `n` and prints it, which is `4 - 3 = 1`. The value of `1` is printed. The second line `break` is a statement used in loops to exit the loop prematurely. However, there is no loop in the provided code, so this statement does not affect any variables and is essentially ignored in this context.

Given that the print statement affects the output but not the state of variables, and considering the initial state, the variables remain unchanged except for the print statement's output.

Output State: **n is 3, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 15, current_count is 4, current_average is 3.75**
