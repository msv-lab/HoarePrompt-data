The only variable in the loop head is the boolean expression `True`, which always evaluates to `True`. This means that the loop will definitely execute at least once regardless of the values of other variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the variables `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, or `current_count` to allow the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 5**
