Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `marks` where each integer in `marks` is between 1 and `k`. It calculates the minimum number of additional integers, each equal to `k`, needed to be added to `marks` such that the average of the resulting list (including these additional integers) is at least `k`. If the initial average of `marks` is already at least `k`, it returns 0. The function prints and returns the number of additional integers needed.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the initial average of `marks` is already at least `k`, the function correctly returns 0.
- If the input list `marks` is empty, the function will attempt to calculate the average using `current_sum` and `current_count`, which are initially set to 0, leading to a division by zero error. This case should be handled by checking if `current_count` is zero before calculating the average.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no input validation to ensure that `n` and `k` are within the specified range (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). This should be included to prevent errors and ensure the function behaves correctly.
