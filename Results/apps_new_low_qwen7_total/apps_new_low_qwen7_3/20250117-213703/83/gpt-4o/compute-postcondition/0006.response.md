The initial state is: `n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 2, `current_average` is 1.8.

The code block consists of two lines:
1. `current_sum += k`
2. `current_count += 1`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines:

1. `current_sum += k`: The current value of `current_sum` is 9, and `k` is 3. So, `current_sum` will be updated to `9 + 3`, which is 12.
2. `current_count += 1`: The current value of `current_count` is 2. After this line, it will be updated to `2 + 1`, which is 3.

No other variables are modified by the code, and the conditions or functions do not change any of the existing values.

Therefore, the final state after executing the code block is:
Output State: **n is 3, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 12, current_count is 3, current_average is 1.8**
