Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

**Initial State:**
- `n` is 5
- `k` is 3
- `marks` is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
- `current_sum` is 9
- `current_count` is 5

**Loop Code:**
```python
while True:
    current_average = current_sum / current_count
    if math.ceil(current_average) >= k:
        print(current_count - n)
        break
    current_sum += k
    current_count += 1
```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

**Invariants:**
- `k` remains constant at 3.
- `n` remains constant at 5.
- `marks` remains unchanged as it is not used within the loop.

**Variables Updated:**
- `current_sum` increases by `k` each iteration.
- `current_count` increases by 1 each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

Each iteration of the loop:
1. Updates `current_sum` by adding `k`.
2. Updates `current_count` by adding 1.
3. Calculates `current_average` using the updated `current_sum` and `current_count`.
4. Checks if `math.ceil(current_average)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

If the condition is met (`math.ceil(current_average) >= k`), the loop breaks and prints `current_count - n`. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the provided outputs:
- After 1 iteration: `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 6, `current_average` is 2.
- After 2 iterations: `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 7, `current_average` is 2.142857.
- After 3 iterations: `current_sum` is 18, `current_count` is 8, `current_average` is 2.25.

We can see that `current_average` is increasing, but `math.ceil(current_average)` remains less than `k` (which is 3) until after 6 iterations. At this point, `current_sum` will be 21, `current_count` will be 9, and `current_average` will be 2.333333, leading to `math.ceil(current_average)` being 3.

Therefore, the loop will execute 6 times before breaking.

### Final Output State

After 6 iterations:
- `current_sum` = 21 + 3 = 24
- `current_count` = 9 + 1 = 10
- The loop condition checks `math.ceil(24/10) = 3`, so it breaks and prints `10 - 5 = 5`.

**Output State:**
Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 24, current_count is 10, current_average is 2.4.**
