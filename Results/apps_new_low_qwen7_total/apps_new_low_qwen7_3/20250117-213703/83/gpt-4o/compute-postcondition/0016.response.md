The initial state is: `n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 4, `current_average` is 3.75.

The code snippet is:
```
current_sum += k
current_count += 1
```

- The first line `current_sum += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 3) to `current_sum`. So, `current_sum` becomes `15 + 3 = 18`.
- The second line `current_count += 1` increments `current_count` by 1. So, `current_count` becomes `4 + 1 = 5`.

No other variables are affected by this code block.

Output State: **n is 3, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 18, current_count is 5, current_average is 3.75**
