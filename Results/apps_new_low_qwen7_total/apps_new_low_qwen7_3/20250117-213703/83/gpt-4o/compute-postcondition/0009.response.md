The first line `print(current_count - n)` calculates the difference between `current_count` (which is 3) and `n` (which is 3), resulting in 0. This value is printed, but it does not modify any variables.

The second line `break` is a statement used in loops to exit the loop prematurely. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, this statement does not affect any variables or the flow of execution.

Given that no variables are modified by these lines of code, the final state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **n is 3, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 12, current_count is 3, current_average is 4**
