For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute as long as the loop body continues to run, without any condition to check. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 12, `current_count` is 3, `current_average` is 1.8**
