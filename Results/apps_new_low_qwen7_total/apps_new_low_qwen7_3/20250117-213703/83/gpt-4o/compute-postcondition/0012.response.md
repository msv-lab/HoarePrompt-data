The `while True` loop runs indefinitely as long as no break statement is encountered. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time because it will always continue to run.

However, since we need to follow the format and provide a state, we can state that the loop will continue to execute regardless of the current values of the variables.

State: **`n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 4, `current_average` is 3.75**
