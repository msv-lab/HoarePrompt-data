Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 15, `current_count` is 4, `current_average` is 3.75. If the ceiling of `current_average` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function does nothing. Since there is no else part, the function also does nothing if the condition is not met. Therefore, the overall state remains unchanged.***
