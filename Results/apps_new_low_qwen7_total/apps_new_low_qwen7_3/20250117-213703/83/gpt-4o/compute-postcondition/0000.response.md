The initial state is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `marks` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `k`.

The code snippet provided reads two inputs separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Then it reads a list of `n` integers separated by spaces and assigns them to `marks`. It also calculates the current sum of the `marks` list and assigns it to `current_sum`, and initializes `current_count` to `n`.

Let's assume the input is as follows (for illustration purposes):
```
5 3
1 2 3 2 1
```

After executing the code:
- `n` is set to 5.
- `k` is set to 3.
- `marks` is set to `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
- `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of the elements in `marks`, which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9`.
- `current_count` is initialized to `n`, so `current_count` is 5.

Thus, the output state after running the code is:
Output State: **n is 5, k is 3, marks is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], current_sum is 9, current_count is 5**

Note: The actual values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, and `current_count` depend on the input provided during the execution of the code. The above example is based on a hypothetical input to illustrate the process.
