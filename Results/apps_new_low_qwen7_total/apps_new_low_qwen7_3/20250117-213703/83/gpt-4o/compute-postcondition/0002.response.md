The code calculates the current average by dividing `current_sum` by `current_count`. Given that `current_sum` is 9 and `current_count` is 5, the value of `current_average` will be `9 / 5`, which is `1.8`. The values of `n`, `k`, `marks`, `current_sum`, and `current_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `k` is 3, `marks` is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], `current_sum` is 9, `current_count` is 5, `current_average` is 1.8**
