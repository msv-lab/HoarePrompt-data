### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of marks `n` and the maximum mark `k`.
   - It then reads the list of marks.

2. **Current Average Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the marks and the count of marks are computed.

3. **Loop Until Condition Met**:
   - The program enters a loop where it repeatedly checks the current average.
   - The current average is calculated as `current_sum / current_count`.
   - The condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` checks if the current average, when rounded up, meets or exceeds `k`.
   - If the condition is met, the program prints `current_count - n`, which represents the number of additional marks added.
   - If the condition is not met, the program adds the maximum mark `k` to the sum and increments the count by 1.

The logic seems sound, but we need to verify if the loop will always terminate and if the minimal number of additional marks is indeed added.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Termination of the Loop**:
   - The loop will continue to add marks until the current average, when rounded up, meets or exceeds `k`.
   - Since the maximum mark `k` is always added in each iteration, the average will eventually reach or exceed `k`, ensuring the loop will terminate.

2. **Minimality of Additional Marks**:
   - Each time the loop runs, the average is increased by `k/current_count`.
   - The loop ensures that the minimal number of additional marks are added by incrementally increasing the sum and count until the condition is met.

3. **Rounding Consideration**:
   - The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the average is rounded up, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - This guarantees that the minimal number of additional marks are added to achieve the required average.

Given these points, the program should correctly compute the minimal number of additional marks needed to achieve the desired final mark `k`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to ensure the minimal number of additional marks are added to achieve the required final mark `k`.

Final: **True**
