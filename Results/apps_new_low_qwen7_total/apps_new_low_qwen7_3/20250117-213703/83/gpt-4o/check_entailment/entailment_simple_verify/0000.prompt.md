You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Noora is a student of one famous high school. It's her final year in school — she is going to study in university next year. However, she has to get an «A» graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.

In school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to k. The worst mark is 1, the best is k. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784 — to 8. 

For instance, if Noora has marks [8, 9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8, 8, 9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.

To graduate with «A» certificate, Noora has to have mark k.

Noora got n marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark k. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to k. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ k) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to k.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 10
8 9

Output
4
Input
3 5
4 4 4

Output
3


-----Note-----

Consider the first example testcase.

Maximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks — 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.

In the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate.

    current_count = n
    while True:
        current_average = current_sum / current_count
        if math.ceil(current_average) >= k:
            print(current_count - n)
            break
        current_sum += k
        current_count += 1



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and marks is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ k.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

marks = list(map(int, input().split()))

current_sum = sum(marks)

current_count = n
    while True:
        current_average = current_sum / current_count
        
        if math.ceil(current_average) >= k:
            print(current_count - n)
            break
        
        current_sum += k
        
        current_count += 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the current average is already greater than or equal to \(k\) but rounding down would still result in a lower grade. Specifically, if the current average is just below \(k\), adding one more mark of \(k\) might not be sufficient to reach the required grade due to rounding rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10
9 9 9
```

- The current sum of marks is \(9 + 9 + 9 = 27\).
- The current count of marks is \(3\).
- The current average is \(27 / 3 = 9\).

Since the current average is 9, which is less than 10, the program would check if adding one more mark of 10 would make the average at least 10. However, the new average would be:

\[ \frac{27 + 10}{4} = \frac{37}{4} = 9.25 \]

Rounding 9.25 to the nearest integer gives 9, which is not sufficient to achieve a final grade of 10. Therefore, the program would incorrectly output 1 (the number of additional marks added), whereas the correct answer should be 10 additional marks to achieve an average of at least 10.

This example demonstrates that the program fails to correctly handle cases where the average is just below the required grade, leading to an incorrect output.
