Reasoning:
To determine if the provided solution is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of marks `n` and the maximum mark `k`, followed by the list of marks.
2. **Current Average Calculation**: The program calculates the initial sum of the marks and the count of marks.
3. **Loop Until Condition Met**: The program enters a loop where it:
   - Calculates the current average.
   - Checks if the ceiling of the current average is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the difference between the current count of marks and the initial count (`current_count - n`), indicating the number of additional marks needed.
   - If the condition is not met, it adds the maximum mark `k` to the sum and increments the count by 1.

This approach ensures that the program keeps adding the maximum mark until the required average is achieved, and it stops as soon as the condition is satisfied. This is the optimal way to minimize the number of additional marks added.

Given the logic and steps involved, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring the minimal number of additional marks is added to achieve the desired final mark `k`.

Correctness: **True**
