Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Noora needs to achieve a final mark of `k` on her graduation certificate.
- The final mark is determined by the average of all marks rounded up to the nearest integer.
- We need to find the minimum number of additional marks (each equal to `k`) that must be added to the existing marks to achieve a final mark of `k`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: Correctly reads `n` and `k`, and the list of marks.
2. **Current Average Calculation**: Calculates the initial sum and count of marks.
3. **Loop Until Condition Met**: Enters a loop to keep adding `k` to the sum and incrementing the count until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
4. **Condition Check**: If the condition is met, it prints and returns the difference between the current count and the initial count, indicating the number of additional marks needed.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function correctly calculates the minimum number of additional marks needed to achieve a final mark of `k`.

### Verification of Correctness:
- **Initial Sum and Count Calculation**: Correct.
- **Loop Logic**: The loop correctly adds `k` to the sum and increments the count until the condition is met.
- **Ceiling Function Usage**: The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the average is rounded up correctly.
- **Optimality**: The loop is designed to add the minimum number of marks needed, as it stops as soon as the condition is met.

### Edge Cases:
- **If Initial Average is Already >= k**: The program correctly prints `0` in this case.
- **If Adding One More k is Enough**: The program correctly calculates the minimal number of additional marks.

### Conclusion:
The provided program logic matches the problem requirements and the function summary accurately describes its behavior. The original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
