Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of additional marks (each equal to `k`) needed to be added to Noora's existing marks to ensure her final average mark is at least `k`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of marks (`n`) and the maximum mark (`k`).
   - It then calculates the sum and count of the existing marks.
   - A loop continues to add `k` to the sum and increment the count until the current average is at least `k`.
   - The loop stops when the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
   - The number of additional marks added (`current_count - n`) is printed and returned.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The loop ensures that the minimum number of additional marks (`k`) are added to achieve the required average.
   - The use of `math.ceil` correctly handles the rounding rule specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the initial average is already at least `k`, no additional marks are needed, and the program correctly returns 0.
   - The loop will always terminate because the average will eventually meet or exceed `k`.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
