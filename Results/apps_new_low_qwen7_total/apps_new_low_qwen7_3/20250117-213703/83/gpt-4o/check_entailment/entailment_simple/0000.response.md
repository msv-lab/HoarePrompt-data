Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of marks.
2. It calculates the initial sum of the marks and counts the number of marks.
3. The program uses a `while` loop to incrementally increase the sum and count until the condition `math.ceil(current_average) >= k` is met.
4. In each iteration of the loop, it adds `k` to the current sum and increments the count by 1.
5. Once the condition is satisfied, it prints the difference between the final count and the original count `n`, which represents the minimal number of additional marks needed.
6. The logic to calculate the minimal number of additional marks seems correct, as it ensures that the average of the marks (including the added ones) rounds up to `k`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program logic appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
