You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Noora is a student of one famous high school. It's her final year in school — she is going to study in university next year. However, she has to get an «A» graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.

In school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to k. The worst mark is 1, the best is k. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784 — to 8. 

For instance, if Noora has marks [8, 9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8, 8, 9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.

To graduate with «A» certificate, Noora has to have mark k.

Noora got n marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark k. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to k. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ k) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to k.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 10
8 9

Output
4
Input
3 5
4 4 4

Output
3


-----Note-----

Consider the first example testcase.

Maximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks — 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10, 10, 10, 10] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to $\frac{8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10}{6} = \frac{57}{6} = 9.5$. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.

In the second example Leha can add [5, 5, 5] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    current_sum = sum(marks)
    current_count = n
    while True:
        current_average = current_sum / current_count
        if math.ceil(current_average) >= k:
            print(current_count - n)
            break
        current_sum += k
        current_count += 1


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
