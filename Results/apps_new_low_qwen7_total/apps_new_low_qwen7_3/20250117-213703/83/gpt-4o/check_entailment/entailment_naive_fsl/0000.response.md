Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the current average is already greater than or equal to \(k\) but rounding down would still result in a lower grade. Specifically, if the current average is just below \(k\), adding one more mark of \(k\) might not be sufficient to reach the required grade due to rounding rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10
9 9 9
```

- The current sum of marks is \(9 + 9 + 9 = 27\).
- The current count of marks is \(3\).
- The current average is \(27 / 3 = 9\).

Since the current average is 9, which is less than 10, the program would check if adding one more mark of 10 would make the average at least 10. However, the new average would be:

\[ \frac{27 + 10}{4} = \frac{37}{4} = 9.25 \]

Rounding 9.25 to the nearest integer gives 9, which is not sufficient to achieve a final grade of 10. Therefore, the program would incorrectly output 1 (the number of additional marks added), whereas the correct answer should be 10 additional marks to achieve an average of at least 10.

This example demonstrates that the program fails to correctly handle cases where the average is just below the required grade, leading to an incorrect output.
