Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values of `n` and `k`, and the list of marks.
2. It initializes `current_sum` with the sum of the existing marks and `current_count` with the number of existing marks.
3. It enters a loop where it continuously checks if the current average (including potential additional marks) is at least `k`.
4. If the current average is already at least `k`, the program breaks the loop and returns `0` (which is printed).
5. If the current average is less than `k`, it adds one more mark (`k`) to both `current_sum` and `current_count` and recalculates the average.
6. The loop continues until the condition is met, and when it does, it calculates and prints the number of additional marks needed (`current_count - n`).

Given the logic, the program seems to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The program will keep adding marks until the average meets the requirement, and it will correctly count and return the number of additional marks required.

Correctness: **True**
