Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders of \( n \) divided by each integer from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to check for distinct remainders.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles the edge case where \( k \geq n \). In this case, at least one remainder will be 0 (from \( n \% n \)), which means the remainders cannot all be distinct. Therefore, it correctly returns 'No'.
4. **Remainder Calculation and Set Usage**: 
   - A set `seen_remainders` is used to store unique remainders.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), the remainder \( n \% i \) is calculated.
   - If the remainder has already been seen (i.e., it exists in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, the remainder is added to the set.
5. **Final Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

Given that the logic matches the problem description and the provided execution summary accurately reflects the intended behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
