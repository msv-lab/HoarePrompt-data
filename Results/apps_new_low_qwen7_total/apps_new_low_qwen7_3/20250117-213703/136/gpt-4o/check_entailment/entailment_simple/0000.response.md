Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all the remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, which are then passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Early Exit Condition**: The function `func_1` immediately returns 'No' if \( k \geq n \). This condition is correct because if \( k \geq n \), at least one of the remainders \( n \mod i \) must repeat (since \( n \mod n = 0 \) and \( n \mod 1 = n \neq 0 \)).

3. **Set to Track Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders encountered during the loop. Sets inherently store unique elements, so any duplicate remainder will cause the program to return 'No'.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \), calculating \( n \mod i \) for each \( i \). If the remainder is already in the `seen_remainders` set, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.

5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

Given the annotations and the logical flow, the program correctly checks for distinct remainders and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
