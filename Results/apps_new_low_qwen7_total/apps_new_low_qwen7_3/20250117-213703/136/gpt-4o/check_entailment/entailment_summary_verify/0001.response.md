### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness using the given function summary.

#### Input Parsing and Function Call:
1. The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input.
2. It calls the `func_1` function with these values.

#### Function Logic:
- **Base Case Check**: If \( k \geq n \), it immediately returns "No". This is a correct base case because if \( k \geq n \), then at least one remainder will be zero (for \( i = n \)), and thus, the remainders cannot all be distinct.
- **Set for Tracking Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders encountered.
- **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
  - For each divisor \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \mod i \).
  - If this remainder has already been seen, it returns "No".
  - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
- **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes".

Given the function summary, the logic in `func_1` is consistent with the problem description. The function correctly checks for distinct remainders by maintaining a set of seen remainders and returning "No" as soon as a duplicate is found.

The original assessment is accurate because:
- The logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.
- The base case check ensures that the program behaves correctly when \( k \geq n \).
- The use of a set to track remainders is efficient and ensures that duplicates are detected early.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
