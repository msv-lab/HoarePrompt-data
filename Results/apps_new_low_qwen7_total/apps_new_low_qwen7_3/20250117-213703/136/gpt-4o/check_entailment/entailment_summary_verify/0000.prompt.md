You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It checks whether there are any repeated remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during the process, the function returns 'No'. If no remainder repeats by the end of the loop (i.e., after checking all integers from 1 to `k`), the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) divided by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Here’s why:

1. **Handling Large Values**: The program correctly handles large values of \( n \) and \( k \) up to \( 10^{18} \). It uses a set to keep track of the remainders, which ensures that no remainder is repeated.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k \geq n \), the program returns "No" correctly because the modulo operation with 1 will always result in 0, and any number modulo itself results in 0, leading to duplicate remainders.
   - For other values of \( k \), the program iterates through each integer from 1 to \( k \), calculates the remainder, and checks if it has already been seen. If a remainder is found in the set, it immediately returns "No". Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues until all remainders are checked.
3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(4, 4)`, the remainders are \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \). Since \( 0 \) is repeated, the output is "No".
   - For the input `(5, 3)`, the remainders are \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \). All remainders are distinct, so the output is "Yes".

Given these points, the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
