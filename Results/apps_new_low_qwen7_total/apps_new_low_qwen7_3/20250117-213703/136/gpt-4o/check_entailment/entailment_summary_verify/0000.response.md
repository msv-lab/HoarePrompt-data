### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program works as intended based on the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects of the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns "No" immediately, as this scenario implies at least one remainder will be zero.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - It then iterates over each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
   - If the remainder is already in the set `seen_remainders`, it returns "No" indicating that a duplicate remainder has been found.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns "Yes".

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It checks for duplicate remainders using a set.
- It returns "No" as soon as it finds a duplicate.
- It returns "Yes" only if no duplicates are found after checking all integers from 1 to \( k \).

The examples provided also correctly illustrate the expected behavior:
- For input `(4, 4)`, the remainders are \( 0, 0, 1, 0 \), which includes a duplicate, hence the output is "No".
- For input `(5, 3)`, the remainders are \( 0, 1, 2 \), which are all distinct, hence the output is "Yes".

Since the program and the function summary match the problem requirements and the examples provided, the original assessment is accurate.
