### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the `func_1` function with these values.
3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Base Case Check**: If \( k \geq n \), it immediately returns "No". This is because for any \( n \), the remainders modulo \( n \) or larger will repeat or be zero, which violates the condition of distinct remainders.
   - **Set for Tracking Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
     - For each divisor \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \mod i \).
     - If this remainder has already been seen, it returns "No".
     - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
   - **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes".

This logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and does not have any logical errors or inefficiencies.
