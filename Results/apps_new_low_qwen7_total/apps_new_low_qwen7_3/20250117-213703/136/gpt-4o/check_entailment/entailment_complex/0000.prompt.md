Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

# Annotated Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and k is less than n
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'No' if any computed remainder is already in `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using `remainder = n % i`.
    #   - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
    #   - Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
    #   - `seen_remainders`: Contains unique remainders of `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - `remainder`: Changes in each iteration but only its value matters for determining the final output.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue as long as no repeated remainder is found.
    #   - If a repeated remainder is found, the loop exits and returns 'No'.
    #   - After all iterations (if no early exit due to repeated remainder), the loop ends.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - `i` will reach `k` after `k` iterations.
    #   - `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
    #   - The function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are repeated; otherwise, it does not return anything (implying it returns 'Yes').
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the variables after all executions of the loop would be as described above.
    return 'Yes'
    #`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'Yes' if no computed remainder is repeated
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It checks whether there are any repeated remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during the process, the function returns 'No'. If no remainder repeats by the end of the loop (i.e., after checking all integers from 1 to `k`), the function returns 'Yes'.
