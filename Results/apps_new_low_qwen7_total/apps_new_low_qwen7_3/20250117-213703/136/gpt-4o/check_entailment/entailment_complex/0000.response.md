Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to check if all remainders of \( n \) modulo \( i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The initial `if` condition checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because if \( k \geq n \), at least one of the remainders must repeat since the maximum possible remainder when dividing by \( n \) or less is \( n-1 \).

3. **Loop Logic**: 
   - A `set` named `seen_remainders` is used to track unique remainders.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
   - For each \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
   - If this remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, it means a repeated remainder is found, and the function returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, the remainder is added to `seen_remainders`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

The program logic accurately follows the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
