### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the `func_1` function with these values.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Base Case Check**:
     - The function checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns "No". This is correct because if \( k \geq n \), the remainders will either repeat or include zero, violating the condition of distinct remainders.
   - **Set for Tracking Remainders**:
     - A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - **Loop Through Possible Divisors**:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
       - For each divisor \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \mod i \).
       - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns "No".
       - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
   - **Final Output**:
     - If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes".

The provided annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the program. Let's verify the logic with the examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - The remainders are \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \)
  - Since \( 0 \) is repeated, the function returns "No".

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - The remainders are \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \)
  - All remainders are distinct, so the function returns "Yes".

Given the logic and the examples, the program correctly implements the required functionality. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the code.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and behavior of the program. Therefore, the final evaluation should maintain the original assessment.

**Final: True**
