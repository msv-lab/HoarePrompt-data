### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The program needs to determine if all remainders of \( n \) when divided by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k \geq n \) by immediately returning "No" because modulo 1 will always result in 0, and modulo \( n \) itself will also result in 0.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It first checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns "No".
   - A set `seen_remainders` is used to store the remainders encountered during the iteration.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), the remainder \( n \% i \) is calculated.
   - If the remainder is already in the set, the function returns "No".
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it is added to the set.
   - If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the function returns "Yes".

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The use of a set ensures that no remainder is repeated because sets do not allow duplicates.
   - The function correctly identifies and returns "No" if any remainder is repeated.
   - The function correctly returns "Yes" if no remainder is repeated.
   - The handling of the edge case \( k \geq n \) is implemented correctly.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(4, 4)`, the remainders are \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \). Since \( 0 \) is repeated, the output is "No".
   - For the input `(5, 3)`, the remainders are \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \). All remainders are distinct, so the output is "Yes".

Given the analysis and verification, the original assessment is correct.
