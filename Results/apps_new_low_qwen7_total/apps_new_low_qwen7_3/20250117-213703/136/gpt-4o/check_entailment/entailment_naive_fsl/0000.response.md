Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) divided by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling Large Values**: The program correctly handles large values of \( n \) and \( k \) up to \( 10^{18} \). It uses a set to keep track of the remainders, which ensures that no remainder is repeated.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k \geq n \), the program returns "No" correctly because the modulo operation with 1 will always result in 0, and any number modulo itself results in 0, leading to duplicate remainders.
   - For other values of \( k \), the program iterates through each integer from 1 to \( k \), calculates the remainder, and checks if it has already been seen. If a remainder is found in the set, it immediately returns "No". Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues until all remainders are checked.
3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(4, 4)`, the remainders are \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \). Since \( 0 \) is repeated, the output is "No".
   - For the input `(5, 3)`, the remainders are \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \). All remainders are distinct, so the output is "Yes".

Given these points, the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
