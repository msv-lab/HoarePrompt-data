You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.

- Program: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'



- Annotated Code: 
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and k is less than n
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'No' if any computed remainder is already in `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using `remainder = n % i`.
    #   - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
    #   - Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
    #   - `seen_remainders`: Contains unique remainders of `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - `remainder`: Changes in each iteration but only its value matters for determining the final output.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue as long as no repeated remainder is found.
    #   - If a repeated remainder is found, the loop exits and returns 'No'.
    #   - After all iterations (if no early exit due to repeated remainder), the loop ends.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - `i` will reach `k` after `k` iterations.
    #   - `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
    #   - The function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are repeated; otherwise, it does not return anything (implying it returns 'Yes').
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the variables after all executions of the loop would be as described above.
    return 'Yes'
    #`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'Yes' if no computed remainder is repeated



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input.
2. **Function Call**: It calls the `func_1` function with these values.
3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Base Case Check**: If \( k \geq n \), it immediately returns "No". This is because for any \( n \), the remainders modulo \( n \) or larger will repeat or be zero, which violates the condition of distinct remainders.
   - **Set for Tracking Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is used to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
     - For each divisor \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \mod i \).
     - If this remainder has already been seen, it returns "No".
     - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
   - **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes".

This logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and does not have any logical errors or inefficiencies.
