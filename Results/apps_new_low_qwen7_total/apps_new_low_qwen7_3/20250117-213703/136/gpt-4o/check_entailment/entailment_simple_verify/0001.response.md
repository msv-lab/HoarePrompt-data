### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and its annotated version to validate the original assessment.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The parsed integers are passed to the `func_1` function.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Base Case Check**: The function checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns "No" because the remainders modulo \( n \) or larger will repeat or be zero, violating the condition of distinct remainders.
   - **Set for Tracking Remainders**: A set `seen_remainders` is initialized to keep track of the remainders encountered.
   - **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \).
     - For each divisor \( i \), it calculates the remainder of \( n \mod i \).
     - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns "No".
     - Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders.
   - **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns "Yes".

The annotations provided in the annotated code align with the program's logic and the problem statement. Let's verify the key points:

- **Base Case Check**: The base case check is correctly implemented and ensures that the function returns "No" if \( k \geq n \).
- **Set for Tracking Remainders**: The use of a set to track remainders ensures that each remainder is checked only once, and duplicates are identified efficiently.
- **Loop Through Possible Divisors**: The loop correctly iterates through all divisors from 1 to \( k \) and checks for duplicate remainders.
- **Final Output**: The function correctly returns "Yes" if no duplicate remainders are found and "No" if a duplicate is found.

Given the clear and correct implementation of the logic described in the problem statement, the program behaves as expected. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and logic.

### Conclusion:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately implements the required functionality to check if all remainders of \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct.
