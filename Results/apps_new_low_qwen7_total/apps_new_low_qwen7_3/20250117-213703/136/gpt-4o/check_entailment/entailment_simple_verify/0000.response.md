### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Program Flow**:
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` and prints its return value.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)`:
     - Checks if \( k \geq n \). If true, it returns 'No'.
     - Initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders.
     - Iterates over each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \).
       - Calculates the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \).
       - Checks if the remainder is already in `seen_remainders`. If true, it returns 'No'.
       - Adds the remainder to `seen_remainders`.
     - If no repeated remainders are found, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( k \) and checks for duplicate remainders.
   - If a duplicate remainder is found, the function returns 'No' immediately.
   - If no duplicates are found after the loop completes, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Handling Large Values**: The program correctly handles large values of \( n \) and \( k \) up to \( 10^{18} \) using a set to store remainders, ensuring no duplicates.
   - **Edge Case Handling**:
     - When \( k \geq n \), the program returns 'No' correctly because the modulo operation with 1 will always result in 0, and any number modulo itself results in 0, leading to duplicate remainders.
     - For other values of \( k \), the program iterates through each integer from 1 to \( k \), calculates the remainder, and checks if it has already been seen. If a remainder is found in the set, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues until all remainders are checked.
   - **Example Verification**:
     - For the input `(4, 4)`, the remainders are \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \). Since \( 0 \) is repeated, the output is "No".
     - For the input `(5, 3)`, the remainders are \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \). All remainders are distinct, so the output is "Yes".

Given these points, the program correctly checks if all remainders of \( n \) divided by integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
