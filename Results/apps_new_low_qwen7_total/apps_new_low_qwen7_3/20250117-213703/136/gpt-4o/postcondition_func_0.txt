The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It checks whether there are any repeated remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during the process, the function returns 'No'. If no remainder repeats by the end of the loop (i.e., after checking all integers from 1 to `k`), the function returns 'Yes'.
