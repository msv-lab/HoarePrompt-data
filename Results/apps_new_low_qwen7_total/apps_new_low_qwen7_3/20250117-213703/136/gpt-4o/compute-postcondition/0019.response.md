The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. Given that `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen_remainders` initially contains either {0} or {0, 1}, adding `remainder` to `seen_remainders` will result in one of the following sets: {0, 1} if `remainder` was not already in the set, or `{0}` if `remainder` was already 0.

Since the initial state of `seen_remainders` could be either {0} or {0, 1}, after adding `remainder`, `seen_remainders` will be {0, 1}. The values of `i`, `k`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Additionally, the function's return value remains unspecified unless `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, which it now is.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is {0, 1}, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the function returns 'No' if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`.**
