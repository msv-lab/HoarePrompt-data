The code assigns the remainder of `n` divided by `i` to the variable `remainder`. Since `i` is 3 and `remainder` can be either 0 or 1, the value of `remainder` will be either 0 or 1.

- If `remainder` is 0, then `remainder` will be 0.
- If `remainder` is 1, then `remainder` will be 1.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `seen_remainders`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is a set containing {0, 1} if `remainder` is 1 or {0} if `remainder` is 0, `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is a set containing {0, 1} if `remainder` is 1 or {0} if `remainder` is 0, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
