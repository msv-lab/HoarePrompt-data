The code adds the `remainder` to the `seen_remainders` set. Since `remainder` is 0, and `seen_remainders` was initially an empty set, adding 0 to the set will create a set containing only 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is a set containing {0}, `remainder` is 0**
