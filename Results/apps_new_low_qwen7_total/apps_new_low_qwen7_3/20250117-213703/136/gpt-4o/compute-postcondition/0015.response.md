Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`, and `k` must be at least `1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, after the first iteration where `i` is `2`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.
   - **Variable `k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged unless modified inside the loop body, but since no modification is specified, `k` stays the same.

Given that the loop condition checks if `i` is within the range `1` to `k + 1`, and `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue as long as `k` is at least `2` (since `i` can go up to `k + 1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `3`, and `k` must still be at least `1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is a set containing {0, 1} if `remainder` is 1 or {0} if `remainder` is 0, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
