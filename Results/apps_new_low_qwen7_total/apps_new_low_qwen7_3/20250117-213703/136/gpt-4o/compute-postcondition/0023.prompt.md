You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and k is less than n
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'No' if any computed remainder is already in `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using `remainder = n % i`.
    #   - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
    #   - Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
    #   - `seen_remainders`: Contains unique remainders of `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - `remainder`: Changes in each iteration but only its value matters for determining the final output.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue as long as no repeated remainder is found.
    #   - If a repeated remainder is found, the loop exits and returns 'No'.
    #   - After all iterations (if no early exit due to repeated remainder), the loop ends.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - `i` will reach `k` after `k` iterations.
    #   - `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
    #   - The function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are repeated; otherwise, it does not return anything (implying it returns 'Yes').
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the variables after all executions of the loop would be as described above.
    return 'Yes'
    #`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'Yes' if no computed remainder is repeated
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function has multiple return points: it returns 'No' in five cases and returns 'Yes' if `i` equals `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, and no computed remainder is repeated.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `n` and `k` and return 'Yes' under specific conditions related to remainders and computed values, otherwise it returns 'No'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'No'

Case_3: The program returns 'No'

Case_4: The program returns 'No'

Case_5: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'Yes' if no computed remainder is repeated


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
