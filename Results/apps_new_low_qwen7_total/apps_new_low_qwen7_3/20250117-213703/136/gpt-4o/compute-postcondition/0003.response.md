The code initializes a set named `seen_remainders`. This set does not affect the values of `n` and `k`; it simply introduces a new variable. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
