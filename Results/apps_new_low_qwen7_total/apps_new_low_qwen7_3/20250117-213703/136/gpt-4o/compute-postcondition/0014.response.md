`seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. The value of `remainder` is either 0 or 1. Since `seen_remainders` initially contains {0}, if `remainder` is 1, `seen_remainders` will become {0, 1}. If `remainder` is 0, `seen_remainders` remains {0}. The values of `i` and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is a set containing {0, 1} if `remainder` is 1 or {0} if `remainder` is 0, `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
