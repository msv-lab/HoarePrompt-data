The code calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, the remainder `remainder` will be `n % 1`, which is always 0 for any integer `n`. The value of `i` does not change, and the state of `seen_remainders` remains an empty set because no remainders have been added yet.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `remainder` is 0**
