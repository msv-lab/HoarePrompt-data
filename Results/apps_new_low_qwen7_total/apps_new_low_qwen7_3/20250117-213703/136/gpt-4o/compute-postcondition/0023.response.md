Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It checks whether there are any repeated remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during the process, the function returns 'No'. If no remainder repeats by the end of the loop (i.e., after checking all integers from 1 to `k`), the function returns 'Yes'.**

This summary covers all the key points of the function's behavior as determined by the actual code and annotations, including the potential edge cases where the function might return 'No'. It also notes the final state of the program after the function concludes, highlighting the conditions under which 'Yes' is returned.
