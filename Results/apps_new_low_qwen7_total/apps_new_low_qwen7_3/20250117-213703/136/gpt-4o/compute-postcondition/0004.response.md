Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`, but since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the condition for the first iteration is simply that `i` should be within the range `[1, k + 1)`.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop**: We know:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute its first time, `i` must be `1` (the starting value) and it must be less than or equal to `k`.

5. **Ensure Validity of `k`**: Since `k` must be a valid value for the loop to start, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `1`.

Given these points, the state of the objects in the loop head must satisfy the following conditions for the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` must be `1`.
- `k` must be at least `1`.

Since `seen_remainders` is an empty set and does not affect the initial loop condition, it remains as an empty set.

Therefore, the final state should be:
**`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
