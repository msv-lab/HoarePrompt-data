The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function has multiple return points: it returns 'No' in five cases and returns 'Yes' if `i` equals `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, and no computed remainder is repeated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `n` and `k` and return 'Yes' under specific conditions related to remainders and computed values, otherwise it returns 'No'.
