Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'No' if any computed remainder is already in `seen_remainders`.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using `remainder = n % i`.
   - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to `seen_remainders`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
   - `seen_remainders`: Contains unique remainders of `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - `remainder`: Changes in each iteration but only its value matters for determining the final output.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue as long as no repeated remainder is found.
   - If a repeated remainder is found, the loop exits and returns 'No'.
   - After all iterations (if no early exit due to repeated remainder), the loop ends.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - `i` will reach `k` after `k` iterations.
   - `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
   - The function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are repeated; otherwise, it does not return anything (implying it returns 'Yes').

Thus, the final state of the variables after all executions of the loop would be as described above.
