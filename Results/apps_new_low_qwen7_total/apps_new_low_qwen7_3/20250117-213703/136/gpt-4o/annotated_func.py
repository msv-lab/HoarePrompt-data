    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` using `remainder = n % i`.
    #   - If this remainder has already been seen (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function immediately returns 'No'.
    #   - Otherwise, it adds the new remainder to `seen_remainders`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
    #   - `seen_remainders`: Contains unique remainders of `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
    #   - `remainder`: Changes in each iteration but only its value matters for determining the final output.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will continue as long as no repeated remainder is found.
    #   - If a repeated remainder is found, the loop exits and returns 'No'.
    #   - After all iterations (if no early exit due to repeated remainder), the loop ends.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - `i` will reach `k` after `k` iterations.
    #   - `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
    #   - The function returns 'No' if any of these remainders are repeated; otherwise, it does not return anything (implying it returns 'Yes').
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the variables after all executions of the loop would be as described above.
    return 'Yes'
    #`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `seen_remainders` is a set containing remainders from 1 to `k` inclusive, `remainder` is the last computed remainder, and the function returns 'Yes' if no computed remainder is repeated
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It checks whether there are any repeated remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during the process, the function returns 'No'. If no remainder repeats by the end of the loop (i.e., after checking all integers from 1 to `k`), the function returns 'Yes'.
