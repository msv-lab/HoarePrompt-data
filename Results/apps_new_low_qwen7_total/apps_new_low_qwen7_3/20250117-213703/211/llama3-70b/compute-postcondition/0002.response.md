`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `prefix_sum[1]` (since `i + 1` equals 1) is updated to the sum of `prefix_sum[0]` and `a[0]`. The value of `prefix_sum[0]` is not explicitly stated, but it does not affect the calculation since `i` is 0. The value of `a[0]` is also not provided, but the equation shows that `prefix_sum[1]` will be `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]; n` must be greater than 0**
