The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is `n`
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`
- `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`
- ...
- `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` is `1`
- `l` is `1`
- `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`
- `r` is `1`
- and the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`

The code snippet is:
```python
print(k, l, r)
k += 1
l = r
```

Let's analyze each line:
1. `print(k, l, r)` - This prints the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Since `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, and `r` is `1`, it will print `1 1 1`.
2. `k += 1` - This increments `k` by `1`. So, `k` becomes `2`.
3. `l = r` - This assigns the value of `r` to `l`. Since `r` is `1`, `l` becomes `1`.

After running the code, the updated values are:
- `k` is `2`
- `l` is `1`
- `r` remains `1`

The values of `i`, `prefix_sum`, `n`, and the other conditions remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **k is 2, l is 1, r is 1**
