Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, ..., `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` remains unchanged. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, the function does not change any additional variables. If `prefix_sum[n]` is not 0 or `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k`, `l`, and `r` are all set to `m` and `prefix_sum[n]` is not 0.**
