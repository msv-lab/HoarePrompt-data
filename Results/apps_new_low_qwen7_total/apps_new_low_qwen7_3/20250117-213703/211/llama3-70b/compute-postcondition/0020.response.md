Output State: **i is 4, n is 4, prefix_sum[1] is 1, prefix_sum[2] is 3, prefix_sum[3] is 6, prefix_sum[4] is 10, k is 2, l is 3, r is 3, n remains unchanged, prefix_sum[n] is 10, prefix_sum[r] is 6**

Explanation:
- The first line `print(k, l, r)` prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` which are 3, 2, and 3 respectively.
- The second line `k += 1` increments `k` by 1, so `k` becomes 4.
- The third line `l = r` sets `l` to the value of `r`, so `l` becomes 3.

All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions of `i` being `n`, `prefix_sum` being the cumulative sums of `a`, `n` remaining unchanged, `prefix_sum[r]` not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `prefix_sum[n]` not equal to 0 are still valid and unchanged by the code execution.
