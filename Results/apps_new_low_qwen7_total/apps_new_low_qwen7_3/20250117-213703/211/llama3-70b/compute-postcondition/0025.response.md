The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array `A`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` ( - 10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array `A`. Based on the input, the function processes the array but does not return anything explicitly.

Given the output description structure, it seems there might be an implicit return of some processing result, but since the problem statement only mentions reading input without specifying an output, we assume the function performs some internal processing and does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of the number of elements in an array followed by the array elements, processes the array internally, and does not return any value.**
