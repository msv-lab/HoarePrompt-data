Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`
   - `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0] + a[1]`
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2.

5. **Value of `n`**: Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 2 (because `i` will be incremented to 2, and the loop needs to continue).

6. **Prefix Sum Values**: The values of `prefix_sum[1]` and `prefix_sum[2]` do not change within the loop head, so they remain the same.

7. **Final Adjusted States**: Based on the above reasoning, we update the states accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0] + a[1]`, `n` must be greater than 2**
