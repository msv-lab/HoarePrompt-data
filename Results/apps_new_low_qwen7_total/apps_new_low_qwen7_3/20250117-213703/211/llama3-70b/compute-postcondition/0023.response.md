The code `print(k, l, n)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within this line of code, the values of `k`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, ..., `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `m`, `l` is `m`, `r` is `m`, and `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
