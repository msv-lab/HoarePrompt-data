Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided initial and intermediate states to determine the final state after all executions of the loop.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is the number of elements in the array \( a \).
- \( a \) is a list of \( n \) integers.
- \( prefix\_sum \) is a list of length \( n+1 \) with all elements equal to 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range \( n \), updating the `prefix_sum` list as follows:
```python
for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
```

### Observations
1. **Invariants**:
   - The length of `prefix_sum` remains \( n+1 \).
   - Each element in `prefix_sum` is initially 0.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - On each iteration, the current value of `prefix_sum[i+1]` is computed as the sum of the previous value of `prefix_sum[i]` and the current element of the array `a[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Iteration
- After 0 iterations: 
  - `i` is 0.
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]` (which is 0 + a[0]).
  - `n` must be greater than 0.

- After 1 iteration:
  - `i` is 1.
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is still `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.
  - `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]` (which is (0 + a[0]) + a[1]).
  - `n` must be greater than 1.

- After 2 iterations:
  - `i` is 2.
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is still `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.
  - `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]` (which is (0 + a[0]) + a[1]).
  - `prefix_sum[3]` is `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]` (which is ((0 + a[0]) + a[1]) + a[2]).
  - `n` must be greater than 2.

- After \( k \) iterations (where \( k < n \)):
  - `i` is \( k \).
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is still `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.
  - `prefix_sum[k+1]` is `prefix_sum[k] + a[k]`.
  - `n` must be greater than \( k \).

### Final State
After \( n \) iterations, the loop completes, and the final state will be:
- `i` is \( n \).
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]` (which simplifies to just `a[0]` since `prefix_sum[0]` is 0).
- `prefix_sum[2]` is `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]` (which simplifies to `a[0] + a[1]`).
- `prefix_sum[n+1]` is `prefix_sum[n] + a[n]` (which simplifies to the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`).
- `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state of the loop is:

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`; `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`; ...; `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`; `n` remains unchanged.**
