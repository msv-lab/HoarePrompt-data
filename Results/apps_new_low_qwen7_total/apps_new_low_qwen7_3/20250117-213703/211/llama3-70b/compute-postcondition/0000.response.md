The given code reads the number of elements `n` in an array and the array elements themselves, then initializes a prefix sum array. Let's break down the effects of each line:

1. `n = int(input())`: Reads an integer `n` and stores it in the variable `n`.
2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them to a list of integers, storing it in the variable `a`.
3. `prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)`: Initializes a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros and stores it in the variable `prefix_sum`.

Since the actual values of `n` and `a` depend on the input, we cannot specify exact values without knowing the input. However, we can describe the state after running the code:

- The variable `n` holds the number of elements in the array `a`.
- The variable `a` is a list containing `n` integers.
- The variable `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `0`.

Given this analysis, the final output state will be:

Output State: **n is the number of elements in the array, a is a list of n integers, prefix_sum is a list of length n+1 with all elements equal to 0**
