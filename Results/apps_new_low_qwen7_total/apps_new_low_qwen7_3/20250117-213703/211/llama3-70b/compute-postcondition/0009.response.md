The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variables or their values; it only prints a string. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, ..., `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` remains unchanged, and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0**
