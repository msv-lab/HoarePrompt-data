Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (since it was already greater than 0 and no operation inside the loop changes its value).

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `prefix_sum[1]` is `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
