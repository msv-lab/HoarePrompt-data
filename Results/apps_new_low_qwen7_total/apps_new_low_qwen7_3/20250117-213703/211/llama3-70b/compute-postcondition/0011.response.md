Output State: **i is n, prefix_sum[1] is a[0], prefix_sum[2] is a[0] + a[1], ..., prefix_sum[n+1] is the sum of all elements in a, n remains unchanged, k is 1, l is 1, prefix_sum[n] is not equal to 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` simply prints "YES" to the console but does not modify any variables.
- The second line `k = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `k`.
- The third line `l = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `l`.

No other variables are affected by the provided code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `prefix_sum`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
