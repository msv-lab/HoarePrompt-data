To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the number of elements in the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements equal to 0.

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - `n` controls the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Initial Conditions for the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the valid range of `range(n)`.
   - The range `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **State Before the First Execution of the Loop:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 at the beginning.
   - `n` should be such that the loop can execute at least once (i.e., `n > 0`).

4. **Prefix Sum List:**
   - The `prefix_sum` list is not directly involved in the loop condition but must exist and be properly initialized as described.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since `range(n)` requires `n > 0` to generate at least one value).

Therefore, the state before the first execution of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
