Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( \text{`i` is `n`} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`} \)
- \( \dots \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`} \)
- \( \text{`n` remains unchanged} \)
- \( \text{`k` is 2} \)
- \( \text{`l` is 1} \)
- \( \text{`r` is 1} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`} \)

### Loop Head:
```
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable \( r \) starts from 1 and goes up to \( n \).
- At the end of the previous iteration, \( r \) is 1.
- For the loop to execute again, \( r \) needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, \( r \) will become 2 in the next iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- \( \text{`i` remains `n`} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[1]` remains `a[0]`} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[2]` remains `a[0] + a[1]`} \)
- \( \dots \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[n+1]` remains the sum of all elements in `a`} \)
- \( \text{`n` remains unchanged} \)
- \( \text{`k` remains 2} \)
- \( \text{`l` remains 1} \)
- \( \text{`r` changes to 2} \)
- \( \text{`prefix_sum[n]` remains not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` now is `prefix_sum[2]` (which is `a[0] + a[1]`)} \)

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, ..., `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`**
