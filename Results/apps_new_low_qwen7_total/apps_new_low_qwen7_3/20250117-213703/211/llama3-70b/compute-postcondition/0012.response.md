To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the first execution of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

Given state before the loop:
- `i` is `n`
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`
- `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`
- ...
- `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` is `1`
- `l` is `1`
- `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`

Loop statement:
```
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `r = 1` to `r = n`.

2. **Determining Initial Values for `r`:**
   - On the first iteration, `r` should be set to `1`.

3. **Checking Other Variables:**
   - `i`, `k`, and `l` do not directly affect the loop condition since they are not used in the loop header.
   - `prefix_sum[n]` being non-zero does not influence the loop's first iteration but could affect other parts of the loop body.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `r` must be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - At the start, `r` should be `1`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute its first iteration, the initial value of `r` must be `1`. This means that after the loop starts, `r` should be `1`.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, ..., `prefix_sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, and `r` is `1`**.
