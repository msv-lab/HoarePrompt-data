### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and validate it against the problem statement using the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums and stores them in the `prefix_sum` list. This is correct and necessary for checking the sum of subarrays.

3. **Check for Zero Total Sum**:
   - If the total sum of the array is zero (`prefix_sum[n]`), the program correctly prints "NO". This is correct because if the total sum is zero, it's impossible to split the array into non-zero sum parts.

4. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program then checks for subarrays with non-zero sums. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
     - The program assumes that if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the subarray from `l` to `r-1` has a non-zero sum. This is incorrect because `prefix_sum[r]` could be zero while `prefix_sum[n]` is non-zero, meaning the subarray from `l` to `r-1` could still have a non-zero sum.
     - The current implementation only considers `prefix_sum[r]` but does not ensure that the subarray from `l` to `r-1` has a non-zero sum.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program follows the required output format to indicate whether a valid split is possible and how the array can be split into subarrays.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 -3`
  - Output: `YES\n2\n1 2\n3 3`
  - Explanation: The program correctly splits the array into subarrays `[1, 2]` and `[-3]`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `8\n9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3`
  - Output: `YES\n2\n1 2\n3 8`
  - Explanation: The program correctly splits the array into subarrays `[9, -12]` and `[3, 4, -4, -10, 7, 3]`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `1\n0`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to split the array since the total sum is zero.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `4\n1 2 3 -5`
  - Output: `YES\n4\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4`
  - Explanation: The program correctly splits the array into individual elements.

### Critical Issue:
The main issue is in the logic used to identify subarrays with non-zero sums. The program incorrectly assumes that `prefix_sum[r]` being non-zero implies that the subarray from `l` to `r-1` has a non-zero sum. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the subarray itself has a zero sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle the case where a subarray has a zero sum but is still part of a valid split.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
