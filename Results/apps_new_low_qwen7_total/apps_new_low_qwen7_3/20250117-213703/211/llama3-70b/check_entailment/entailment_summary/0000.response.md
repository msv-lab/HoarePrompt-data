Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains some flaws. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array.
2. **Check for Zero Sum Subarray**: The program incorrectly checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero to determine if a zero-sum subarray exists. This check is unnecessary and misleading because the goal is to split the array into subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum, not to avoid a zero-sum subarray.
3. **Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the array into subarrays is flawed. The program assumes that if it finds a prefix sum that is not zero and different from the final prefix sum, it should print the current subarray. However, this approach does not guarantee that the entire array will be split into valid subarrays where each subarray has a non-zero sum. It also doesn't handle the case where the array itself forms a valid split.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
