Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of elements in the array (`n`) and reads the array elements (`a`).
2. It then computes the prefix sums of the array elements and stores them in the `prefix_sum` list. This allows us to check if the sum of elements in any subarray is non-zero.
3. The program checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is, it prints "NO" since it's impossible to split the array into non-empty subarrays with non-zero sums.
4. If the total sum is not zero, it enters a loop to find subarrays with non-zero sums. For each `r` from 1 to `n`, it checks if `prefix_sum[r]` is non-zero and different from `prefix_sum[n]`. If so, it prints the indices of the subarray and increments the count of subarrays (`k`), updating the starting index of the next subarray (`l`).
5. After the loop, it prints the last subarray indices.
6. The final state of the program matches the problem requirements and examples provided.

Given the logic and the steps followed by the program, it appears to handle all edge cases correctly, such as when the array sum is zero or when there are multiple valid ways to split the array.

Correctness: **True**
