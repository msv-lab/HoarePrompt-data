Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. The main issue lies in how the function determines whether the array can be split into subarrays with non-zero sums. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the case where the array itself cannot be split into subarrays with non-zero sums.

In the annotated program, the function checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero to determine if the array can be split. However, this check is not sufficient. The correct approach should involve checking for subarrays whose sums are non-zero as the array is traversed.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array.
2. **Zero Sum Check**: The function incorrectly assumes that if `prefix_sum[n]` is not zero, the array can be split into subarrays with non-zero sums. This is not always true because the entire array might have a sum of zero, making it impossible to split it into subarrays with non-zero sums.
3. **Subarray Identification**: The function tries to find subarrays with non-zero sums but does not correctly identify them all.

To fix this, the function needs to:
- Check if there is any subarray whose sum is non-zero.
- Ensure that the entire array cannot be a single subarray with zero sum.

The current implementation fails to correctly handle these cases. Therefore, the provided code does not fully satisfy the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
