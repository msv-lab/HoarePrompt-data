You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input array \(A\) consisting of \(n\) integers. It calculates the prefix sums of the array and checks if there exists a subarray whose sum is zero. If such a subarray exists, the function prints the starting and ending indices of the subarray along with the count of valid subarrays found. If no subarray with a sum of zero exists, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the entire array sums to zero or when the array contains only positive or negative numbers. If the array sum is zero, the function will still correctly identify the subarray indices. If the array contains only positive or negative numbers, the function will correctly identify that no subarray sums to zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down what the program does and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates the prefix sums and stores them in the `prefix_sum` list. This step is necessary to check the sum of subarrays.
3. **Check for Zero Total Sum**: If the total sum of the array is zero (`prefix_sum[n]`), the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to split the array into non-zero sum parts.
4. **Splitting the Array**: If the total sum is not zero, the program attempts to find subarrays such that each subarray has a non-zero sum. It iterates through the array, and whenever it finds a subarray with a non-zero sum (and this sum is not equal to the total sum), it prints those indices and increments the count of new subarrays.
5. **Output Format**: The program follows the required output format to indicate whether a valid split is possible and how the array can be split into subarrays.

Let's verify each part against the problem statement:

- The program correctly identifies when splitting is impossible (total sum is zero).
- It correctly identifies valid subarrays where the sum is non-zero and ensures these subarrays do not overlap.
- It maintains the required format for output.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
