### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem requirements again to verify its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and stores them in the `prefix_sum` list. This step is crucial for checking the sum of subarrays.

3. **Check for Zero Total Sum**:
   - The program correctly prints "NO" if the total sum of the array is zero, as it is impossible to split the array into non-zero sum parts.

4. **Splitting the Array**:
   - Here is the critical part of the program's logic:
     ```python
     for r in range(1, n + 1):
         if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
             print(k, l, r)
             k += 1
             l = r
     ```
   - The intention here is to find subarrays with non-zero sums. However, there are some issues with this logic:
     - The variable `l` is initialized to 1, and it is updated to `r` whenever a subarray with a non-zero sum is found.
     - The condition `prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` ensures that the subarray does not have the same sum as the total sum, which would make it unnecessary to split further.
     - The condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0` ensures that the subarray has a non-zero sum.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly follows the required output format to indicate whether a valid split is possible and how the array can be split into subarrays.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic inside the loop. Let's consider an example:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input:
3
1 2 -3
```
- The prefix sums are: `[0, 1, 3, 0]`.
- The program prints:
  - `YES`
  - `2`
  - `1 2`
  - `3 3`

This is correct, but let's consider another case to test the edge scenarios.

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input:
4
1 2 3 -5
```
- The prefix sums are: `[0, 1, 3, 6, 1]`.
- The program prints:
  - `YES`
  - `4`
  - `1 1`
  - `2 2`
  - `3 3`
  - `4 4`

This is also correct.

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input:
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
```
- The prefix sums are: `[0, 9, -3, 0, 4, -10, -3, 0, 3]`.
- The program prints:
  - `YES`
  - `2`
  - `1 2`
  - `3 8`

This is correct as well.

#### Edge Case Analysis:
- The program fails to handle the case where the array itself is a valid subarray with a non-zero sum and does not need further splitting.
- For instance, consider an array where the total sum is non-zero, and the entire array forms a valid subarray.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    Input:
    3
    1 2 3
    ```
    - The prefix sums are: `[0, 1, 3, 6]`.
    - The program should print:
      - `YES`
      - `1`
      - `1 3`
    - But it currently prints:
      - `YES`
      - `2`
      - `1 1`
      - `2 3`

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the case where the entire array forms a valid subarray without needing further splitting. This leads to an incorrect output for certain valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct as it does not handle the edge case where the entire array forms a valid subarray without needing further splitting.
