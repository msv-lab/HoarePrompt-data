Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the entire array sums to zero. According to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, it is not possible to split the array into non-zero sum subarrays. However, the program does not check this condition and incorrectly outputs "YES" and proceeds to split the array, which is not allowed.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0
```
The program will output:
```
YES
1
1 3
```
This is incorrect because the entire array sums to zero, and it is not possible to split it into non-zero sum subarrays. Therefore, the program should output "NO" in this case.
