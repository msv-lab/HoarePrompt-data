Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down what the program does and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates the prefix sums and stores them in the `prefix_sum` list. This step is necessary to check the sum of subarrays.
3. **Check for Zero Total Sum**: If the total sum of the array is zero (`prefix_sum[n]`), the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to split the array into non-zero sum parts.
4. **Splitting the Array**: If the total sum is not zero, the program attempts to find subarrays such that each subarray has a non-zero sum. It iterates through the array, and whenever it finds a subarray with a non-zero sum (and this sum is not equal to the total sum), it prints those indices and increments the count of new subarrays.
5. **Output Format**: The program follows the required output format to indicate whether a valid split is possible and how the array can be split into subarrays.

Let's verify each part against the problem statement:

- The program correctly identifies when splitting is impossible (total sum is zero).
- It correctly identifies valid subarrays where the sum is non-zero and ensures these subarrays do not overlap.
- It maintains the required format for output.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
