The code `i += 6` increments the value of `i` by 6. The initial state indicates that `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\). The value of `x` itself is not affected by this operation. The function mentioned in the initial state does not influence the operation of `i += 6`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\); `i` is increased by 6.**
