`i` is assigned the value 5. The initial conditions for `x` (it is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 < x ≤ 1000, and x is greater than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5**
