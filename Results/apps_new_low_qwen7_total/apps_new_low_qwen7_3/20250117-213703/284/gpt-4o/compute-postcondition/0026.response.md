Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 1000. It returns `False` for all values of `x` except when `x` is 1000. For `x` = 1000, the function returns `True`. The function checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, 3, or if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` in these cases. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks divisibility up to the square root of `x` using a while loop, returning `False` if `x` is divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts from 5 and increments by 6. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.**

This summary covers all the potential cases and the actual logic performed by the code, ensuring that all conditions and edge cases are included.
