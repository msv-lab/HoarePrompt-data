Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\). `i` is adjusted such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x\). If `x` is divisible by `i` or `x` is divisible by `i + 2`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or returns True implicitly).***
