Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`.
3. **Determine the current state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is increased by 6 after each iteration. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 6.
4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, the condition `i * i <= x` must still hold true.

Given the current state:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\) and `x` is not divisible by 2 and `x` is not divisible by 3 and `x \geq 25\).
- `(x \% (i + 6) != 0 and x \% (i + 8) != 0)` is satisfied.
- `i` is increased by 6.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`.

Since `i` is increased by 6 after each iteration, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. The next value of `i` will be `i_current + 6`.

For the loop to continue, the following must be true:
\[ (i_current + 6) * (i_current + 6) \leq x \]

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` satisfies this condition for the next iteration.

**State after the previous iteration:**
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\) and `x` is not divisible by 2 and `x` is not divisible by 3 and `x \geq 25\).
- `(x \% (i + 6) != 0 and x \% (i + 8) != 0)` is satisfied.
- `i` is increased by 6.

**State required for the next iteration:**
- Ensure that the new value of `i` (i.e., `i + 6`) satisfies the condition `i * i <= x`.

Thus, the state required for the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\) and `x` is not divisible by 2 and `x` is not divisible by 3 and `x \geq 25\), `(x \% (i + 6) != 0 and x \% (i + 8) != 0)` is satisfied, and `(i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x`**.
