The initial state indicates that `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), and `x` satisfies several conditions: \(x > 3\), `x` is not divisible by 2, `x` is not divisible by 3, `x \geq 25`, and `(x \% i != 0 and x \% (i + 2) != 0)`. 

The code snippet increments `i` by 6. Since `i` was not defined in the initial state and there's no other context about its initial value, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 6`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), and `x` is not divisible by 2 and `x` is not divisible by 3, and `x \geq 25\), and `(x \% (i + 6) != 0 and x \% (i + 8) != 0)`, and `i` is increased by 6.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\) and `x` is not divisible by 2 and `x` is not divisible by 3 and `x \geq 25\) and `(x \% (i + 6) != 0 and x \% (i + 8) != 0)` and `i` is increased by 6.**
