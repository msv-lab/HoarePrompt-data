Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while i * i <= x:`. This means the loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. The loop body checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 6.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `x` remains unchanged unless the function returns `False`.
- **Variable `i`**: Increases by 6 in each iteration as long as the loop condition holds.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x` and ensures that `x` is not divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. The value of `i` starts at 5 and increases by 6 each time the loop runs. After the loop terminates, `i` will be the smallest number such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) > x`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided output states, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration: `x` is not divisible by 2, 3, and \(x \geq 25\), and `i` is 11.
- After 2 iterations: `x` is not divisible by 2, 3, and \(x \geq 25\), and `i` is 17.
- After 3 iterations: `x` is not divisible by 2, 3, and \(x \geq 25\), and `i` is such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) > x\).

### Final Analysis
Since the loop increments `i` by 6 and stops when `i * i > x`, the final value of `i` will be the smallest number such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) > x\). This means `i` will be slightly more than \(\sqrt{x}\).

Given the invariant conditions and the loop behavior, the final output state after the loop finishes executing is:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\).
- `i` is the smallest number such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) > x\).

### Final Output State
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\); `i` is the smallest number such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) > x\).**
