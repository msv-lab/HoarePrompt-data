The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial condition is that `1 < x \leq 1000`, `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and `x \geq 25`. The value of `i` is adjusted such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x`. The function does not return anything if the conditions `x % i == 0` or `x % (i + 2) == 0` are not met. Since the code only increments `i` by 6 and does not check the conditions or return any value, the output state remains the same in terms of the conditions for `x` and `i`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), `x` is not divisible by 2 and 3, and \(x \geq 25\); `i` is adjusted such that \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq x\); `i` is increased by 6.**
