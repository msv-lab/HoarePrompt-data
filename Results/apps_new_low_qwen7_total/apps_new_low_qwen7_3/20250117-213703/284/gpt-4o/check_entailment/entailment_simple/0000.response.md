### Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements a function `func_1` to check whether a number is prime. The function works as follows:

1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
2. If the number is 2 or 3, it is prime.
3. If the number is even or divisible by 3, it is not prime.
4. For larger numbers, the function checks divisibility by all integers of the form \(6k \pm 1\) up to the square root of the number.

The main program:
- Takes an integer `n` as input.
- Iterates over values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
- Checks if \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not a prime using the `func_1` function.
- Prints the value of `m` and breaks the loop when a non-prime number is found.

Given that the problem guarantees there is always at least one `m` within the specified range such that \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not a prime, the program is designed to find and print such an `m`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic of the `func_1` function is correct and follows standard prime-checking algorithms.
- The main loop will eventually find an `m` that makes \(n \cdot m + 1\) not prime, given the problem constraints.
- The program will terminate with a valid `m` as required.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic needed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis for any given `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
