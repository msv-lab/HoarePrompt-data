You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

- Program:
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range of 1 to 1000. It returns `False` for all values of `x` except when `x` is 1000. For `x` = 1000, the function returns `True`. The function checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, 3, or if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` in these cases. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks divisibility up to the square root of `x` using a while loop, returning `False` if `x` is divisible by any number of the form `i` or `i + 2` where `i` starts from 5 and increments by 6. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find an integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, given `n` as input. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `m`**: It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Check Function**: For each value of `m`, it calls a function `func_1` to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number.
4. **Output and Break**: If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The function `func_1` checks if a number `x` is prime by:
- Returning `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
- Returning `True` for numbers 2 and 3.
- Eliminating even numbers and multiples of 3.
- Checking divisibility for potential factors up to the square root of `x`.

Given that the problem guarantees the existence of such an `m` within the specified range, the program should correctly find and output a valid `m` for any valid `n`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The loop ensures all possible values of `m` are checked until a non-prime `n * m + 1` is found.
- The prime checking function `func_1` is implemented correctly according to standard prime-checking algorithms.
- The program handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, the program should correctly find and output a valid `m` for any given `n` within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
