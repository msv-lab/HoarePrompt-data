Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, given \( n \). The program iterates through possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, checking if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime using the function `func_1`. Once a non-prime value is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a number is prime:
- It returns `False` for numbers 1 and 3.
- It returns `False` for even numbers and multiples of 3.
- It performs a more detailed check using a while loop for numbers greater than 3, ensuring no divisors are found up to the square root of \( x \).

Given this logic, the program should correctly identify an appropriate \( m \) for any \( n \) within the specified range, as long as there exists such an \( m \).

Since the program follows the correct logic and the execution summary confirms the behavior of `func_1`, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
