Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find an integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, given `n` as input. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `m`**: It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Check Function**: For each value of `m`, it calls a function `func_1` to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number.
4. **Output and Break**: If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The function `func_1` checks if a number `x` is prime by:
- Returning `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
- Returning `True` for numbers 2 and 3.
- Eliminating even numbers and multiples of 3.
- Checking divisibility for potential factors up to the square root of `x`.

Given that the problem guarantees the existence of such an `m` within the specified range, the program should correctly find and output a valid `m` for any valid `n`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The loop ensures all possible values of `m` are checked until a non-prime `n * m + 1` is found.
- The prime checking function `func_1` is implemented correctly according to standard prime-checking algorithms.
- The program handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

Based on this analysis, the program should correctly find and output a valid `m` for any given `n` within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
