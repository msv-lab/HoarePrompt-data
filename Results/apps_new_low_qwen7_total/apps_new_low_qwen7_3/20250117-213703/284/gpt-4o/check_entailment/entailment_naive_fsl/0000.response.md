Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given \( n \). The program checks each \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses the `func_1` function to determine if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. If such an \( m \) is found, it prints the value of \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. The `func_1` function correctly implements a primality test, ensuring that the program works as intended for all given \( n \) within the specified range. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and guarantees finding a valid \( m \), the correctness is **True**.
