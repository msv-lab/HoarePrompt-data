### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function `func_1` to verify the original assessment.

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `m`**: The loop iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Check Function**: For each value of `m`, the program calls the function `func_1` to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number.
4. **Output and Break**: If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

Now, let's examine the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test using the following steps:
  - Returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
  - Returns `True` for the numbers 2 and 3.
  - Eliminates even numbers and multiples of 3.
  - Uses a loop to check for factors of the form `i` and `i + 2` up to the square root of `x`.

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Guaranteed Existence of a Counterexample**: The problem states that for any `n`, there exists an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. This is a critical aspect.
2. **Range of `m`**: The loop checks `m` from 1 to 1000. Given the problem constraints, this range is sufficient to find a counterexample.

Let's verify the correctness by considering the following points:

- For `n = 3`, we need to find an `m` such that `3 * m + 1` is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly identifies that `3 * 1 + 1 = 4` is not a prime number.
- For `n = 4`, we need to find an `m` such that `4 * m + 1` is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly identifies that `4 * 2 + 1 = 9` is not a prime number.

Given the function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers and the loop ensures all `m` values are checked, the program should indeed find a valid `m` for any given `n`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the logic and correctness of the program. The program and the function `func_1` work as intended, ensuring that a valid `m` is found for any given `n`.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
