### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
   
2. **Loop Over Possible Values of `m`:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
   - For each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1` and checks if this value is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.
   - If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, the program prints `m` and exits the loop.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if a number `x` is prime.
   - It first checks if `x` is less than or equal to 1, 2, or 3.
   - Then it checks if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3.
   - Finally, it performs a more detailed check using a while loop, checking divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i + 2` up to the square root of `x`.

Now let's consider the logic and ensure the program works as expected:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For small values of `n`, the program should find a counterexample.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers, so the program should work as intended.

- **Detailed Analysis:**
  - If `n = 3`, the program checks `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`. Since `4` is not prime, it prints `1`.
  - If `n = 4`, the program checks `4 * 1 + 1 = 5`, but since `5` is prime, it continues. Checking `4 * 2 + 1 = 9`, which is not prime, the program prints `2`.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies that `9` is not a prime number because `9 % 3 == 0`.

Given that the function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test and the main program iterates over possible values of `m` until it finds a non-prime, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
