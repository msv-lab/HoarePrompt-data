Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding a value of \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.
2. The annotated program correctly implements a primality test function, `func_1`, which determines whether a given number is prime or not.
3. The main loop iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, checking if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime by calling `func_1`.
4. When `func_1` returns `False` (indicating that the number is not prime), the corresponding \( m \) is printed and the loop breaks, ensuring that the program stops once a valid counterexample is found.
5. Given the constraints and the guaranteed existence of a valid \( m \) (1 ≤ \( m \) ≤ 1000), the program logic is sound and will always produce a correct output.

Therefore, the program is designed to meet the problem requirements accurately and will find a valid \( m \) for any given \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
