Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) such that each number contains at most \(k\) different digits, and then returning this sum modulo \(998244353\).
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly uses another function `count` to compute the difference between the counts of valid sequences up to \(r\) and up to \(l-1\). This approach ensures that we only consider numbers within the range \([l, r]\) that meet the criteria.
3. **Function `count`**: This function is designed to count the number of valid sequences (numbers) up to a given integer \(n\) that contain at most \(k\) different digits. It uses memoization to store previously computed results, which optimizes performance for large inputs.
4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The problem constraints are handled appropriately. The function `count` correctly deals with the case when \(k = 0\), returning 0 as there are no valid sequences.
   - The function `count` also correctly handles the case when \(n < 10^k\), directly setting the result to \(n\).
   - For larger \(n\), the function uses an efficient formula to compute the number of valid sequences, ensuring correctness.
5. **Modulo Operation**: Both functions ensure the results are taken modulo \(998244353\), which is necessary to prevent overflow and adhere to the problem's requirements.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the logical structure of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the provided specifications.
