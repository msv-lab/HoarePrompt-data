Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) such that each number contains at most \( k \) different digits. The program uses dynamic programming to count numbers with up to \( k \) different digits but does not sum these numbers as required.

For example, consider the input \( l = 10 \), \( r = 50 \), and \( k = 2 \):
- The numbers between 10 and 50 that contain at most 2 different digits are: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 55.
- The sum of these numbers is \( 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 39 + 44 + 45 + 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 55 = 550 \).
- However, the program will not sum these numbers; instead, it will count them and output the count modulo \( 998244353 \).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
