Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) such that each number contains at most \(k\) different digits, and the result should be returned modulo \(998244353\).
2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function takes \(l\), \(r\), and \(k\) as inputs.
   - It calls another function `count` to get the count of numbers up to \(r\) and up to \(l-1\), and then returns their difference modulo \(998244353\).
3. **Function 2 (`count`)**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently count the numbers with at most \(k\) different digits up to a given number \(n\).
   - It handles different cases:
     - If \(k = 0\), it returns 0.
     - If \((n, k)\) is already in the memoization dictionary `dp`, it returns the precomputed value.
     - Otherwise, it computes the count based on whether \(n\) is less than \(10^k\) or not.
     - The computation involves combinatorial formulas and ensures that the count is correctly computed and stored in `dp` for future use.

### Analysis:
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If \(l = r\), the function `func_1` returns 0, which is correct because there are no numbers in the range \(l\) to \(r\) to consider.
  - If \(k = 1\), the function correctly counts single-digit numbers.
- **General Case**: 
  - The dynamic programming approach in `count` ensures that numbers with at most \(k\) different digits are counted accurately.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range.
- **Correctness of Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(998244353\) ensures that large intermediate results do not overflow and the final result is within the specified range.

Given the logical structure and the detailed handling of edge cases, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
