Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

# Annotated Functions:
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(l, r, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}\), and k is an integer such that \(1 \le k \le 10\). Additionally, MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % 998244353
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the difference between the counts of valid sequences up to `r` and up to `l-1`, where each sequence is of length `k` and consists of digits. The counts are computed using dynamic programming (stored in the dictionary `dp`). The function returns this difference modulo 998244353. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly, but it assumes that `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`. If `l` were to equal `r`, the function would return 0 since the counts would be the same. There is no missing functionality mentioned in the annotations; however, the function implicitly handles the case where `l` equals `r` by returning 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a number, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary used for memoization, and MOD is a constant equal to 998244353.
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer representing a number, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization, and `MOD` is a constant equal to 998244353, where `k` is not equal to 0
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #The program returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer representing a number, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization, and `k` is not equal to 0, and the key (n, k) is not in the dictionary `dp`.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( n \geq 10^k \), `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10 \), and `dp[n, k]` is updated to \( 9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right]`.
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)

dp[n, k] %= MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing a number, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), the key (n, k) in `dp` is mapped to `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated to the value \(9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)\) modulo MOD.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[n, k]` which is either `n` if `n` is less than \(10^k\) or a computed value based on the formula \(9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)\) modulo MOD if `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), and `dp` (a dictionary used for memoization). It returns one of three possible values based on the input conditions:

- If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- If the key `(n, k)` is already present in the `dp` dictionary, the function returns the value stored at `dp[n, k]`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function computes a value based on the following logic:
  - If `n` is less than \(10^k\), the function sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), the function updates `dp[n, k]` using the formula:
    \[
    9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
    \]
  - Finally, the function returns `dp[n, k]` modulo \(998244353\).

The function uses memoization to store intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to optimize repeated calculations.
