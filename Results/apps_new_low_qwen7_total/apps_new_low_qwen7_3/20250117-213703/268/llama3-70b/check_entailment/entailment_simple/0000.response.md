Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) such that each number contains at most \(k\) different digits, and then taking the result modulo \(998244353\).
2. The annotated program uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute the count of numbers within the specified constraints.
3. Function `func_1` calculates the difference between the counts of numbers up to \(r\) and up to \(l-1\) and takes the result modulo \(998244353\).
4. Function `count` recursively computes the number of valid numbers up to a given number \(n\) with at most \(k\) different digits using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
5. The logic in `count` is sound and correctly handles both cases when \(n < 10^k\) and when \(n \ge 10^k\).

Given the explanation, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples. The logic and implementation align with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
