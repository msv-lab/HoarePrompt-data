You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):

    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), and `dp` (a dictionary used for memoization). It returns one of three possible values based on the input conditions:

- If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- If the key `(n, k)` is already present in the `dp` dictionary, the function returns the value stored at `dp[n, k]`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function computes a value based on the following logic:
  - If `n` is less than \(10^k\), the function sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), the function updates `dp[n, k]` using the formula:
    \[
    9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
    \]
  - Finally, the function returns `dp[n, k]` modulo \(998244353\).

The function uses memoization to store intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to optimize repeated calculations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the counts of numbers up to `r` and `l-1` that meet the criteria, and returns the result modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the count of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `k == 0`, returning 0 because no digits are allowed.
   - For larger values of `n`, it breaks down the problem by considering all possible combinations of digits and their positions, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.

3. **Key Steps in `count(n, k, dp)` Function:**
   - Initializes `dp` entries for small numbers directly.
   - For larger numbers, it calculates contributions from each digit position considering the constraints of `k` different digits.
   - Handles the boundary cases where `n` is a large number with more than `k` digits.

4. **Overall Logic in `func_1`:**
   - Calls `count` for `r` and `l-1`.
   - Subtracts these counts to get the count of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria.
   - Returns the difference modulo `998244353`.

### Verification:
- The logic in both functions seems correct and follows the problem requirements.
- The use of dynamic programming ensures efficient computation of the counts.
- The subtraction and modulo operations are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical correctness and the adherence to the problem statement, the provided Python program is correct.
