You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):

    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    if (n, k) in dp:
        return dp[n, k]
    if n < 10 ** k:
        dp[n, k] = n
    else:
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    return dp[n, k]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), and `dp` (a dictionary used for memoization). It returns one of three possible values based on the input conditions:

- If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- If the key `(n, k)` is already present in the `dp` dictionary, the function returns the value stored at `dp[n, k]`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function computes a value based on the following logic:
  - If `n` is less than \(10^k\), the function sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), the function updates `dp[n, k]` using the formula:
    \[
    9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
    \]
  - Finally, the function returns `dp[n, k]` modulo \(998244353\).

The function uses memoization to store intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to optimize repeated calculations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) such that each number contains at most \( k \) different digits. The program uses dynamic programming to count numbers with up to \( k \) different digits but does not sum these numbers as required.

For example, consider the input \( l = 10 \), \( r = 50 \), and \( k = 2 \):
- The numbers between 10 and 50 that contain at most 2 different digits are: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 55.
- The sum of these numbers is \( 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 39 + 44 + 45 + 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 55 = 550 \).
- However, the program will not sum these numbers; instead, it will count them and output the count modulo \( 998244353 \).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
