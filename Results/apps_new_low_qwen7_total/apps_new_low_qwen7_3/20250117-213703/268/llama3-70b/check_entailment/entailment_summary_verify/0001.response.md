### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) that contain at most \(k\) different digits, and the result should be returned modulo \(998244353\).
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum by finding the difference between the counts of numbers up to `r` and `l-1` that meet the criteria.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)` Analysis:**
   - The function `count` calculates the count of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `k == 0`, returning 0 because no digits are allowed.
   - For larger values of `n`, it breaks down the problem by considering all possible combinations of digits and their positions, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.

3. **Key Steps in `count(n, k, dp)` Function:**
   - Initializes `dp` entries for small numbers directly.
   - For larger numbers, it calculates contributions from each digit position considering the constraints of `k` different digits.
   - Handles the boundary cases where `n` is a large number with more than `k` digits.

4. **Overall Logic in `func_1`:**
   - Calls `count` for `r` and `l-1`.
   - Subtracts these counts to get the count of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria.
   - Returns the difference modulo `998244353`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in both functions seems correct and follows the problem requirements.
   - The use of dynamic programming ensures efficient computation of the counts.
   - The subtraction and modulo operations are correctly implemented.

However, there is a critical flaw in the `count` function that invalidates the solution. Specifically, the function `count` does not correctly compute the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits. The provided function `count` calculates the count of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with exactly `k` different digits, rather than at most `k` different digits. This discrepancy arises from the way the function handles the calculation for larger numbers, particularly the part where it sums contributions from each digit position.

### Example:
Consider the input `l = 10, r = 50, k = 2`. The correct answer should include numbers like `11, 22, 33, 44` (using one digit), and `12, 13, 14, ..., 19, 21, 23, 24, ..., 29, 31, 32, 34, ..., 39, 41, 42, 43, ..., 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59` (using two digits).

The provided `count` function will incorrectly exclude numbers like `12, 13, 14, ...` because it only considers exact `k` different digits.

### Conclusion:
Given that the `count` function does not correctly compute the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits, the overall logic of the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
