### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the sums of numbers up to `r` and `l-1` that meet the criteria, and returns the result modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the sum of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `k == 0`, returning 0 because no digits are allowed.
   - For larger values of `n`, it breaks down the problem by considering all possible combinations of digits and their positions, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.

3. **Key Steps in `count(n, k, dp)` Function:**
   - Initializes `dp` entries for small numbers directly.
   - For larger numbers, it calculates contributions from each digit position considering the constraints of `k` different digits.
   - Handles the boundary cases where `n` is a large number with more than `k` digits.

4. **Overall Logic in `func_1`:**
   - Calls `count` for `r` and `l-1`.
   - Subtracts these sums to get the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria.
   - Returns the difference modulo `998244353`.

### Verification:

1. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `k == 0`.
   - The recursive calculation for larger values of `n` seems to be correct in terms of considering all possible digit combinations.
   - However, there is a discrepancy in the implementation. The function `count` is designed to calculate the sum of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits, but it actually calculates the count of such numbers, not their sum. This means the function `count` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calls `count` for `r` and `l-1` and returns the difference modulo `998244353`.
   - However, since `count` is incorrectly calculating the count instead of the sum, `func_1` will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Given that the `count` function is incorrectly calculating the count instead of the sum, the overall logic of the program is flawed. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the misinterpretation of the `count` function, which should calculate the sum of numbers up to `n` with at most `k` different digits, not just the count.
