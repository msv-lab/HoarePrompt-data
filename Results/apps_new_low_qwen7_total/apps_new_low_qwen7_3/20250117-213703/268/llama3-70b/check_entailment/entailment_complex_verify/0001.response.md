### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)` Analysis:**
   - This function aims to count the numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `k == 0`, returning 0 because no digits are allowed.
   - For larger values of `n`, it considers all possible combinations of digits and their positions, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.

3. **Key Steps in `count(n, k, dp)` Function:**
   - Initializes `dp` entries for small numbers directly.
   - For larger numbers, it calculates contributions from each digit position, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.
   - Handles the boundary cases where `n` is a large number with more than `k` digits.

4. **Overall Logic in `func_1`:**
   - Calls `count` for `r` and `l-1`.
   - Subtracts these counts to get the count of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria.
   - Returns the difference modulo `998244353`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in both functions appears to be sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the `count` function when handling numbers with more than `k` digits. The formula used to compute the count of numbers with more than `k` digits is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example where `l = 101` and `r = 154` with `k = 2`.
     - The correct sum should include all numbers from `101` to `154` that have at most 2 different digits.
     - The given code incorrectly handles this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The function `count` tries to handle large numbers by breaking them into smaller parts, but the logic for calculating the count of numbers with more than `k` digits is flawed. Specifically, the formula used to compute the count of numbers with more than `k` digits is incorrect and does not correctly account for the problem constraints.

- For instance, in the example where `l = 101`, `r = 154`, and `k = 2`, the function incorrectly computes the count of numbers that do not have at most 2 different digits, leading to an incorrect final result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment overlooked the critical flaw in the `count` function, which incorrectly handles the calculation for numbers with more than `k` digits. Therefore, the given program is incorrect due to this fundamental flaw.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
