### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the counts of numbers up to `r` and `l-1` that meet the criteria, and returns the result modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the count of numbers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
   - It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `k == 0`, returning 0 because no digits are allowed.
   - For larger values of `n`, it breaks down the problem by considering all possible combinations of digits and their positions, ensuring the number does not exceed `n`.

3. **Key Steps in `count(n, k, dp)` Function:**
   - Initializes `dp` entries for small numbers directly.
   - For larger numbers, it calculates contributions from each digit position considering the constraints of `k` different digits.
   - Handles the boundary cases where `n` is a large number with more than `k` digits.

4. **Overall Logic in `func_1`:**
   - Calls `count` for `r` and `l-1`.
   - Subtracts these counts to get the count of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria.
   - Returns the difference modulo `998244353`.

### Verification:
- The logic in both functions seems correct and follows the problem requirements.
- The use of dynamic programming ensures efficient computation of the counts.
- The subtraction and modulo operations are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical correctness and the adherence to the problem statement, the provided Python program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
