The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the difference between the counts of valid sequences up to `r` and up to `l-1`, where each sequence is of length `k` and consists of digits. The counts are computed using dynamic programming (stored in the dictionary `dp`). The function returns this difference modulo 998244353. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly, but it assumes that `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`. If `l` were to equal `r`, the function would return 0 since the counts would be the same. There is no missing functionality mentioned in the annotations; however, the function implicitly handles the case where `l` equals `r` by returning 0.
