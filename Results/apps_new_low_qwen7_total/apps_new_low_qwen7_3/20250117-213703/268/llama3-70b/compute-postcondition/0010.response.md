To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the conditions necessary for the loop to start.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer representing a number.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
- `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization.
- The key `(n, k)` is in the dictionary `dp` with the value 9.
- `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\).

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, k)` will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `k`.

2. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 because the loop range is defined as `range(1, k)`.
   - `k` remains the same throughout the loop, as it is a constant for the duration of the loop.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be at least 1.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`: The value of `n` does not affect the loop condition directly but should remain consistent.
   - `k`: As mentioned, `k` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
   - `dp`: The dictionary `dp` and its contents do not influence the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the only condition that needs to be satisfied is that `i` must be at least 1. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, this condition is inherently met.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, n must be greater than or equal to \(10^k\)**
