The code `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3, and `k`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` remain unchanged, we can substitute the known value of `i` into the expression.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (3 - 1) = 10 ** 2 = 100`.
- `10 ** (k - i)` and `10 ** (i - 1)` are left as they are since `k` is not specified and thus cannot be simplified further without a specific value.
- The expression simplifies to `9 * 100 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is `dp[n, k] + 900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

Since `k` is unchanged, `10 ** (k - 3)` remains in its original form.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`**.
