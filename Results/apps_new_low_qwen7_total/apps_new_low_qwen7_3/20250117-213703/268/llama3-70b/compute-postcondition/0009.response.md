`dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `9`. The value of `n` remains an integer representing a number, `k` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10`, and `dp` remains a dictionary used for memoization. The key `(n, k)` is added to the dictionary `dp` with the value `9`. The condition that `k` is not equal to 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\) is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing a number, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary used for memoization, the key (n, k) is in the dictionary `dp` with the value 9, and n is greater than or equal to \(10^k\)**.
