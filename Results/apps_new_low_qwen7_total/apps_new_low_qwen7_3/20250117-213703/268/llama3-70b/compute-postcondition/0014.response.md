Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, k)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `k`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` remains unchanged
   - `n` remains unchanged
   - `dp[n, k]` is increased by `90`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - `k` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `dp[n, k]` was increased by `90` in the previous iteration, but since the value of `i` changes, `dp[n, k]` does not change in this step.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `k` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `dp[n, k]` remains unchanged**
