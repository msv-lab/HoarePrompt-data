Functionality: **The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)), and `dp` (a dictionary used for memoization). It returns one of three possible values based on the input conditions:

- If `k` is 0, the function returns 0.
- If the key `(n, k)` is already present in the `dp` dictionary, the function returns the value stored at `dp[n, k]`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function computes a value based on the following logic:
  - If `n` is less than \(10^k\), the function sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), the function updates `dp[n, k]` using the formula:
    \[
    9 \left[ (k-1) \cdot 10^{k-1} - \frac{10^2 - 10^{2(k-1)}}{99} \right] + 9 \cdot 10^{(k - 2)} \cdot (n // 10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
    \]
  - Finally, the function returns `dp[n, k]` modulo \(998244353\).

The function uses memoization to store intermediate results in the `dp` dictionary to optimize repeated calculations.**
