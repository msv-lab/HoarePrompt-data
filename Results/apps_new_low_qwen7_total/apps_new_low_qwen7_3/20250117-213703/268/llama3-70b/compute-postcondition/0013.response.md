The code updates `dp[n, k]` by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`, we can substitute this value into the equation.

First, calculate the expression:
- `i - 1` becomes `2 - 1 = 1`.
- `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
- `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** 1 = 10`.

So, the expression becomes:
\[ 9 * 10 ** 1 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10) \]

Thus, `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)` to its current value.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `dp[n, k]` is increased by `90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`**
