#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the length of n is sufficiently small to be converted to a string (in practice, n should be within a manageable range or handled appropriately for very large numbers).
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the length of the set of characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). It returns `True` if the length of the set of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the number `n` has at most `k` distinct digits. If `n` has more than `k` distinct digits, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is within a manageable range or appropriately handled for very large numbers, as stated in the initial comment.
- There are no explicit checks for invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n` or `k` outside the range 1 to 10. Therefore, the function may raise exceptions or produce unexpected results if these edge cases are not handled properly.
- The function does not account for leading zeros in the integer `n`, which might affect the length of the set of unique characters if `n` is represented in a form that includes leading zeros (e.g., "00123" would have a set length of 3 instead of 4 without leading zeros).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it will either return `True` or `False` based on the condition described above.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and k are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The function func_1(num, k) returns True if the number num contains at most k different digits, and MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the sum of all `num` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(num, k)` is True, modulo 998244353, and `MOD` remains 998244353.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is the sum of all num in the range [l, r] where func_1(num, k) is True, modulo 998244353
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and an additional integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)) that is referenced internally. The function returns the sum of all numbers in the range \([l, r]\) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). The function iterates through each number in the specified range, checks if the number meets the condition specified by `func_1(num, k)`, and if true, adds the number to `total_sum`. After completing the iteration, the function returns `total_sum`.

Potential edge cases include:
1. If `l > r`, the function should ideally handle this by returning 0 since no numbers are in the valid range.
2. If `l == r` and the number `l` (or `r`) does not satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, the function still returns 0.

The function does not explicitly handle these edge cases in the provided code, so the output in these scenarios should be 0.
