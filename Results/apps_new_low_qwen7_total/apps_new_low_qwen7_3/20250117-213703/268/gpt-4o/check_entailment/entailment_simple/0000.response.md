Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the given problem. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits. It does so by converting the number to a string, creating a set of its characters (digits), and checking if the size of this set is less than or equal to `k`. This function is used to filter out numbers that do not meet the criteria.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits. It iterates over each number in this range, uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition, and if so, adds it to `total_sum`. The result is returned modulo `998244353`.

3. **Main Program Logic**: 
   - The main part of the program reads the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` from the input.
   - It calls `func_2(l, r, k)` to compute the required sum.
   - It prints the result, which is the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the implementation seems to accurately solve the problem. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the code.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
