Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

### Analysis of `func_1(n, k)`:
- **Function Purpose**: Determines if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
- **Implementation**: Converts `n` to a string and checks the length of the set of its characters.
- **Issue Identified**: The original assessment correctly pointed out that this approach fails to consider leading zeros. For example, `100` should be considered valid when `k = 1` because it contains only the digit `1`, but the current implementation treats it as invalid because it has three digits.

### Analysis of `func_2(l, r, k)`:
- **Function Purpose**: Calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, and returns this sum modulo `998244353`.
- **Implementation**:
  - Initializes `total_sum` to `0`.
  - Iterates over the range `[l, r]` and checks each number with `func_1(num, k)`.
  - If `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the result modulo `998244353`.

### Test Case: `l = 100`, `r = 101`, `k = 1`
- **Expected Output**: `101` (since both `100` and `101` should be included in the sum as they contain only one unique digit).
- **Current Behavior**: The current implementation will only include `101` in the sum, as `100` is treated as having three digits (`1`, `0`, `0`).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation of `func_1(n, k)` fails to handle leading zeros correctly. The program indeed produces incorrect results for some edge cases, specifically those involving numbers with leading zeros.

Given the above analysis, we must conclude that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
