You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 998244353
(l, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(l, r, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the length of n is sufficiently small to be converted to a string (in practice, n should be within a manageable range or handled appropriately for very large numbers).
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the length of the set of characters in the string representation of 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, and k are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The function func_1(num, k) returns True if the number num contains at most k different digits, and MOD is defined as 998244353.
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the sum of all `num` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(num, k)` is True, modulo 998244353, and `MOD` remains 998244353.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is the sum of all num in the range [l, r] where func_1(num, k) is True, modulo 998244353




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to verify that it follows the problem description accurately and computes the required sum correctly under the given constraints.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a number has at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, then to a set of its characters, and finally checks the length of the set against `k`.
   - The logic is correct for determining if a number has at most `k` different digits.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive.
   - For each number, it uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is met, the number is added to `total_sum`.
   - The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the specified limit.
   - The loop iterates through all numbers in the range, including both endpoints `l` and `r`.

Given that the problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` where each number contains at most `k` different digits, and the program correctly implements this logic by checking each number in the range and adding it to the sum if it meets the criteria, the program should work as intended.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description.
