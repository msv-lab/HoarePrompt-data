Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, creating a set of its characters, and checking the length of this set.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function iterates over all numbers from `l` to `r` inclusive, uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the criteria, and sums up those that do, taking the result modulo `998244353`. The logic here is sound and should correctly implement the problem's requirements.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `l > r` implicitly by iterating only if `l <= r`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l == r` and checks if `l` (or `r`) satisfies `func_1(num, k)` before adding to the sum.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds, which is important for large inputs.
5. **Input Validation**: While the functions do not explicitly validate that `l` and `r` are integers or that `k` is within the specified range, the problem description assumes valid inputs, so this is acceptable.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided functions correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
