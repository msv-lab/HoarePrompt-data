### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to validate the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string and then checking the length of the set of its characters.
   - This approach correctly identifies if a number has at most `k` unique digits, including handling numbers with leading zeros.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates over each number from `l` to `r` inclusive.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is met, it adds the number to `total_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of all valid numbers modulo `998244353`.

Given the problem description, the key requirement is to ensure that the numbers from `l` to `r` contain at most `k` different digits. The provided function `func_1` correctly handles this by considering the number as a string and counting unique characters.

The original assessment suggested that the program does not handle the condition correctly for certain cases, particularly for numbers like `100` when `k = 1`. However, upon closer inspection, the `func_1` function indeed treats `100` as a valid number because it contains only one unique digit (`1`).

The original assessment made an error in its reasoning. The program correctly checks for the presence of at most `k` unique digits, including handling numbers with leading zeros.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Final**: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summaries. The function `func_1` correctly identifies numbers with at most `k` unique digits, and `func_2` correctly sums these numbers within the specified range and modulus.
