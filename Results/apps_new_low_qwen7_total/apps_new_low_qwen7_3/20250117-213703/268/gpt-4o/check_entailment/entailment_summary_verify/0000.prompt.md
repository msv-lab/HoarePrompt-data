You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
    return total_sum



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and an additional integer `k` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)) that is referenced internally. The function returns the sum of all numbers in the range \([l, r]\) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\). The function iterates through each number in the specified range, checks if the number meets the condition specified by `func_1(num, k)`, and if true, adds the number to `total_sum`. After completing the iteration, the function returns `total_sum`.

Potential edge cases include:
1. If `l > r`, the function should ideally handle this by returning 0 since no numbers are in the valid range.
2. If `l == r` and the number `l` (or `r`) does not satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, the function still returns 0.

The function does not explicitly handle these edge cases in the provided code, so the output in these scenarios should be 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the condition correctly for certain cases. Specifically, it checks if a number contains at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string and checking the length of the set of its characters. However, this approach fails to consider leading zeros. For example, the number `100` should be considered valid when `k = 1` because it contains only the digit `1`, but the current implementation treats it as invalid because it has three digits.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `l = 100`, `r = 101`, `k = 1`

The expected output should be `101` because both `100` and `101` contain only one unique digit, and their sum is `101`.

However, the current program will not include `100` in the sum, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
