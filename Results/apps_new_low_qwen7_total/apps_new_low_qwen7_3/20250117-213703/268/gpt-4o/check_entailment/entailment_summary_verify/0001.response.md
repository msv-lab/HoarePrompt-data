### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description, the given functions, and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if the number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
   - It works by converting the number to a string, then to a set of its characters, and checking the length of the set.
   - This logic is correct and will accurately determine if a number has at most `k` different digits.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2(l, r, k)` iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - For each number, it uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is met, the number is added to `total_sum`.
   - The sum is taken modulo `998244353` to ensure it fits within the required range.
   - The function iterates through all numbers in the specified range, ensuring that even the endpoint `r` is included in the summation.

### Edge Cases:
- **If `l > r`**: The original assessment did not explicitly mention handling this case, but logically, if `l > r`, there are no numbers in the range `[l, r]`, and thus the sum should be `0`.
- **If `l == r` and the number does not meet the condition**: The original assessment noted that the function would return `0` in such a case, which is correct because no numbers in the range `[l, r]` exist, hence the sum is `0`.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_2` assumes that `l` and `r` are within the valid range \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\). However, there is no explicit check for invalid input like `l > r`. The function should handle such cases by returning `0` if `l > r`.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
- However, the function does not handle the edge case where `l > r`, which could lead to incorrect results if not explicitly handled.

Since the function does not handle the edge case where `l > r`, the program is not fully correct as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is almost correct but fails to handle the edge case where `l > r`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
