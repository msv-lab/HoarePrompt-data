### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the number `n` has at most `k` distinct digits by converting `n` to a string and calculating the length of the set of its characters.
   - The function works correctly for most cases, but it indeed fails to consider leading zeros. For example, the number `100` is incorrectly treated as having three digits instead of one.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` iterates over the range `[l, r]` and sums up the numbers that pass the `func_1` check.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the sum does not overflow, and the function returns the correct result modulo `998244353`.

Given the original assessment, it correctly pointed out that the program fails to handle leading zeros, which can cause incorrect results for certain inputs.

To verify this, let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:

- **Test Case:**
  - Input: `l = 100`, `r = 101`, `k = 1`
  - Expected Output: `101` (since both `100` and `101` should be included)
  - Actual Output with Current Program: `101` is not included in the sum because `100` is treated as having three digits.

Since the original assessment correctly identified the issue and the program does not handle leading zeros, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle numbers with leading zeros, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
