Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if a number `n` has at most `k` different digits by converting `n` to a string, then to a set of its characters, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This logic is sound and correctly implements the requirement of counting distinct digits.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive.
   - For each number, it calls `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is met, the number is added to `total_sum`.
   - The use of the modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that the result is computed correctly without overflow, adhering to the problem's constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment did not explicitly mention handling the case where `l > r`, which should indeed return 0. However, the function does not explicitly handle this scenario. In the absence of specific instructions to handle this, we can assume that the input validation (ensuring `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`) should prevent this from occurring.
   - The original assessment also did not mention the handling of leading zeros, which is a minor concern because the problem description states that the input values are valid integers within the specified ranges.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly follows the problem description and computes the required sum modulo \(998244353\).
   - The logic in both functions is implemented correctly and efficiently.

Given the thorough analysis and the correctness of the implemented logic, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
