Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function correctly determines whether a given number `n` has at most `k` different digits. It uses the `set` function to find the unique digits in the number's string representation.
   - The function works well for the problem as it ensures that numbers with more than `k` distinct digits are excluded from the sum calculation.
   - However, as mentioned in the potential edge cases, there is no handling for non-integer inputs or out-of-range `k` values. This could lead to issues in a broader context, but within the scope of the given problem and the provided test cases, this is not a critical issue.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - It iterates over the range and uses `func_1` to check each number.
   - The sum is computed correctly, and the result is taken modulo `998244353`.
   - The function handles the case when `l` and `r` are equal, returning 0 if neither number meets the condition specified by `func_1(num, k)`.
   - The function does not handle the case when `l > r` directly, but in the context of the problem, this is not a valid scenario as the input constraints ensure \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\).

Given the problem constraints and the functions provided, the program logic appears to be correct and should meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
