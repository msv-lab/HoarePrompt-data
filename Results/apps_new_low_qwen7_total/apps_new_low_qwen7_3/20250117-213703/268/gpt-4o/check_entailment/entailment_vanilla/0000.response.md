Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to verify that it follows the problem description accurately and computes the required sum correctly under the given constraints.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a number has at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, then to a set of its characters, and finally checks the length of the set against `k`.
   - The logic is correct for determining if a number has at most `k` different digits.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive.
   - For each number, it uses `func_1` to check if the number meets the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is met, the number is added to `total_sum`.
   - The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the specified limit.
   - The loop iterates through all numbers in the range, including both endpoints `l` and `r`.

Given that the problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` where each number contains at most `k` different digits, and the program correctly implements this logic by checking each number in the range and adding it to the sum if it meets the criteria, the program should work as intended.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
