To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10\).
- `total_sum` is 0.
- `MOD` is defined as 998244353.
- The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for num in range(l, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Control Flow:**
   - The loop variable is `num`.
   - The loop will iterate starting from `l` up to `r`.

2. **Determine Initial Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(l, r + 1)` must contain at least one value.
   - This means that `l` should be less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Ensure the First Iteration Condition:**
   - In the first iteration, `num` will take the value `l`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `l` is within the specified range and `l` is the smallest integer in the range.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must be met:
- `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.
- The first value of `num` in the loop will be `l`.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the required state:

**State:**
- `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.
- `total_sum` remains 0 (since it does not affect the loop condition).
- `MOD` remains 998244353 (it is a constant and does not change the loop condition).

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is 0, `MOD` is 998244353**
