Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the sum of all `num` in the range `[l, r]` where `func_1(num, k)` is True, modulo 998244353, and `MOD` remains 998244353.**

### Analysis Breakdown:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each integer `num` in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. For each `num`, it checks whether `func_1(num, k)` returns True. If so, it updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to `total_sum` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **`total_sum`**: This variable accumulates the sum of `num` values that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, modulo `MOD`.
   - **`l`, `r`, `k`, and `MOD`**: These variables remain constant throughout the loop's execution. `l` and `r` define the range of iteration, `k` is used as an argument for `func_1`, and `MOD` is the modulus for all arithmetic operations within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute exactly once for each integer `num` in the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
   - The final value of `total_sum` will be the sum of all `num` values in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is True, modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop will terminate when `num` exceeds `r`.
   - The value of `total_sum` after the loop will be correctly calculated based on the given conditions and modulo operation.
   - Since `MOD` remains constant and does not change during the loop, its final value will still be 998244353.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has executed, the final state of the program will have `total_sum` as the sum of all integers `num` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is True, all modulo `998244353`. The variables `l`, `r`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.
