Postcondition: ***`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, and `MOD` remains 998244353.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that if the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The condition `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `MOD` remains unchanged in both the if and the absence of the else part. Thus, the overall postcondition reflects this update to `total_sum` under the condition `func_1(num, k)`.
