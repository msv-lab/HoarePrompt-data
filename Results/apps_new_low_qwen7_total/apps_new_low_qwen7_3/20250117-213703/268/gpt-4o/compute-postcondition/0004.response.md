Postcondition: ***`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is `num % 998244353`, and `MOD` remains 998244353. If the function `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True, `total_sum` is updated to `num % 998244353`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`.***
