Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
   - `MOD` remains 998244353.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`.

3. **Key Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `num`: This variable changes with each iteration.
   - `l`: This is the lower bound of the range.
   - `r`: This is the upper bound of the range.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they define the bounds of the range.
   - `num` increases by 1 with each iteration.
   - `total_sum` is updated by adding the current `num` to it and then taking modulo `MOD`.

6. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `num` was previously within the range `[l, r]`, the next value of `num` would be `num + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `num + 1` must still be within the range `[l, r]`.
   - Therefore, `l` must remain less than or equal to `r`, and `num` becomes `num + 1`.

### Final State:

- `l` remains the same.
- `r` remains the same.
- `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD`.
- `num` is now `num + 1`.

Given these adjustments, the new state can be described as follows:

**State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD`, and `num` is `num + 1`.**
