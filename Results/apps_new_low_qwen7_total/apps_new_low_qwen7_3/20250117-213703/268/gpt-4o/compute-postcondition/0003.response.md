`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Since `total_sum` is initially 0 and `MOD` is 998244353, the value of `total_sum` becomes `num % 998244353`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is `num % 998244353`, `MOD` remains 998244353, `num` and `k` are such that the function `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True.**
