The code initializes the variable `total_sum` to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state, and the function `func_1(num, k)` is not called, meaning its state does not affect `total_sum`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10; `total_sum` is 0; MOD is defined as 998244353.**
