Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- `total_sum` is `num % 998244353`
- `MOD` remains 998244353
- The function `func_1(num, k)` is evaluated for each `num` in the range `[l, r]`
- If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is updated to `num % 998244353`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for num in range(l, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is less than or equal to `r`
   - `total_sum` is `num % 998244353`
   - `MOD` remains 998244353

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `num` in the range, the loop body is executed, but the exact operations inside the loop body are not specified.
   - The key point is that the value of `total_sum` might change if `func_1(num, k)` is true.

4. **End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume the loop has just completed its execution for some `num` in the range.
   - `l` and `r` remain the same because they are not modified within the loop.
   - `total_sum` might have been updated if `func_1(num, k)` was true for the current `num`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `num`).
   - The new value of `num` will be checked against `l` and `r` to decide if the loop should continue.

### Updated State for the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `l` remains the same (no change)
- `r` remains the same (no change)
- `total_sum` will be the updated value if `func_1(num, k)` was true during the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains the same as the previous value.
- `MOD` remains 998244353 (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value or the previous value of `num % 998244353`, and `MOD` remains 998244353**
