The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\). Additionally, the function has an internal reference to `k`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function returns a single value `total_sum`, which is the sum of all `num` in the range \([l, r]\) where `func_1(num, k)` is True, modulo \(998244353\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r`, and return the sum of all numbers in the range \([l, r]\) that contain at most `k` different digits, modulo \(998244353\).
