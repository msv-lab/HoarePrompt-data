`total_sum` is updated to the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is the updated value, and `num` and `MOD` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, and `MOD` remains 998244353.

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, and `MOD` remains 998244353**
