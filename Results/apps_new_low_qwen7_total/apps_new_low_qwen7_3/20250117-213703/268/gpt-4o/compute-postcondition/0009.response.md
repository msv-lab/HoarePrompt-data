The code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD`, and `num` is `num + 1`.

1. The initial state is: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD`, and `num` is `num + 1`.
2. The code snippet changes the value of `total_sum` to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
3. Since `num` was `num + 1` before this line, the new value of `num` is `(num + 1)`.
4. Thus, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (num + 1 - 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

So, the output state is: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, and `num` is `(num + 1)`.

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `total_sum` is the updated value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, and `num` is `(num + 1)`**.
