The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It calculates and returns the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of `n`. The function achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and then iterating through each bit of `n` using a while loop. In each iteration, it checks the least significant bit of `n` by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1 (`n & 1`). If the result is 1, it increments the counter `count`. Subsequently, it right-shifts `n` by one bit (`n >>= 1`) to process the next bit. Once `n` becomes 0, indicating all bits have been processed, the function returns the value of `count`.

The function correctly handles the specified range of `n` and ensures that every bit in the binary representation of `n` is processed. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function will return 0 for `n = 0`, as expected. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns `count`, which represents the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.
