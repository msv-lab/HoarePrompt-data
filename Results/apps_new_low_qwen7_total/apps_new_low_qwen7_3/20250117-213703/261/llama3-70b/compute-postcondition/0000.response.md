The code initializes `n` to 1. The values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function `func_1(i)` is still defined as returning the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of integer `i`. 

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, `n` is 1, and the function `func_1(i)` returns the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of integer `i`.**
