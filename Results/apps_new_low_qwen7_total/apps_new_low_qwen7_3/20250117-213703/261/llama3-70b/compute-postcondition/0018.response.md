The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `m`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), and `k`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function also uses another function `func_1(i)` which returns the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of integer `i`.

Based on the output cases provided:

- **Case_1:** The function returns 1.
- **Case_2:** The function returns 2.
- **Case_3:** The function returns 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `m` and `k`, where `m` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 64\). The function returns either 1, 2, or 3 based on certain conditions related to the binary representations and counts of '1' bits in `m` and the relationship with `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `m` (an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It returns 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions involving the binary representation of `m` and the value of `k`.**
