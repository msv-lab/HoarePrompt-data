Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it will execute the first time.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while True:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The condition for the loop is `True`, which means the loop will always execute as long as the loop continues without encountering any break statements or other exit conditions.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\).
   - `n` is 1.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute the first time and every subsequent time unless explicitly exited.

### Conclusion:

Given that the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are necessary to the initial states of the variables (`m`, `k`, and `n`) to allow the loop to execute the first time. The loop will simply continue to execute indefinitely.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), and `n` is 1.**
