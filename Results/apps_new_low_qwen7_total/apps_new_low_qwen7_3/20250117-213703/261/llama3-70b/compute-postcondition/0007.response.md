The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the program state allows it to continue. Since there are no conditions checked within the loop itself (like in the previous examples), we don't need to adjust any specific variables based on the loop's head condition. However, since the loop will always execute, we should ensure that the state remains consistent with the given constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)
- `n` is 2
- `count` is 0 or 2 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(2)` and `func_1(3)` against `k`
- `count` is not equal to `m`

Since the loop will always execute and the only constraint involving `count` is that it must not be equal to `m`, and the values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged, the state does not need adjustment for the loop to proceed.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 2, `count` is 0 or 2 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(2)` and `func_1(3)` against `k`, and `count` is not equal to `m`**
