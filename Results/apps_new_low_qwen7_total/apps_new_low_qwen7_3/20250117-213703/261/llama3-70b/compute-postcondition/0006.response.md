The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 1, so after executing `n += 1`, the value of `n` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is 2; `count` is 0 or 2 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(2)` and `func_1(3)` against `k`; `count` is not equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is 2; `count` is 0 or 2 depending on the evaluation of `func_1(2)` and `func_1(3)` against `k`; `count` is not equal to `m`.**
