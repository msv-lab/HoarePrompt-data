Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 3, `count` is the number of times `func_1(i)` equals `k` for `i` in the range 4 to 7. If `count` equals `m`, the function returns 3. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, implying that the postcondition remains as the preconditions described.***
