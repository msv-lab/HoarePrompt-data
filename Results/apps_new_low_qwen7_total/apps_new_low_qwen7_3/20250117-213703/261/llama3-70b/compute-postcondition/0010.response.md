Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\), `n` is 2, `count` is the number of times `func_1(i)` equals `k` for `i` in the range 3 to 5. If `count` equals `m`, the function returns 2. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None).***
