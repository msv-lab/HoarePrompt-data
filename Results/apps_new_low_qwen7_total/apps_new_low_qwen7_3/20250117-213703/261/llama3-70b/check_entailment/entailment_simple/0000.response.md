### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a positive integer \( n \) such that there are exactly \( m \) numbers in the range \([n+1, 2n]\) whose binary representations contain exactly \( k \) ones.

2. **Given Functions**:
   - **`func_1(n)`**: This function counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \).
   - **`func_2(m, k)`**: This function finds the smallest \( n \) such that the number of integers \( i \) in the range \([n+1, 2n]\) with exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation is equal to \( m \).

3. **Loop in `func_2(m, k)`**:
   - The loop iterates over increasing values of \( n \) starting from 1.
   - For each \( n \), it counts how many numbers \( i \) in the range \([n+1, 2n]\) have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation using the `func_1` function.
   - If this count equals \( m \), it returns \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one solution for \( n \leq 10^{18} \).
   - The loop will eventually find such an \( n \) because the number of integers with \( k \) ones increases as \( n \) grows.

5. **Initial State**:
   - The initial state of the program before calling `func_2(m, k)` sets up \( m \) and \( k \) correctly.
   - `func_1` is called with integers \( i \) ranging from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \).

6. **Final State**:
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that once it finds an \( n \) that satisfies the condition, it returns \( n \).

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the required \( n \). The loop in `func_2` ensures that it iterates until it finds the correct \( n \) and returns it. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
