You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One day, after a difficult lecture a diligent student Sasha saw a graffitied desk in the classroom. She came closer and read: "Find such positive integer n, that among numbers n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2·n there are exactly m numbers which binary representation contains exactly k digits one".

The girl got interested in the task and she asked you to help her solve it. Sasha knows that you are afraid of large numbers, so she guaranteed that there is an answer that doesn't exceed 10^18.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers, m and k (0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18; 1 ≤ k ≤ 64).


-----Output-----

Print the required number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum((1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k))
        if count == m:
            return n
        n += 1



- Annotated Code: 
(m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(m, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18. The function func_1 calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        
        n >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is 0, count is the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original n.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original n (which is 0)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, and the function `func_1(i)` returns the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of integer i.
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)
        
        if count == m:
            return n
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is the smallest integer such that the number of integers `i` in the range `(n, 2*n]` where `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`; `count` is not explicitly defined as it is used within the loop to check the condition but is not stored after the loop.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a given integer `n`. It does this by iterating through each bit of `n` using bitwise operations.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to find an integer `n` such that exactly `m` numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation.
   - It starts with `n = 1` and increments `n` until it finds a suitable value.
   - For each `n`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` that have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation using the `func_1` function.
   - If this count matches `m`, it returns `n`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `n` starting from 1, which ensures that the solution will be found if it exists within the given constraints (up to \(10^{18}\)).
   - The use of `sum` with a generator expression in `func_2` correctly counts how many numbers in the specified range have the exact number of ones in their binary representation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (`m=0`) correctly, returning `1` as the output.
   - The logic ensures that only valid `n` values are returned, as it checks each incrementally.

5. **Output Validity**:
   - The output is within the specified range (1 to \(10^{18}\)), and the problem statement guarantees that there is always at least one valid `n` within this range.

Given these points, the program should work as intended for the problem statement provided.
