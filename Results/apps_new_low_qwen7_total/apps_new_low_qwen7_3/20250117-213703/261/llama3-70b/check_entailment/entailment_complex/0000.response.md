Reasoning:

- The problem requires finding a positive integer \( n \) such that in the range from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \), there are exactly \( m \) numbers whose binary representation contains exactly \( k \) ones. The given solution attempts to find such an \( n \) using the function `func_2`.

- The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer \( n \). This function iterates over the bits of \( n \) and counts the ones, which is correct and efficient given the constraints.

- The function `func_2` uses `func_1` to check how many numbers in the range \( (n+1, 2n] \) have exactly \( k \) ones in their binary representation. It increments \( n \) until it finds an \( n \) that satisfies the condition \( count == m \).

- The loop in `func_2` will eventually terminate because the maximum possible value of \( n \) is \( 10^{18} \), and the number of valid \( n \) values is finite due to the constraints on \( m \) and \( k \). Given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, the function should correctly find an \( n \).

- The logic in `func_2` is sound and follows the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly increments \( n \) and checks the condition using `func_1`.

- There are no apparent issues or logical flaws in the provided code. All parts of the program are consistent with the problem description and produce the correct output based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
