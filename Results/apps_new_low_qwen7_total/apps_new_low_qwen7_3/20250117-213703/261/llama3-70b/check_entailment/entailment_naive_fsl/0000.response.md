Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the required `n` such that among the numbers `n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2 * n` there are exactly `m` numbers whose binary representation contains exactly `k` digits one. 

The main issue lies in the `func_2` function, where the loop increment by `1` is too simplistic and does not ensure that the correct `n` is found within the constraints. Specifically, the function may take an extremely long time to find the correct `n`, or it may not find the correct `n` at all, especially for large values of `m`.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

For the input:
```
m = 3, k = 2
```

The expected output is `5` because among the numbers `6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12` (i.e., from `5 + 1` to `2 * 5`), the numbers `6 (110), 7 (111), 9 (1001)` have exactly 2 ones in their binary representation. However, the provided program might take an excessively long time to find this value, or it might not find it due to the simplistic increment approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee finding the correct `n` for every potential case within a reasonable time frame.
