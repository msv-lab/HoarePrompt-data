Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a given integer `n`.
   - It processes every bit of `n` and increments a counter for each 1 bit encountered.
   - The function works correctly within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find the smallest integer `n` such that exactly `m` numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation.
   - It iterates over possible values of `n`, counting the number of integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` that have exactly `k` ones using `func_1`.
   - If the count matches `m`, it returns `n`.
   - The loop will continue until the condition is met or `n` exceeds a practical limit (though theoretically it could go on indefinitely, the constraints suggest it will terminate within a feasible range).

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The main part of the program calls `func_2(m, k)` with the provided inputs.
   - The function `func_2` is designed to handle the problem statement correctly by finding the appropriate `n`.
   - Given the constraints and the logic of `func_2`, it should return a valid `n` within the specified range.

Given that both functions are implemented correctly and the overall logic of `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements, the program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
