### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of a given integer `n`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to iterate through each bit of `n`, counting '1's until `n` becomes 0.
   - The function is accurate and works within the specified range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find an integer `n` such that exactly `m` numbers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation.
   - It starts with `n = 1` and increments `n` until it finds a suitable value.
   - For each `n`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[n+1, 2*n]` that have exactly `k` ones in their binary representation using the `func_1` function.
   - If this count matches `m`, it returns `n`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `n` starting from 1, which ensures that the solution will be found if it exists within the given constraints (up to \(10^{18}\)).
   - The use of `sum` with a generator expression in `func_2` correctly counts how many numbers in the specified range have the exact number of ones in their binary representation.
   - The function ensures that only valid `n` values are returned, as it checks each incrementally.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (`m=0`) correctly, returning `1` as the output.
   - The logic ensures that only valid `n` values are returned, as it checks each incrementally.

5. **Output Validity**:
   - The output is within the specified range (1 to \(10^{18}\)), and the problem statement guarantees that there is always at least one valid `n` within this range.

Given these points, the original assessment seems to be correct. The program appears to handle the problem as described and the logic is sound.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
