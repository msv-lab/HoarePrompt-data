Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summaries step-by-step.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` counts the number of '1' bits (or the Hamming weight) in the binary representation of an integer `n`. This is implemented correctly using bitwise operations.

```python
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
```

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` is designed to find the smallest integer `n` such that among the numbers `n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2 * n`, there are exactly `m` numbers whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones. The function uses a simple incremental search starting from `n = 1`.

```python
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum((1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k))
        if count == m:
            return n
        n += 1
```

### Evaluation of the Function Summary

The provided function summary states that if no suitable `n` is found within a reasonable limit, the function will eventually return 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions. However, since the problem guarantees that there is always an answer within the constraint `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, the function should always return a valid `n` for any given `m` and `k`.

### Correctness of the Program

The program is indeed designed to work within the given constraints. Here are some key points that support the correctness:

1. **Binary Representation Check**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of a number.
2. **Incremental Search**: The function `func_2` uses an incremental search starting from `n = 1` and checks each subsequent `n` until it finds the correct value. Since the problem guarantees that there is always a solution, the loop will eventually terminate.
3. **Guaranteed Termination**: Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the loop will find the correct `n` for any valid `m` and `k` within the specified limits.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is overly pessimistic. The program does correctly implement the logic to find the required `n` such that among the numbers `n + 1, n + 2, ..., 2 * n` there are exactly `m` numbers whose binary representation contains exactly `k` ones. The function `func_2` ensures that it will find a valid `n` within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
