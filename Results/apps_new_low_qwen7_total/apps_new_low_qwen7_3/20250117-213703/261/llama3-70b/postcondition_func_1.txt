The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `m` (an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers `i` in the range `(n, 2*n]` where the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of `i` equals `k` is exactly `m`. If such an `n` is found, it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within a reasonable limit (as implied by the infinite loop which will eventually terminate due to the nature of `m` and `k`), the function will eventually return 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions involving the binary representation of `m` and the value of `k`, as defined by the return postconditions.
