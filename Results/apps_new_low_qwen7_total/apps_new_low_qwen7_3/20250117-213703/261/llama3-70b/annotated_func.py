#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18. The function func_1 calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        
        n >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is 0, count is the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original n.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original n (which is 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It calculates and returns the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of `n`. The function achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and then iterating through each bit of `n` using a while loop. In each iteration, it checks the least significant bit of `n` by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1 (`n & 1`). If the result is 1, it increments the counter `count`. Subsequently, it right-shifts `n` by one bit (`n >>= 1`) to process the next bit. Once `n` becomes 0, indicating all bits have been processed, the function returns the value of `count`.

The function correctly handles the specified range of `n` and ensures that every bit in the binary representation of `n` is processed. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function will return 0 for `n = 0`, as expected. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns `count`, which represents the total number of 1 bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 64, and the function `func_1(i)` returns the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of integer i.
def func_2(m, k):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = sum(1 for i in range(n + 1, 2 * n + 1) if func_1(i) == k)
        
        if count == m:
            return n
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\); `n` is the smallest integer such that the number of integers `i` in the range `(n, 2*n]` where `func_1(i) == k` equals `m`; `count` is not explicitly defined as it is used within the loop to check the condition but is not stored after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `m` (an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 64\)). It searches for the smallest integer `n` such that the number of integers `i` in the range `(n, 2*n]` where the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of `i` equals `k` is exactly `m`. If such an `n` is found, it returns `n`. If no such `n` is found within a reasonable limit (as implied by the infinite loop which will eventually terminate due to the nature of `m` and `k`), the function will eventually return 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions involving the binary representation of `m` and the value of `k`, as defined by the return postconditions.
