You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). The function processes the `trophies` string to identify segments of consecutive 'G' characters and calculates the maximum length of these segments. It then considers potential gaps of 2 between segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

Potential edge cases and actions performed:
- If there are no segments of 'G' characters (`segments` is empty), the function returns 0.
- If there is exactly one segment of 'G' characters, the function returns the length of this segment.
- For multiple segments, the function calculates the maximum length considering potential gaps of 2 between segments and returns the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

The function effectively finds the longest sequence of golden trophies, considering possible gaps of 2 between sequences, and ensures the result is within the bounds of the total length of the `trophies` string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes the data to separate the number of trophies and the string representing the trophies.
2. **Segment Identification**: The function `func_1` identifies contiguous segments of golden trophies and stores their start and end indices in the `segments` list. This part is implemented correctly.
3. **Initial Maximum Length Calculation**: The function calculates the initial maximum length of the segment of golden trophies without any swaps.
4. **Handling Single Segment**: If there is only one segment of golden trophies, the function returns its length directly. This is correct because no swaps are needed.
5. **Checking for Swaps**: For multiple segments, the function checks if swapping the first trophy of one segment with the last trophy of the previous segment can increase the length of the longest subsegment. This logic is implemented correctly.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are no golden trophies and single trophy scenarios appropriately.

Given the problem requirements and the implementation details, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
