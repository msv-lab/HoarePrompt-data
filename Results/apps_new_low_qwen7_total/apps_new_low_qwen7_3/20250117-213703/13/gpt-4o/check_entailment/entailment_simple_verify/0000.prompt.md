You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `segments` is a list of tuples, each representing a segment of consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. Each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive. The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The value of `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `trophies[i]` is 'G', the loop identifies a segment of consecutive 'G' characters and appends the corresponding segment to `segments`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', the loop simply increments `i` without modifying `segments`.

    #- `segments`: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters.

    #- `trophies`: A string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #Conditions:
    #- The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`.
    #- The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, but this case is excluded by the problem statement since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the golden trophies are split into multiple segments, and there is no golden trophy within 2 positions of another segment. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
8
GSGSGSGS
```

In this case, the program should check if there is a way to merge the segments by swapping trophies to maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. The program only checks if the distance between two segments is exactly 2, which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible swaps between segments and calculate the new length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies after each swap. The current implementation only considers swaps where the distance is exactly 2, which is insufficient.
