#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `segments` is a list of tuples, each representing a segment of consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. Each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive. The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The value of `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `trophies[i]` is 'G', the loop identifies a segment of consecutive 'G' characters and appends the corresponding segment to `segments`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', the loop simply increments `i` without modifying `segments`.
    #
    #Final Values:
    #- `segments`: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters.
    #- `i`: `n`.
    #- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
    #- `trophies`: A string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #Conditions:
    #- The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`.
    #- The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, but this case is excluded by the problem statement since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). The function processes the `trophies` string to identify segments of consecutive 'G' characters and calculates the maximum length of these segments. It then considers potential gaps of 2 between segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

Potential edge cases and actions performed:
- If there are no segments of 'G' characters (`segments` is empty), the function returns 0.
- If there is exactly one segment of 'G' characters, the function returns the length of this segment.
- For multiple segments, the function calculates the maximum length considering potential gaps of 2 between segments and returns the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

The function effectively finds the longest sequence of golden trophies, considering possible gaps of 2 between sequences, and ensures the result is within the bounds of the total length of the `trophies` string.
