The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy). The function processes the `trophies` string to identify segments of consecutive 'G' characters and calculates the maximum length of these segments. It then considers potential gaps of 2 between segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, the function returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

Potential edge cases and actions performed:
- If there are no segments of 'G' characters (`segments` is empty), the function returns 0.
- If there is exactly one segment of 'G' characters, the function returns the length of this segment.
- For multiple segments, the function calculates the maximum length considering potential gaps of 2 between segments and returns the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and the total length `n`.

The function effectively finds the longest sequence of golden trophies, considering possible gaps of 2 between sequences, and ensures the result is within the bounds of the total length of the `trophies` string.
