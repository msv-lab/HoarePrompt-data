`i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `0 + 1`, which is `1`. The other variables (`segments`, `n`, `start`, and `trophies[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, and the current value of `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
