`segments.append((start, i - 1))` appends a tuple to the `segments` list. The first element of the tuple is `start`, which is equal to the initial value of `i`. The second element of the tuple is `i - 1`. After this operation, the value of `i` will be updated to the next index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`, `i` is the next index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.**
