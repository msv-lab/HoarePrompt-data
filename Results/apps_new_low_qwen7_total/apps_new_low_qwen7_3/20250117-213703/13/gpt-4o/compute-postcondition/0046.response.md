Postcondition: **`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive; `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string; `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters; `max_length` is the maximum length of segments found; the length of `segments` is exactly 1**
