The variables in the loop head are `i` and `trophies[i]`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on both `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` has been increased by 1.
- `start` is equal to `i`.
- `trophies[start]` is 'G'.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
1. `i` is still less than `n`.
2. `trophies[i]` is 'G'.

Since `i` has already been incremented, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must still be 'G'.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `trophies[i]` must be 'G'.

State: **`i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'**
