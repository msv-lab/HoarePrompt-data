Postcondition: **`segments` is a list and `i` is an integer. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `segments` is [(`start`, `i - 1`)] where `start` is 1 and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2 if `trophies[1]` is not 'G' or the index+1 where `trophies[1]` is 'G' or `n` if all elements are not 'G', and `n` must be greater than `i`.**
