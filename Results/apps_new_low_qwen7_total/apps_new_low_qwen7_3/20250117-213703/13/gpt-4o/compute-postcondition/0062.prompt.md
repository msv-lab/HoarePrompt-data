Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive; `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string; `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters; `max_length` is the maximum length of segments found; `len(segments)` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(segments)):
    prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
    curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
    if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
        max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
            prev_start + 1) + 1)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *segments is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, i is 2, n is 1, trophies remains unchanged as a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, max_length is the maximum of its current value and `5 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1)`, len(segments) is greater than 1, prev_start is the start index of the (i-1)-th segment, prev_end is the end index of the (i-1)-th segment, curr_start is the start index of the i-th segment, curr_end is the end index of the i-th segment. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `5 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, `i` is 3, `prev_start` and `prev_end` refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 2, `curr_start` and `curr_end` refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 3, `trophies` remains unchanged. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and 10. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, `i` is 5, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`, if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
