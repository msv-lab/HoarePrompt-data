Postcondition: ***segments is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, i is 2, n is 1, trophies remains unchanged as a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, max_length is the maximum of its current value and `5 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1)`, len(segments) is greater than 1, prev_start is the start index of the (i-1)-th segment, prev_end is the end index of the (i-1)-th segment, curr_start is the start index of the i-th segment, curr_end is the end index of the i-th segment. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `5 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
