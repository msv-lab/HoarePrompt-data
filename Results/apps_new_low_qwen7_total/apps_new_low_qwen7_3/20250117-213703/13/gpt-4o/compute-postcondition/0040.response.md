Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`, `i` is the next index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the value of `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.***
