The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. 
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

Based on the output cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of segments found, and the length of `segments` is exactly 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of specific characteristics and return either 0, the maximum length of segments found with a segment length exactly of 1, or the minimum value between the maximum length of segments plus one and the total length `n`.
