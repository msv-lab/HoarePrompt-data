`segments` is an empty list, `i` is the index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' (or `n` if all elements are 'G'), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, and the current value of `trophies[i]` is the first non-'G' element or 'G' if all elements are 'G'. The code appends a tuple `(start, i - 1)` to the `segments` list. Since `start` is 0, the tuple added to `segments` is `(0, i - 1)`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `trophies[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`segments` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, `i` is the index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' (or `n` if all elements are 'G'), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, and the current value of `trophies[i]` is the first non-'G' element or 'G' if all elements are 'G'.**
