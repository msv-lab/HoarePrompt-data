Let's analyze the given Python loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
    i += 1
```
Initially, `i` is set to `start`, and `start` is equal to `i`. The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `n` and the element at index `i` in the list `trophies` is 'G'.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Variable `i`**: This variable is incremented inside the loop as long as the conditions are met.
- **Variable `start`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is only assigned once, and its value is `i` (which is the initial value of `i`).

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as both conditions (`i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`) are true. Once either of these conditions fails, the loop will terminate.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
After the loop terminates, the following conditions hold:
- `i` will be the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `start` remains the same as the initial value of `i`.

### Final Output State
- **Invariant Variables**: `start` remains constant.
- **Final Value of `i`**: `i` is the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`.
- **Final Value of `start`**: `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop has executed is:
Output State: **`i` is the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`; `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.**
