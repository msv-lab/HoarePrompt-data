`i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The condition that `i` is less than `n` still holds true. Additionally, the requirement that `trophies[i+1]` is 'G' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1; `trophies[i+1]` is 'G'**
