Postcondition: ***`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, where each tuple has the form `(start, end)`. The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The value of `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters. The list `segments` is non-empty.***

Explanation: The loop has processed the entire string, so `i` is now equal to `n`. Since the `if` condition checks if `segments` is empty and the postcondition must reflect that the `if` condition is true, we conclude that `segments` must be non-empty at this point.
