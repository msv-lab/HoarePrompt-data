The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 3, so after executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` is 4. The states of the other variables (`segments`, `n`, and `trophies[3]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`segments` is a list, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, and `trophies[3]` is 'G'**
