Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: segments is an empty list, i is 0, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if trophies[i] == 'G':
        start = i
        while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
            i += 1
        segments.append((start, i - 1))
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `segments` is a list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` remains an empty list and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `segments` contains one element, which is the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, and `i` is the index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `n` if all elements are 'G'. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `segments` is a list and `i` is an integer. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `segments` is [(`start`, `i - 1`)] where `start` is 1 and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2 if `trophies[1]` is not 'G' or the index+1 where `trophies[1]` is 'G' or `n` if all elements are not 'G', and `n` must be greater than `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is less than `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`, `i` is the next index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the value of `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
