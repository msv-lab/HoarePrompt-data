The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` must be less than `n` before the code execution, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will still be less than `n`. The condition `trophies[i]` must be 'G' remains unchanged because the code does not affect the `trophies` list.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
