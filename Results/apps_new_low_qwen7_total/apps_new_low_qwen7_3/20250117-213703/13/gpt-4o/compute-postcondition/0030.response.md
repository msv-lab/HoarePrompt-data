To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions inside the `while` loop.

Given the `while` loop:
```python
while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be true when the loop starts.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` must be less than `n`: This is already satisfied as per the given state.
   - `start` is equal to `i`: This is just a reference and doesn't affect the loop condition directly.

3. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - The second condition `trophies[i] == 'G'` must be true for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Since `i` is initialized to `start`, and `start` is equal to `i`, we need to ensure that `trophies[start] == 'G'`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `trophies[start] == 'G'` must be true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be less than `n`; `start` is equal to `i` and `trophies[start]` must be equal to 'G'**
