You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `segments` is a list of tuples, each representing a segment of consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. Each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive. The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The value of `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `trophies[i]` is 'G', the loop identifies a segment of consecutive 'G' characters and appends the corresponding segment to `segments`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', the loop simply increments `i` without modifying `segments`.
    #
    #Final Values:
    #- `segments`: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters.
    #- `i`: `n`.
    #- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
    #- `trophies`: A string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
    #
    #Conditions:
    #- The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`.
    #- The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, but this case is excluded by the problem statement since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive. `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters. `segments` is not an empty list.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns max_length which is the maximum length of segments found, and the length of 'segments' is exactly 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: `segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive; `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string; `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters; `max_length` is the maximum length of segments found; `len(segments)` is greater than 1.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, `i` is `len(segments)`, `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `max_length` is the maximum value among all segment lengths plus possible gaps of 2, `len(segments)` is unchanged, and `prev_start` and `prev_end` refer to the last segment's start and end indices. If any pair of segments had a gap of 2, `max_length` would be the maximum of its original value and the calculated new length. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. 
#- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
#- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
#
#Based on the output cases:
#- Case_1: The function returns 0.
#- Case_2: The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of segments found, and the length of `segments` is exactly 1.
#- Case_3: The function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of specific characteristics and return either 0, the maximum length of segments found with a segment length exactly of 1, or the minimum value between the maximum length of segments plus one and the total length `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns max_length which is the maximum length of segments found, and the length of 'segments' is exactly 1

Case_3: `The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
