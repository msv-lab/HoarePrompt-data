Postcondition: ***`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, `i` is 3, `prev_start` and `prev_end` refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 2, `curr_start` and `curr_end` refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 3, `trophies` remains unchanged. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and 10. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
