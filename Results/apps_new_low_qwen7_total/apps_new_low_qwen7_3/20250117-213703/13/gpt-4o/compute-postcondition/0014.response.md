Postcondition: **`segments` is a list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `segments` remains an empty list and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `segments` contains one element, which is the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, and `i` is the index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `n` if all elements are 'G'. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` must be greater than 0.**
