Output State: **segments is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, i is 5, prev_start and prev_end refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 3, curr_start and curr_end refer to the start and end indices of the segment at index 4, trophies remains unchanged, max_length remains unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the start and end indices of the segment at index `i - 1` (which is 3) to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. This doesn't change the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` but ensures they refer to the correct segment.
- The second line `curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]` assigns the start and end indices of the segment at index `i` (which is 4) to `curr_start` and `curr_end`, respectively. This updates `curr_start` and `curr_end` to refer to the correct segment.

No other variables are affected by these lines of code. Therefore, the segments list, `i`, and the values of `trophies` and `max_length` remain unchanged.
