Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is `i` is less than `n` and `trophies[i]` is 'G'.
3. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop header must be true.
   - The first condition `i < n` is already satisfied as per the given state.
   - The second condition `trophies[i] == 'G'` is also satisfied as per the given state.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since both conditions are already true, we need to move to the next iteration by incrementing `i` (assuming the loop body does not change `i` or `n`).
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` and `trophies[i]` is still 'G' for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - After the loop body executes, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming no other changes).
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` and `trophies[i]` must be 'G' for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state for the next iteration should be:
- `i` is less than `n` and `i+1` must be such that `trophies[i+1]` is 'G'.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is less than `n` and `i+1` must be such that `trophies[i+1]` is 'G'**
