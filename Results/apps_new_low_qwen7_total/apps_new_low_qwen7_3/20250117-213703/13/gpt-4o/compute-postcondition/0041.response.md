Output State: `segments` is a list of tuples, each representing a segment of consecutive 'G' characters in the `trophies` string. Each tuple in `segments` has the form `(start, end)` where `start` is the index of the first 'G' in the segment and `end` is the index of the last 'G' in the segment, inclusive. The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The value of `trophies` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.

The loop continues to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `trophies[i]` is 'G', the loop identifies a segment of consecutive 'G' characters and appends the corresponding segment to `segments`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', the loop simply increments `i` without modifying `segments`.

Final Values:
- `segments`: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters.
- `i`: `n`.
- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies`: A string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.

Conditions:
- The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, but this case is excluded by the problem statement since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
