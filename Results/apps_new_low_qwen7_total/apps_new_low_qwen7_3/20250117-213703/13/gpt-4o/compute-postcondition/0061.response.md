Postcondition: ***`segments` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive 'G' characters, `i` is 5, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`, if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
