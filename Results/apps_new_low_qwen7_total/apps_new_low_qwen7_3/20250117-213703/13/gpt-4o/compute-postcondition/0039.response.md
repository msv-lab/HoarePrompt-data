`i` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `i` must be less than `n`, and the value of `trophies[i]` is not 'G'. After incrementing `i`, this condition still holds as long as `i` was originally less than `n-1`. The value of `trophies[i]` is not guaranteed to remain the same because `i` has changed. However, we know it cannot be 'G' anymore since `i` has been incremented.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `n`, and the value of `trophies[i]` is not 'G'**
