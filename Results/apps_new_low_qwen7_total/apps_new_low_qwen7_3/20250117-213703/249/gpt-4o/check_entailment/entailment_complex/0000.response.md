Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and sets up the dynamic programming approach. The use of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays, along with `prefix_sum`, is appropriate for solving the problem using dynamic programming.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The logic for updating `dp_curr` based on the values in `dp_prev` through the prefix sum array `prefix_sum` is correct. This ensures that the state transitions are handled properly for each turn of the game.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The code handles the boundary conditions correctly by using the `max` and `min` functions to ensure that indices do not go out of bounds during the sliding window update.

4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is correctly calculated by iterating over the relevant range and summing the appropriate elements of `dp_prev`.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The use of the modulo operation (`% MOD`) is correct to handle large numbers and comply with the problem's requirement.

Given that the annotated program accurately reflects the problem's requirements and correctly implements the dynamic programming solution, the overall logic appears to be sound.

Correctness: **True**
