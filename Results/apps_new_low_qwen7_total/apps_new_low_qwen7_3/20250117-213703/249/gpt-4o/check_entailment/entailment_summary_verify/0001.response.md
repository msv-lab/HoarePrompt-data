### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Memory and Lexa start with scores \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
- Each turn, both can add an integer from \([-k, k]\) to their scores.
- The game has \(t\) turns.
- We need to find the number of games where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's.
- The result must be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values \(a\), \(b\), \(k\), and \(t\).
   - It calls `func_1(a, b, k, t)` to perform the necessary calculations.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - `max_diff` is calculated as \(2 \cdot k \cdot t\), representing the maximum possible difference between the two players' scores.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized as zero arrays of length \(2 \cdot max_diff + 1\).
   - `dp_prev` is initialized to represent the initial state where the score difference is \(a - b\).

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each turn, `dp_curr` is updated using prefix sums to efficiently compute the transition probabilities.
   - This involves computing the prefix sum array `prefix_sum` and then using it to update `dp_curr` within a specified sliding window.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After all turns, the result is computed as the sum of `dp_prev` entries corresponding to positive score differences (i.e., Memory's score is strictly higher than Lexa's).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` correctly uses dynamic programming to compute the number of games where Memory's score is strictly higher than Lexa's.
- It initializes `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays and updates them iteratively.
- It correctly handles the boundary conditions and uses prefix sums to efficiently update the DP table.

#### Verification:
1. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of `MOD` ensures results do not overflow, which is important for large values of \(t\).

2. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**:
   - The logic for updating `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` is correct and efficiently handles the range of score differences.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The range checks (`left` and `right`) ensure that index bounds are handled properly, preventing out-of-range errors.

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - Summing up `dp_prev` values from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff` is the correct approach to count games where Memory's score is strictly higher.

Given that the program follows the dynamic programming approach accurately and correctly implements the solution, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the original assessment is accurate.
