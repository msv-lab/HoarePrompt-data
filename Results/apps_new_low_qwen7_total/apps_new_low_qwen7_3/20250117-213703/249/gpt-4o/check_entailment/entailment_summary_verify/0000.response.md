Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to validate or challenge the original assessment.

### Analysis of the Problem Description and Code

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa after \(t\) turns.
   - Each player can get any integer in the range \([-k, k]\) in each turn.
   - The total number of possible games is \((2k+1)^{2t}\).
   - The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of games where Memory's final score is greater than Lexa's final score.
   - It initializes two DP arrays (`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`) to store the counts of different score differences.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to update these DP arrays.
   - Finally, it accumulates the results for the valid range of score differences (from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`).

3. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - Initialize `max_diff = 2 * k * t`.
   - Initialize `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` arrays.
   - Update `dp_prev` with the initial state (based on the initial score difference \(a - b\)).
   - For each turn, compute the prefix sums and use them to update `dp_curr` based on the possible score changes.
   - Swap `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` to prepare for the next iteration.
   - Accumulate the results for the valid range of score differences.

### Validation of the Original Assessment

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness: False**.
- Explanation: The transition logic in the `dp` array does not correctly account for the possible score changes in each turn. Specifically, the way the prefix sums are calculated and used to update the `dp_curr` array does not properly reflect the possible outcomes of adding or subtracting values from the range `[-k, k]`.

Upon re-evaluating the code and the function summary:

1. **Transition Logic**:
   - The `dp_prev` array is initialized with the initial state based on the initial score difference \(a - b\).
   - The `dp_curr` array is updated using the prefix sums, which accumulate the counts of possible score differences after each turn.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that all possible score changes within the range \([-k, k]\) are considered.
   - The final result is accumulated correctly for the valid range of score differences.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The boundaries are handled correctly by ensuring that the indices of `left` and `right` do not exceed the valid range of `dp_curr`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the initial setup and boundary conditions appropriately, ensuring that the dynamic programming approach works as intended.

### Conclusion

After thorough analysis, the provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution for the problem. The transition logic and boundary handling are implemented accurately, and the function summary matches the behavior of the code.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

Final: **True**
