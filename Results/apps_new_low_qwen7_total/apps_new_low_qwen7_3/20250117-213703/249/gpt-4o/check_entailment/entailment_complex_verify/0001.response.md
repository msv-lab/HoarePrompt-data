Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem statement and the given annotated code.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of games where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's final score.
- Both players start with scores `a` and `b` respectively.
- They play `t` turns, and each turn, they can add an integer from the range `[-k, k]` to their score.
- The total number of possible games is \((2k + 1)^{2t}\).
- The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7`
   - Input values `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` are read.
   - Function `func_1(a, b, k, t)` is called.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - `max_diff = 2 * k * t`
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized as lists of zeros with lengths `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` sets the initial state.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - A prefix sum array `prefix_sum` is used to efficiently compute the cumulative sum of `dp_prev`.
   - For each turn, `dp_curr` is updated using the prefix sum array to reflect the probability of score differences.
   - The arrays `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are swapped after each turn.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is calculated by summing up the values in `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - This sum represents the number of games where Memory's score is strictly higher than Lexa's score.

### Detailed Verification:
1. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of `MOD` ensures that the result does not overflow, which is important for large values of `t`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**:
   - The logic for updating `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` is correct. It handles the range of score differences and transitions over turns appropriately.
   - The sliding window approach using `prefix_sum` is efficient and correctly reflects the probability distribution of score differences.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The range checks (`left` and `right`) ensure that index bounds are handled properly, preventing out-of-range errors.

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - Summing up `dp_prev` values from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff` is the correct approach to count games where Memory's score is strictly higher.

### Edge Cases:
- The program assumes valid inputs within the specified ranges. If the inputs are invalid, the program will still execute but may produce incorrect results or errors.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to the problem. It follows the logical steps to calculate the number of games where Memory's score is strictly higher than Lexa's score, ensuring the result is computed accurately and efficiently.

Final: **True**
