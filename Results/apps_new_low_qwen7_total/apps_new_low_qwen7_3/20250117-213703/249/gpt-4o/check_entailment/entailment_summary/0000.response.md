Reasoning:

The given program appears to be a solution to the problem using dynamic programming. Here's an analysis of the key components and logic:

1. **Initialization and Parameters**:
   - The program correctly initializes the parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(k\), and \(t\) and uses them to define the maximum difference in scores (`max_diff`).
   - A DP approach is used to calculate the number of ways Memory can end with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Two arrays, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`, are initialized to store the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference after each turn.
   - The range of score differences is from \(-2kt\) to \(2kt\), centered around zero. This range is appropriate since the maximum score change per turn is \(\pm k\).

3. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - The `prefix_sum` array is used to efficiently compute the cumulative sum of `dp_prev`, which helps in updating `dp_curr` based on the sliding window of possible score changes.

4. **Sliding Window Update**:
   - For each turn, the program updates `dp_curr` using the values from `dp_prev` within a sliding window of size \(4k + 1\). This ensures that the current state depends only on the previous state, maintaining the correctness of the DP approach.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - After completing all turns, the program calculates the number of valid states where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's by summing the relevant entries in `dp_prev` (from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`).

Given the logical flow and the use of dynamic programming to correctly model the problem, the program seems to accurately implement the solution to the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the detailed analysis, the program is logically sound and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
