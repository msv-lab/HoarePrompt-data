### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement. We will also use the annotated code to validate the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the number of games where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's final score.
- Both players start with scores `a` and `b` respectively and play `t` turns.
- Each turn, a player can add an integer from the range `[-k, k]` to their score.
- The game has `(2k + 1)^(2t)` possible outcomes, but we are only interested in those where Memory's score is greater than Lexa's.

### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `MOD` to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Read input values `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`.
   - Call `func_1(a, b, k, t)`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - `max_diff` is set to `2 * k * t`, representing the maximum possible difference between the two players' scores.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized arrays to store the probability distribution of score differences after each turn.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - `dp_prev` is initially set based on the initial difference between Memory's and Lexa's scores (`a - b`).
   - For each turn, `dp_curr` is updated using prefix sums to efficiently compute the transition probabilities.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After all turns, the result is computed as the sum of `dp_prev` entries corresponding to positive score differences (since Memory needs to have a strictly higher score).

### Detailed Verification:

#### Initialization:
- `MOD` is correctly defined as \(10^9 + 7\).
- Input values `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` are read correctly.
- `func_1(a, b, k, t)` is called, which is a valid function call.

#### Dynamic Programming Setup:
- `max_diff` is calculated as `2 * k * t`, which correctly represents the range of possible score differences.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized as lists of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` correctly initializes the starting condition for the DP table.

#### DP Transition:
- The inner loops correctly update `dp_curr` using prefix sums. This ensures that the transition probabilities are computed efficiently.
- The boundary checks (`left` and `right`) are correctly implemented to handle the range of score differences.

#### Result Calculation:
- The final result is correctly computed as the sum of `dp_prev` entries from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`. This ensures that only the cases where Memory's score is strictly higher than Lexa's are counted.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed verification, the program follows the dynamic programming approach accurately and correctly implements the solution. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
