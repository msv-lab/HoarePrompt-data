You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Memory and his friend Lexa are competing to get higher score in one popular computer game. Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [ - k;k] (i.e. one integer among  - k,  - k + 1,  - k + 2, ...,  - 2,  - 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.

Memory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k + 1)^2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7. Please solve this problem for Memory.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7) in one line.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 2 1

Output
6

Input
1 1 1 2

Output
31

Input
2 12 3 1

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2. If Lexa picks  - 2, Memory can pick 0, 1, or 2 to win. If Lexa picks  - 1, Memory can pick 1 or 2 to win. If Lexa picks 0, Memory can pick 2 to win. If Lexa picks 1 or 2, Memory cannot win. Thus, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games in which Memory wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Transition Logic**: The transition logic in the `dp` array does not correctly account for the possible score changes in each turn. Specifically, the way the prefix sums are calculated and used to update the `dp_curr` array does not properly reflect the possible outcomes of adding or subtracting values from the range `[-k, k]`.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions are not handled correctly. For instance, when calculating `left` and `right`, the values might exceed the valid range, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, let's consider the first example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `k = 2`, `t = 1`
- Expected output: `6`

Let's manually calculate the possible outcomes:
- If Lexa picks `-2`, Memory can pick `0`, `1`, or `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `-1`, Memory can pick `1` or `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `0`, Memory can pick `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `1` or `2`, Memory cannot win.

So, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games where Memory wins.

However, running the provided program with these inputs gives an incorrect result. This indicates that the program's logic for updating the `dp` arrays is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
