Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes variables and sets up the DP tables (`dp_prev` and `dp_curr`). The state `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1` correctly represents the initial condition where no turns have been played yet.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: For each turn, the code updates the DP table `dp_curr` based on the prefix sums calculated from `dp_prev`. This ensures that we are considering all possible score differences after each turn. The range for `i` (the current score difference) is correctly handled, and the transitions between `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are correctly managed.

3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all turns, the code sums up the values in `dp_prev` from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff`, which represents the cases where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The entire computation is done under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

Given the detailed explanation of the program's logic and the correctness of each step, the program should correctly compute the number of games where Memory ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa.

Correctness: **True**
