Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Transition Logic**: The transition logic in the `dp` array does not correctly account for the possible score changes in each turn. Specifically, the way the prefix sums are calculated and used to update the `dp_curr` array does not properly reflect the possible outcomes of adding or subtracting values from the range `[-k, k]`.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions are not handled correctly. For instance, when calculating `left` and `right`, the values might exceed the valid range, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, let's consider the first example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `k = 2`, `t = 1`
- Expected output: `6`

Let's manually calculate the possible outcomes:
- If Lexa picks `-2`, Memory can pick `0`, `1`, or `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `-1`, Memory can pick `1` or `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `0`, Memory can pick `2` to win.
- If Lexa picks `1` or `2`, Memory cannot win.

So, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 possible games where Memory wins.

However, running the provided program with these inputs gives an incorrect result. This indicates that the program's logic for updating the `dp` arrays is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
