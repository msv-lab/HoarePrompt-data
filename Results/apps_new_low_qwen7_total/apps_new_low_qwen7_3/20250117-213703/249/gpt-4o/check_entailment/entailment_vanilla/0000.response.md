Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the number of games where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's final score.
- Both players start with scores `a` and `b` respectively and play `t` turns.
- Each turn, a player can add an integer from the range `[-k, k]` to their score.
- The game has `(2k + 1)^(2t)` possible outcomes, but we are only interested in those where Memory's score is greater than Lexa's.

### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set `MOD` to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Read input values `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`.
   - Call `func_1(a, b, k, t)`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - `max_diff` is set to `2 * k * t`, representing the maximum possible difference between the two players' scores.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are initialized arrays to store the probability distribution of score differences after each turn.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - `dp_prev` is initially set based on the initial difference between Memory's and Lexa's scores (`a - b`).
   - For each turn, `dp_curr` is updated using prefix sums to efficiently compute the transition probabilities.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After all turns, the result is computed as the sum of `dp_prev` entries corresponding to positive score differences (since Memory needs to have a strictly higher score).

### Detailed Verification:
1. **Modulo Operation**: The use of `MOD` ensures results do not overflow, which is crucial for large values of `t`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**:
   - The logic for updating `dp_curr` and `dp_prev` is correct. It correctly handles the range of score differences and transitions over turns.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The range checks (`left` and `right`) ensure that index bounds are handled properly, preventing out-of-range errors.

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - Summing up `dp_prev` values from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff` is the correct approach to count games where Memory's score is strictly higher.

Given that the program follows the dynamic programming approach accurately and correctly implements the solution, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
