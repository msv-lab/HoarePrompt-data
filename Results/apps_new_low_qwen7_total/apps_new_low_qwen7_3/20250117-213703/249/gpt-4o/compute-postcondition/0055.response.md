`result` is assigned the value of `(result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Here, the value of `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 1\), but the values of `result`, `dp_prev`, and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state. Since these values are not provided, we can only express `result` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`result` is `(result + dp_prev[max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 1\)**
