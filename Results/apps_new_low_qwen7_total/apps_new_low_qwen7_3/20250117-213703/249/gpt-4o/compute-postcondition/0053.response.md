The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `result`. Since no other operations are performed on any of the variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `result`.

Output State: **a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, max_diff is 2 * k * t, dp_prev is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, dp_curr is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, prefix_sum is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 3 where all elements are 0, `i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is max(0, 2 * `max_diff` - 2 * `k`), `right` is min(2 * `max_diff`, 2 * `max_diff`) + 1, `result` is 0**
