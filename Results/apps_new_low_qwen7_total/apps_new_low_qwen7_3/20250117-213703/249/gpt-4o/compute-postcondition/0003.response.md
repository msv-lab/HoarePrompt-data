Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop iterates over the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`, meaning the loop variable `i` will take on values from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Initial Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   For the loop to execute, the condition `i` in the range `0` to `2 * max_diff` must be valid. There are no additional conditions provided in the loop itself that affect the loop's execution other than the range.

3. **State of Variables at the Start of the Loop:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `k` are already defined and do not change within the loop.
   - `t` must be greater than 0, as mentioned.
   - `max_diff` is already calculated as `2 * k * t`.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` are lists of integers, and their initial states are provided.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros.

4. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i = 2 * max_diff`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` starts at `0`.

5. **State at the Start of the First Iteration:**
   - `i` must be `0` for the loop to start executing.
   - All other variables (`a`, `b`, `k`, `t`, `max_diff`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, `prefix_sum`) remain as initially defined.

Given this analysis, we can summarize the required state at the start of the first iteration of the loop:

**State:**
- `i` is **0**
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `max_diff` is \(2 * k * t\)
- `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length \(2 * max_diff + 1\) where all elements are 0 except for the element at index \(max_diff + (a - b)\) which is 1
- `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length \(2 * max_diff + 1\) where all elements are 0
- `prefix_sum` is a list of \(2 * max_diff + 3\) zeros

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is 2 * k * t, `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros**
