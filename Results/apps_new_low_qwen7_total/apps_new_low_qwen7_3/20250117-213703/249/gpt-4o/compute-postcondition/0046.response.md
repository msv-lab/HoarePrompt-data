Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is `max(0, -2 * k)`
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`
   - `dp_curr` is updated such that `dp_curr[0] = (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, -2 * k)]) % MOD`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr` do not change based on the loop iteration itself; they remain as they were from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `max(0, -2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_curr` is updated such that `dp_curr[0] = (prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, -2 * k)]) % MOD**
