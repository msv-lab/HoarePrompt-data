Output State: **a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, max_diff is 2 * k * t, dp_prev is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, dp_curr is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0**

Explanation:
1. `max_diff = 2 * k * t`: This line calculates the maximum difference and assigns it to `max_diff`.
2. `dp_prev = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)`: This line initializes `dp_prev` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 1`.
3. `dp_curr = [0] * (2 * max_diff + 1)`: This line initializes `dp_curr` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 1`.
4. `dp_prev[max_diff + (a - b)] = 1`: This line sets the value at the index `max_diff + (a - b)` in `dp_prev` to 1. Given the initial state, this index will contain the value 1, and all other elements in `dp_prev` will remain 0.
