Let's break down the state of the objects in the loop head to determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State Before Loop Starts:
- `i` is set to `2 * max_diff`
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `2 * max_diff + 1`
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within this range.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `2 * max_diff`, the loop will execute the first time when `i` becomes `0`.

2. **Variable `left` and `right`:**
   - These variables do not directly control the loop execution but are part of the state.
   - Their values (`left = 0` and `right = 2 * max_diff + 1`) do not affect the loop's first execution.

3. **Lists `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`:**
   - These lists are used for cumulative sums.
   - Their values do not affect the loop's first execution.

4. **List `prefix_sum`:**
   - This list is initialized as a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`.
   - Its value does not affect the loop's first execution.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be `0`. Given that `i` is initially set to `2 * max_diff`, we need to adjust the initial state such that `i` is `0` at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `i` must be `0`.
- `left` is `0`.
- `right` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums.
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums.
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`.

**State: **`i` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 2 * `max_diff` + 3**
