Output State: **i is 6, left is 2, right is 5, dp_curr is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, prefix_sum is a list or array**

Explanation:
1. The first line `left = max(0, i - 2 * k)` updates `left`. Given that `i` is 4 and assuming `k` is an integer (though `k` is not defined, we can infer it from the context), if `k` is a non-negative integer, then `left` becomes `max(0, 4 - 2 * k)`. For the sake of this example, let's assume `k` is 1 (a common small value for such problems), so `left` becomes `max(0, 4 - 2) = 2`.
2. The second line `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1` updates `right`. Assuming `max_diff` is also an integer and `k` is 1, if `max_diff` is 2 (a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement), then `right` becomes `min(2 * 2, 4 + 2 * 1) + 1 = min(4, 6) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.
3. The third line `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` updates `dp_curr[4]` with the value of `(prefix_sum[5] - prefix_sum[2]) % MOD`. However, since the exact content of `prefix_sum` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp_curr[4]`. The structure of `dp_curr` remains unchanged except for the new key-value pair at `i=4`.

Given the above steps, the final state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is updated to 6 (though it's not explicitly stated in the code, the calculation shows it should be 6 considering the increment in the range of `right`).
- `left` is set to 2.
- `right` is set to 5.
- `dp_curr` remains a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, and now includes a new key-value pair with key 4 and an unknown value derived from the difference in `prefix_sum` modulo `MOD`.
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged in terms of structure but might contain new elements if they were added during the computation.
