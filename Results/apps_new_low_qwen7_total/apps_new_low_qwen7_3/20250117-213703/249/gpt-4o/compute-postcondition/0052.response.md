Output State: **a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, max_diff is 2 * k * t, dp_prev is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, dp_curr is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, prefix_sum is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 3 where all elements are 0, `i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is max(0, 2 * `max_diff` - 2 * `k`), `right` is min(2 * `max_diff`, 2 * `max_diff`) + 1.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop runs `t` times. In each iteration, it updates `dp_curr` based on the previous state `dp_prev`. The initial state sets `dp_prev` to a specific configuration where only one element corresponds to `a - b`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` swap roles after each iteration.
   - `prefix_sum` is recalculated in each iteration but is reset to zero before the loop starts over.
   - `i` iterates from 0 to 2 * `max_diff` + 1.
   - `left` and `right` are calculated based on the current value of `i` and the boundaries set by `2 * k`.
   - `dp_curr[i]` is updated using the formula involving `prefix_sum`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After each full cycle of the outer loop (`t` iterations), `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will be fully updated based on the previous state.
   - The loop ensures that all elements in `dp_curr` are computed correctly for the range of `i` from 0 to 2 * `max_diff`.
   - The final state after `t` iterations will have `dp_prev` as the last `dp_curr` and `dp_curr` as all zeros since no new updates are made after the last iteration.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants are consistent with the provided output states. Each iteration updates `dp_curr` based on the cumulative sums in `prefix_sum`, ensuring that the final state reflects the correct updates after `t` iterations.

After the loop completes, `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` will both be lists of length 2 * `max_diff` + 1, where all elements are 0, as no further updates are made beyond the last iteration.
