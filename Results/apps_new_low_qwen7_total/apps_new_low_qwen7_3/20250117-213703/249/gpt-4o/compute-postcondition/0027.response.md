Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - Specifically, the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i = 2 * max_diff`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - Before entering the loop, `i` is set to \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\).

3. **First Iteration Check**:
   - The loop will execute the first time when `i` is incremented from \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

4. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, where `n` is `2 * max_diff + 1`.

5. **Condition for First Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be equal to `0`.
   - However, initially, `i` is set to \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\). Therefore, the loop needs to start with `i` being incremented from \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) to `0`.

6. **Adjusting the Initial State**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to `0`.

### Final State Before the First Execution of the Loop
- `i` should be `0` for the loop to execute the first time.
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they were initialized.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\).

### Output State
State: **`i` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)**
