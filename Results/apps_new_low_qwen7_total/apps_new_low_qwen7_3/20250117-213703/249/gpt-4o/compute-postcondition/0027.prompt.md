You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so these are the only ones that control whether the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head is variable students, index and list student_list so these are the only ones that can control if the loop will execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - For each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]`.

2. **Variables Remaining Constant**:
   - `left` remains 0 throughout the loop.
   - `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) throughout the loop.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they are initialized and are not modified within the loop.

3. **Tracking `prefix_sum`**:
   - Initially, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.

### Iteration Observations
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`):
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

- After the second iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `prefix_sum[2]` is \((prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[1]) \% MOD\).

- After the third iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\).

- This pattern continues up to the last iteration (`i = 2 * max_diff`).

### Final State Calculation
- The loop runs for `2 * max_diff + 1` times.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will have been updated for each index from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

### Final Values
- `i` will be \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) (since the loop runs `2 * max_diff + 1` times and starts from `0`).
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they were initialized.
- `prefix_sum` will have the updated values based on the loop's computation.

### Output State
- **Final `i`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- **Final `left`**: 0
- **Final `right`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- **Final `dp_prev`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `dp_curr`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `prefix_sum`**: A list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), where each element from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) is updated according to the loop's formula.

Output State: `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\); `left` is 0; `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\); `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\).
```
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execue the first time.
