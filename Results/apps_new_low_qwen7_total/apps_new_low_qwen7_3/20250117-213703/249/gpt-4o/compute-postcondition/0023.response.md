The code updates the `prefix_sum` array such that `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is set to `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, the initial value of `i` is 1, so we need to update `prefix_sum[2]` because `i + 1` equals 2.

The initial value of `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`. Since no other initial values for `dp_prev` are given, we only know `prefix_sum[1]`.

Thus, the calculation for `prefix_sum[2]` is:
\[ prefix_sum[2] = (prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD \]

Since `prefix_sum[1]` is known and `dp_prev[0]` is also part of the initial state, `prefix_sum[2]` can be calculated based on these values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[2]` is \((prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD\)**
