The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since it is a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful state (it is incremented automatically by the loop), we do not need to adjust any specific state related to it.

The loop condition for the `for _ in range(t):` statement is based on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state of `t` has not been modified within the loop body, so we assume `t` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given the provided information, no adjustments are needed for the states of `i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums**
