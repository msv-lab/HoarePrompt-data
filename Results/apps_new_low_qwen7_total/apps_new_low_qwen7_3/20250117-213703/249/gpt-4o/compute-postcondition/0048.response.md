Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `2 * max_diff + 1`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `2 * max_diff`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is 4
   - `dp_curr` is `[0, 4]`

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (since it increments by 1 each time).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 4, `dp_curr` is [0, 4]**
