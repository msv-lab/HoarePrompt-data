Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The loop will execute again if `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`.
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`.
   - `dp_curr` is undefined.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   Since the loop will execute again if `i < 2 * max_diff + 1`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Adjust Other Relevant States:**
   - `left` and `right` are determined by `k` and `max_diff`, so they remain unchanged.
   - `dp_prev` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `prefix_sum[1]` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `dp_curr` remains undefined as it was not defined or updated in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`, `dp_curr` is undefined**
