Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze and execute the code step by step to determine the final output state.

### Initial State
- `i` is 3
- `left` is 1
- `right` is 3
- `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7

### Code Snippet
```python
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Assign `left`**:
   - The value of `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
   - Since `i` is 3, `left` will be `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`.
   - Without the value of `k`, we cannot compute the exact value of `left`. However, we know that `left` will be adjusted based on this formula.

2. **Assign `right`**:
   - The value of `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 3, `right` will be `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - Again, without the value of `k` and `max_diff`, we cannot compute the exact value of `right`. However, we know that `right` will be adjusted based on this formula.

3. **Assign `dp_curr[i]`**:
   - The value of `dp_curr[i]` is set to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
   - Since `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, both `prefix_sum[left]` and `prefix_sum[right]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `dp_curr[i]` will be `(0 - 0) % MOD = 0`.

### Final Output State
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `left` and `right` are updated based on the formulas provided, but their exact values depend on the unknown values of `k` and `max_diff`.
- `dp_curr` at index 4 is set to 0.
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: i is 4, left is max(0, 3 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, its 4th element equal to 0, and all other elements equal to 0, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 7**
