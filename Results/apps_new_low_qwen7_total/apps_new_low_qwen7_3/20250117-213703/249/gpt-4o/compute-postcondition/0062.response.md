The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t`. The parameters `a`, `b`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Based on the provided output cases, the function does not specify a particular return value directly but rather describes conditions under which certain outputs might occur. However, following the given structure:

- Case_1: `a`, `b`, `k`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges. If a specific condition related to these parameters is met (though not explicitly stated here), the function would return a certain value or perform a specific action.

Since the exact output conditions are not detailed, the primary focus should be on the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, k, and t, where 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and returns a value based on unspecified conditions related to these parameters.**
