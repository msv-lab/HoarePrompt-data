Let's analyze the given code and the initial and output states step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range `2 * max_diff + 1`, updating the `prefix_sum` array. The key part of the loop is:
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```
This means each iteration updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the previous value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `a`, `b`, `k`, `t`, `max_diff`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`.
- **Variable `i`**: This variable changes linearly from 0 to `2 * max_diff`.
- **Variable `prefix_sum`**: This array gets updated in each iteration.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
Each iteration of the loop adds the value of `dp_prev[i]` to the cumulative sum stored in `prefix_sum`. Since `dp_prev` has only one non-zero element initially at index `max_diff + (a - b)` which is 1, and all other elements are 0, the updates to `prefix_sum` will propagate this value through the array.

After `2 * max_diff + 1` iterations, `prefix_sum` will be fully populated with cumulative sums starting from `prefix_sum[0]` up to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]`. Each `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will hold the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` up to index `i`.

### Verify Relationships
From the given output states, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `prefix_sum[1]` is 0.
- After 2 iterations, `prefix_sum[1]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is 1.
- After 3 iterations, `prefix_sum[1]` is 0, `prefix_sum[2]` is 1, and `prefix_sum[3]` is 1.

This pattern continues until all elements in `prefix_sum` are updated. Specifically, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `dp_prev` up to index `i`.

### Final Output State
After all iterations of the loop (which will be `2 * max_diff + 1` times), the `prefix_sum` array will be completely filled with cumulative sums. The final state will be:

Output State: **`i` is `2 * max_diff`, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is 2 * k * t, `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros where each element from `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2]` is a cumulative sum of `dp_prev` up to the corresponding index.**
