To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's follow the given steps methodically.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `2 * max_diff`. The key operations inside the loop are updating the `left`, `right`, and setting `dp_curr[i]` based on the `prefix_sum` array.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `max_diff` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `MOD` remains constant.
  - `prefix_sum` is updated based on the loop's operations but its structure and values are not provided explicitly, so we focus on how it influences the loop.
- **Variables Updated Inside the Loop**:
  - `left` and `right` are recalculated in each iteration.
  - `dp_curr[i]` is updated based on the difference between `prefix_sum[right]` and `prefix_sum[left]`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop starts with `i = 0` and increases `i` until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.
- For each `i`, `left` and `right` are computed based on the current `i` and `k`.
- `dp_curr[i]` is set to the value `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.

From the given outputs, we observe:
- After 1 iteration: `dp_curr[0]` is calculated as \((prefix_sum[min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, -2 * k)]) % MOD\).
- After 2 iterations: `dp_curr` becomes `[0, 4]`.
- After 3 iterations: `dp_curr` remains `[0, 4]`.

This suggests that once `dp_curr` reaches a stable state, it remains unchanged.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Since `dp_curr` stabilizes after 2 iterations, we can conclude that `dp_curr` will remain `[0, 4]` for any further iterations.

### Conclusion
After the loop completes, the values of the variables will be:
- `i` will be `2 * max_diff` because the loop iterates up to this point.
- `left` and `right` will be determined by the last value of `i` and `k`.
- `dp_curr` will be `[0, 4]` as it stabilizes early.

Output State: **i is 2 * max_diff, left is max(0, (2 * max_diff - 2 * k)), right is min(2 * max_diff, 2 * max_diff) + 1, dp_curr is [0, 4]**.
