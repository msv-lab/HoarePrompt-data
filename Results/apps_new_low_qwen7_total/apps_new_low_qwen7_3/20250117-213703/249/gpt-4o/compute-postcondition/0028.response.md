Output State: **i is 0, left is 0, right is 1, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to (prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 2 * max_diff + 3**

Explanation:
- The first line updates `left` to be the maximum of 0 and `i - 2 * k`. Given that `i` is 0, if `k` is a non-negative integer, `left` will be 0. If `k` is negative, `i - 2 * k` would be positive, but the maximum function ensures `left` is at least 0.
- The second line updates `right` to be the minimum of `2 * max_diff + 1` and `i + 2 * k` plus 1. Given that `i` is 0, `right` will be `1` because `2 * max_diff + 1` is larger than 1.
- The third line calculates `dp_curr[i]` using the formula `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this becomes `(prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`. The value of `prefix_sum[1]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[0]` is also 0, so `dp_curr[i]` becomes `0 % MOD`, which is 0. Note that `dp_curr` is initially a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, and here it is being updated at index `i`.

Thus, the final state includes the updated `left` and `right` values and the updated `dp_curr` at index `i`.
