The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_prev` holds the value of `dp_curr`, which is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, and `dp_curr` is also a list or array reflecting cumulative sums. After swapping, `dp_prev` will now hold the value of `dp_curr` before the swap, and `dp_curr` will hold the value of `dp_prev` before the swap.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- Before the swap, `dp_prev` is `dp_curr` (a list or array reflecting cumulative sums).
- Before the swap, `dp_curr` is `dp_curr` (a list or array reflecting cumulative sums).

After the swap:
- `dp_prev` becomes the original value of `dp_curr` (the list or array reflecting cumulative sums).
- `dp_curr` becomes the original value of `dp_prev` (the list or array reflecting cumulative sums).

Other variables (`left`, `right`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums**
