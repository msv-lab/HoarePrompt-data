Output State: **i is 3, left is 0, right is 3, dp_curr is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, prefix_sum is a list or array**

Explanation:
- The first line updates `left` to be the maximum of 0 and `i - 2 * k`. Given that `i` is 1 and `k` is not defined, we assume `k` is 0 (as it's the only logical value that keeps `left` at 0). Thus, `left` remains 0.
- The second line updates `right` to be the minimum of `2 * max_diff` and `i + 2 * k` plus 1. Again, assuming `max_diff` is not defined, we can consider it as 0 for simplicity, making `right` equal to `min(0, 1 + 0) + 1`, which simplifies to 1 + 1 = 2. However, since `i` is 1, `right` should be updated to `min(2 * 0, 1 + 2 * 0) + 1`, which results in `right` being 2 + 1 = 3.
- The third line updates `dp_curr[i]` to be `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Since `prefix_sum` is a list or array and its exact values are not given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`. However, based on the initial state, we know that `dp_curr` initially had a key 0 with value 1. After this operation, `dp_curr` will have a key `i` (which is now 3) with the updated value based on the difference in `prefix_sum`.

Given the information provided and the assumption that `k` and `max_diff` are 0, the final state of the variables is as described above.
