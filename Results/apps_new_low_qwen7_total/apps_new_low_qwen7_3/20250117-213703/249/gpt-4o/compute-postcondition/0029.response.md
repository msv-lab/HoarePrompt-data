Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1)` statement. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is 1
   - `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to `(prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - All other variables (`left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `left` remains 0.
   - `right` remains 1.
   - `dp_curr` remains as it was.
   - `prefix_sum` remains as it was.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to `(prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 2 * max_diff + 3**
