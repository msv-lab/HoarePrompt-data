Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop starts from `max_diff + 1` and goes up to `2 * max_diff + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will execute as long as `max_diff + 1 <= i < 2 * max_diff + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `result` is `(result + dp_prev[max_diff + 1]) % MOD`.
   - `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 1\).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be \(\text{max_diff} + 2\).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is still `max_diff + 1 <= i < 2 * max_diff + 1`. Since \(\text{max_diff} + 2\) is within this range, the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - The value of `result` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `dp_prev[max_diff + 1]` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`result` is `(result + dp_prev[max_diff + 1]) % MOD`, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\)**
