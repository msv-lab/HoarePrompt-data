Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `max_diff`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is set to `(result + dp_prev[max_diff + 2]) % MOD`.
   - `i` is currently set to `max_diff + 2`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `max_diff + 1` and goes up to `2 * max_diff + 1`.
   - After the previous iteration where `i` was `max_diff + 2`, the next value of `i` should be `max_diff + 3`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `max_diff`, we need to adjust these values.
   - `i` should be incremented to `max_diff + 3`.
   - `max_diff` remains unchanged as it is a fixed value for the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect that `i` is now `max_diff + 3`.
   - `result` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted, but we can keep it as is.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`result` is `(result + dp_prev[max_diff + 2]) % MOD`, `i` is `max_diff + 3`**.
