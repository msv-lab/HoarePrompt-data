Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from `0` to `2 * max_diff`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * max_diff`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * max_diff`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

5. **Adjust other variables**: The problem states that no other variables are modified within the loop body. Therefore, the values of `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged.

6. **Construct the new state**: The only variable that changes is `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`, `prefix_sum[2]` is \((prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[0]) \% MOD\)**
