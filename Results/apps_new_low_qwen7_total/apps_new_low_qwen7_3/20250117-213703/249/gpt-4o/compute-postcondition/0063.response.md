Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(k\), and \(t\), where \(1 \leq a, b, k \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). It calculates and returns a value based on dynamic programming principles. Specifically, it computes a result derived from a series of operations involving prefix sums and rolling window updates over a range defined by \(2 \cdot k \cdot t\).

Initially, a temporary array `dp_prev` is initialized with zeros. Then, for each iteration of the outer loop up to \(t\), a new array `dp_curr` is similarly initialized. Within each iteration, a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` is computed and used to update `dp_curr` based on the values in `dp_prev` within a specified sliding window of size \(4 \cdot k + 1\). After updating both arrays, they are swapped to prepare for the next iteration.

Finally, the function iterates over the range from `max_diff + 1` to `2 * max_diff` (where `max_diff = 2 \cdot k \cdot t`), accumulating the values from `dp_prev` into the variable `result`. The function then prints the computed result, which is the sum of certain elements in `dp_prev` modulo a constant `MOD`.

Potential edge cases include the initial setup of the arrays and the boundary conditions of the sliding window. The function assumes valid inputs for \(a\), \(b\), \(k\), and \(t\) within their specified ranges. If these conditions are not met, the function may behave unpredictably or raise errors.**

Note: The return statement is missing from the provided code, but the function prints the result. Assuming the intended behavior is to return the printed value, the function would return the computed `result`.
