Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- **a**: An integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- **b**: An integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- **k**: An integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- **max_diff**: \(2 \times k \times t\)
- **dp_prev**: A list of integers with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0
- **dp_curr**: A list of integers with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0
- **prefix_sum**: A list of integers with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\) where all elements are 0
- **i**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) (initial value)
- **left**: \(\max(0, 2 \times \text{max_diff} - 2 \times k)\)
- **right**: \(\min(2 \times \text{max_diff}, 2 \times \text{max_diff}) + 1 = 2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- **result**: 0

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for i in range(max_diff + 1, 2 * max_diff + 1):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of i**:
   - Initially, \(i = 2 \times \text{max_diff}\).
   - The loop will start when \(i\) is within the range \((\text{max_diff} + 1, 2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1)\).

2. **Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the first iteration, \(i\) should be equal to \(\text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - Therefore, \(i\) must be incremented from its initial value to reach \(\text{max_diff} + 1\).

3. **Incrementing i**:
   - Since the loop starts with \(i = 2 \times \text{max_diff}\), the loop must increment \(i\) by 1 until it reaches \(\text{max_diff} + 1\).
   - Hence, \(i\) must be set to \(\text{max_diff} + 1\) at the beginning of the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, \(i\) must be set to \(\text{max_diff} + 1\). 

### Final State:
- \(i\) must be \(\text{max_diff} + 1\)
- All other variables (\(a\), \(b\), \(k\), \(t\), \(\text{max_diff}\), \(\text{dp_prev}\), \(\text{dp_curr}\), \(\text{prefix_sum}\), \(\text{left}\), \(\text{right}\), and \(\text{result}\)) remain as given.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 1\)**.
