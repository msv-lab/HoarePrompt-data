To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the information provided and the conditions under which the loop can run.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as: `for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):`
- The initial values before the loop are:
  - `i` is 4
  - `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`
  - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`
  - `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`
  - `dp_curr` is undefined

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 2 * max_diff`.
   - Therefore, the first iteration occurs when `i == 0`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The given value of `i` is 4, which means it is not equal to 0.

3. **Determine the Correct Initial Value of `i`**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to 0.
   - The value of `i` being 4 does not affect the loop's execution because the loop will start from 0 regardless of the initial value of `i`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `left` and `right` are computed based on the value of `k` and `max_diff`, but their values are not relevant for determining whether the loop starts.
   - `dp_prev` is already defined and initialized, which is necessary for the loop body to use.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, which is also necessary for the loop to use.
   - `dp_curr` being undefined is acceptable since it will be initialized during the loop's first iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the key condition is that `i` must be set to 0. All other variables must maintain their initial values or be properly initialized as shown.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`, `dp_curr` is undefined**.
