Let's analyze the given loop step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `2 * max_diff` inclusive. For each iteration, it updates the `dp_curr` list based on the `prefix_sum` list. The `left` and `right` boundaries are calculated using the current value of `i` and the parameter `k`. The loop updates `dp_curr[i]` with the difference of `prefix_sum` values modulo `MOD`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**:
  - `max_diff` remains constant as it is set initially.
  - `MOD` is a constant, but its value is not provided, so we will keep it as `MOD`.
  - `a`, `b`, `k`, `t` remain unchanged during the loop.
  - `dp_prev` is used as a reference, but its content is modified into `dp_curr` after each iteration.

- **Variables Changing During Loop**:
  - `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.
  - `left` and `right` are recalculated for each `i`.
  - `dp_curr` is updated with new values based on the `prefix_sum` calculations.
  - `prefix_sum` is updated indirectly through `dp_curr` during each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop updates `dp_curr` based on the cumulative sums in `prefix_sum`. As `i` increases, `left` and `right` adjust accordingly to capture the relevant segment of `prefix_sum`. Each update in `dp_curr` reflects the sum of `prefix_sum` within the specified range, adjusted by the boundaries defined by `left` and `right`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the given output states, we observe:
- After the first iteration, `i` becomes `0`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `1`, and `dp_curr[0]` is `1`.
- After the second iteration, `i` becomes `3`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `3`, and `dp_curr[0]` is still `1`.
- After the third iteration, `i` becomes `6`, `left` is `2`, `right` is `5`, and `dp_curr[0]` is still `1`.

This pattern suggests that the loop is updating the `dp_curr` list, and specifically, the value at `dp_curr[0]` remains `1` while other values in `dp_curr` might be updated.

### Final Output State Calculation
After all iterations, `i` will reach `2 * max_diff`. At this point, `dp_curr` will reflect the cumulative effects of all previous updates, and `prefix_sum` will also be fully updated.

Given the nature of the loop and the provided output states, we can infer that:
- `i` will reach `2 * max_diff`.
- `left` and `right` will span the entire range of `prefix_sum`.
- `dp_curr` will contain the cumulative sums of `prefix_sum` within the specified ranges.
- `prefix_sum` will be fully updated.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **i is 2 * max_diff, left is 0, right is 2 * max_diff + 1, dp_curr is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, prefix_sum is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros where each element from prefix_sum[1] to prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 2] is a cumulative sum of dp_prev up to the corresponding index.**
