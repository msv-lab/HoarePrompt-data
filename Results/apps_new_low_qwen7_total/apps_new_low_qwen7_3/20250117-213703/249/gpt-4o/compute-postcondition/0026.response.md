Let's analyze the given loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - For each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]`.

2. **Variables Remaining Constant**:
   - `left` remains 0 throughout the loop.
   - `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) throughout the loop.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they are initialized and are not modified within the loop.

3. **Tracking `prefix_sum`**:
   - Initially, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.

### Iteration Observations
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`):
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

- After the second iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `prefix_sum[2]` is \((prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[1]) \% MOD\).

- After the third iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\).

- This pattern continues up to the last iteration (`i = 2 * max_diff`).

### Final State Calculation
- The loop runs for `2 * max_diff + 1` times.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will have been updated for each index from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

### Final Values
- `i` will be \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) (since the loop runs `2 * max_diff + 1` times and starts from `0`).
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they were initialized.
- `prefix_sum` will have the updated values based on the loop's computation.

### Output State
- **Final `i`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- **Final `left`**: 0
- **Final `right`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- **Final `dp_prev`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `dp_curr`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `prefix_sum`**: A list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), where each element from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) is updated according to the loop's formula.

Output State: `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\); `left` is 0; `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\); `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\).
