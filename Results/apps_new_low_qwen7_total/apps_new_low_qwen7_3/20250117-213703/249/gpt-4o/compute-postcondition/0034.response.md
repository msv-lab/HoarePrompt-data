The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_prev` does not exist, and `dp_curr` is defined as a list with specific values. After the swap, `dp_prev` will take the values of `dp_curr`, and `dp_curr` will be undefined in this context since no new value is assigned to it.

- `i` remains unchanged and is still 4.
- `left` remains unchanged and is still `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`.
- `right` remains unchanged and is still `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`.
- `dp_prev` is now `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- `dp_curr` is undefined after the swap, but before the swap, it had the values `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 4; `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`; `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`; `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`; `dp_curr` is undefined.**
