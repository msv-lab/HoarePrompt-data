The code updates the `prefix_sum` list. Specifically, it sets `prefix_sum[i + 1]` to `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Here, `i` is 0 based on the initial state, so we are updating `prefix_sum[1]`.

- Initially, `prefix_sum` is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros, which means all elements are 0.
- `max_diff` is `2 * k * t`.
- `dp_prev[i]` is 1 when `i` equals `max_diff + (a - b)` and 0 otherwise.

Given these conditions, let's calculate the new value of `prefix_sum[1]`:

1. Since `i` is 0, we are setting `prefix_sum[1]` to `(prefix_sum[0] + dp_prev[0]) % MOD`.
2. `prefix_sum[0]` is initially 0.
3. `dp_prev[0]` is 0 because `0` does not equal `max_diff + (a - b)` (since `a - b` could be any value from -99 to 99 and `max_diff` is at least 2, so their sum cannot be 0).

Thus, `prefix_sum[1] = (0 + 0) % MOD = 0`.

All other elements in `prefix_sum` remain unchanged as the code only modifies `prefix_sum[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is 2 * k * t, `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is 0.**
