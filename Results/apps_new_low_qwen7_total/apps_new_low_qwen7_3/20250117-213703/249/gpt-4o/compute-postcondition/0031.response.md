Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` in the expression `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. This means the loop variable `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. Therefore, the value of `i` needs to be incremented until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `right` is 3.
   - `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the loop variable and must be incremented for each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 3.
   - `left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged because they are not controlled by the loop itself.

5. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**:
   - The loop will execute again when `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 3, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

6. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 4.
   - All other variables (`left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 4, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7**
