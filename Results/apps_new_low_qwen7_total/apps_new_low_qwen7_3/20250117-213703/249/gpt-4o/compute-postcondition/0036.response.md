The code initializes the `prefix_sum` list with zeros, having a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`. Since `max_diff` was previously defined but its value was not specified, we cannot determine the exact length of `prefix_sum`. However, we know the structure of the list.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4
- `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`
- `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`
- `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `dp_curr` is undefined

After running the code:
- `prefix_sum` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 4, `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`, `dp_curr` is undefined.**
