Let's break down the code and determine the final state step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is not explicitly defined, so we need to infer or assume its value. Let's assume it's a positive integer for the sake of this example.
- `max_diff` is not explicitly defined, so we'll assume it's a non-negative integer for the sake of this example.
- `left` is `max(0, -2 * k)`
- `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 2 * k) + 1`
- `dp_curr` is a list, but its content is not provided, so we'll assume it's empty or initialized to some default value. For simplicity, let's assume `dp_curr` is a list with a single element `dp_curr[0] = 0` initially.
- `prefix_sum` is not explicitly defined, but we can assume it's a list or array where `prefix_sum[j]` represents the prefix sum up to index `j`.

### Code Execution:
1. **First Line:**
   ```python
   left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
   ```
   - `i` is 1.
   - We need to know `k` to compute `left`.
   - Assuming `k` is 1 (a simple case), then `i - 2 * k` is `1 - 2 * 1 = -1`.
   - Therefore, `left` becomes `max(0, -1)` which is `0`.

2. **Second Line:**
   ```python
   right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
   ```
   - `i` is 1.
   - We need to know `max_diff` to compute `right`.
   - Assuming `max_diff` is 2 (a simple case), then `2 * max_diff` is `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Therefore, `i + 2 * k` is `1 + 2 * 1 = 3`.
   - So, `right` becomes `min(4, 3) + 1` which is `3 + 1 = 4`.

3. **Third Line:**
   ```python
   dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
   ```
   - `i` is 1.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is 4.
   - We need to know the values of `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[4]` to compute `dp_curr[i]`.
   - Assuming `prefix_sum` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...]` (a simple prefix sum array where `prefix_sum[j] = j`), then `prefix_sum[0]` is `0` and `prefix_sum[4]` is `4`.
   - Therefore, `dp_curr[1]` becomes `(4 - 0) % MOD` which is `4 % MOD`.

### Final Output State:
- `i` remains 1.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 4.
- `dp_curr` now contains `dp_curr[0] = 0` and `dp_curr[1] = 4 % MOD`.

Given that `MOD` is not specified, we assume it is a large number (e.g., 10^9+7). Thus, `dp_curr[1]` is `4`.

### Output State:
Output State: **i is 1, left is 0, right is 4, dp_curr is [0, 4]**

Note: The assumption about `k` and `max_diff` is necessary to proceed with the calculation. If different values were provided, the result would change accordingly.
