The initial state is: `i` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 4, `dp_curr` is [0, 4].

Let's execute the code block:

1. `left = max(0, i - 2 * k)`
   Since `k` is not defined, we assume it is a placeholder and should use the previous value of `left` which is 0. So, `left` remains 0.

2. `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`
   Again, `max_diff` is not defined, so we assume it is a placeholder and use the previous value of `right` which is 4. Thus, `right` remains 4.

3. `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`
   Since `prefix_sum` is not defined, we can't compute the exact value. However, based on the given values, if we assume `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[4]` are the values at indices 0 and 4 respectively, then `dp_curr[2]` would be `(prefix_sum[4] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`.

Given the initial values and the lack of definition for `max_diff` and `k`, and assuming `prefix_sum` has values such that the subtraction and modulo operations are meaningful, we proceed with the updates.

After running the code block, the final state is:
Output State: **i is 2, left is 0, right is 4, dp_curr is [0, 4]** (assuming no changes due to undefined variables).

However, since `dp_curr` is updated at index `i` (which is 2), if we hypothetically assign a value to `prefix_sum`, the updated `dp_curr` would look like `[0, 4, (prefix_sum[4] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD]`.

But without specific values for `prefix_sum`, the most accurate representation of the final state is as provided above.
