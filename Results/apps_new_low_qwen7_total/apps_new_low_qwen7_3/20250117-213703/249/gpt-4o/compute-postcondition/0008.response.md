The code updates the `prefix_sum` list. Specifically, the line `prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD` is executed, where `i` is initially 2. We know from the initial state that `prefix_sum[1]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is 1.

Given this, let's calculate the new value of `prefix_sum[3]`:

- `prefix_sum[2]` is 1
- `dp_prev[2]` is the value at index 2 in the `dp_prev` list, which is 0 (since all elements are 0 except for the one at `max_diff + (a - b)` which is 1, and `a` and `b` are within the range 1 to 100, making `max_diff + (a - b)` also within the range 0 to 200).

So, `prefix_sum[3] = (prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) % MOD = (1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.

All other elements in the `prefix_sum` list remain unchanged, and the other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `t`, `max_diff`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1000\), `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is \(2 \times k \times t\), `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0 except for the element at index \(\text{max\_diff} + (a - b)\) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length \(2 \times \text{max\_diff} + 1\) where all elements are 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is 0, `prefix_sum[2]` is 1, `prefix_sum[3]` is 1, and all other elements in `prefix_sum` are 0.**
