Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` in the range `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. This means `i` is the variable that controls the loop.

2. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is 1
   - `dp_curr` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1
   - `prefix_sum` is a list or array (though its specific contents are not provided, it is assumed to be unchanged from the previous iteration)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

4. **Update the state**: Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `2 * max_diff + 1` must be greater than 1. Assuming `max_diff` is a non-negative integer, `2 * max_diff + 1` will always be greater than 1 unless `max_diff` is 0, but the problem doesn't specify `max_diff` being 0.

Given that `i` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, the other variables (`left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `dp_curr` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, `prefix_sum` is a list or array**
