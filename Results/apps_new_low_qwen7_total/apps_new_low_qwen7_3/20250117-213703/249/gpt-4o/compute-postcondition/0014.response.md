Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `2 * max_diff`, inclusive. The variable `i` starts from `3` (as given in the state at the end of the previous iteration) and increments by `1` in each iteration.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from `3` and the loop runs until `2 * max_diff`, the next value of `i` would be `4` if `max_diff` is greater than `0.5`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[0, 2 * max_diff]`. Given that `i` is currently `3`, `2 * max_diff` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

5. **Adjust the states**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to update its value. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust other variables unless the loop body modifies them.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `left` is 0, `right` is 3, `dp_curr` is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, `prefix_sum` is a list or array**
