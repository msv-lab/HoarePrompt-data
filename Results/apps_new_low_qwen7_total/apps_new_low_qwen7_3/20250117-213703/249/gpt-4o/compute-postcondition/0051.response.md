The code swaps the values of `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`. Initially, `dp_prev` is undefined and `dp_curr` is `[0, 4]`. After the swap, `dp_prev` will be `[0, 4]` and `dp_curr` will also be `[0, 4]` because they now hold the same reference.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `left`, and `right`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is max(0, (2 * `max_diff` - 2 * `k`)), `right` is min(2 * `max_diff`, 2 * `max_diff`) + 1, `dp_prev` is [0, 4], `dp_curr` is [0, 4]**
