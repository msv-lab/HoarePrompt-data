Output State: **i is 4, left is max(0, 3 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, its 4th element equal to 0, and all other elements equal to 0, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 7.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at 3.
   - `left` is initially 1.
   - `right` is initially 3.
   - `dp_curr` is initialized such that `dp_curr[0] = 0` and `dp_curr[1] = (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `2 * max_diff + 1` times, starting from `i = 3` and incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration.
   - For each iteration, the values of `left` and `right` are recalculated based on the current value of `i` and `k`.

3. **First Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - `left = max(0, 3 - 2 * k)` (depends on `k`).
   - `right = min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1` (depends on `k` and `max_diff`).
   - `dp_curr[3] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` (since `prefix_sum` is all zeros, `dp_curr[3] = 0`).

4. **Second Iteration (i = 4)**:
   - `left = max(0, 4 - 2 * k)` (depends on `k`).
   - `right = min(2 * max_diff, 4 + 2 * k) + 1` (depends on `k` and `max_diff`).
   - `dp_curr[4] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` (since `prefix_sum` is all zeros, `dp_curr[4] = 0`).

5. **General Case**:
   - Each iteration updates `i`, `left`, `right`, and `dp_curr[i]` accordingly.
   - `dp_curr` is updated only for the specific index `i` in each iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `2 * max_diff`.
   - `left` and `right` will depend on the specific values of `k` and `max_diff`.
   - `dp_curr` will have its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`, its 4th element equal to 0, and all other elements equal to 0.
   - `prefix_sum` remains a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`.

Therefore, the final output state is as stated above.
