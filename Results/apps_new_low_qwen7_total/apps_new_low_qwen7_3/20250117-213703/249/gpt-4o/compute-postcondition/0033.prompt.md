Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's analyze the given loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = (prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * max_diff`.
   - For each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `dp_prev[i]`.

2. **Variables Remaining Constant**:
   - `left` remains 0 throughout the loop.
   - `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) throughout the loop.
   - `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they are initialized and are not modified within the loop.

3. **Tracking `prefix_sum`**:
   - Initially, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros.
   - In each iteration, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`.

### Iteration Observations
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`):
  - `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`.

- After the second iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `prefix_sum[2]` is \((prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[1]) \% MOD\).

- After the third iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `prefix_sum[3]` is \((prefix_sum[2] + dp_prev[2]) \% MOD\).

- This pattern continues up to the last iteration (`i = 2 * max_diff`).

### Final State Calculation
- The loop runs for `2 * max_diff + 1` times.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will have been updated for each index from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).

### Final Values
- `i` will be \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\) (since the loop runs `2 * max_diff + 1` times and starts from `0`).
- `left` remains 0.
- `right` remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\).
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as they were initialized.
- `prefix_sum` will have the updated values based on the loop's computation.

### Output State
- **Final `i`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\)
- **Final `left`**: 0
- **Final `right`**: \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- **Final `dp_prev`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `dp_curr`**: Reflects cumulative sums (unchanged from initial state)
- **Final `prefix_sum`**: A list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), where each element from `1` to \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) is updated according to the loop's formula.

Output State: `i` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff}\); `left` is 0; `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\); `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums; `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
    right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
    dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: i is 0, left is 0, right is 1, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to (prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 2 * max_diff + 3
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: i is 3, left is 1, right is 3, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 7
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze and execute the code step by step to determine the final output state.

### Initial State
- `i` is 3
- `left` is 1
- `right` is 3
- `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7

### Code Snippet
```python
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Assign `left`**:
   - The value of `left` is calculated as `max(0, i - 2 * k)`.
   - Since `i` is 3, `left` will be `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`.
   - Without the value of `k`, we cannot compute the exact value of `left`. However, we know that `left` will be adjusted based on this formula.

2. **Assign `right`**:
   - The value of `right` is calculated as `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 3, `right` will be `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`.
   - Again, without the value of `k` and `max_diff`, we cannot compute the exact value of `right`. However, we know that `right` will be adjusted based on this formula.

3. **Assign `dp_curr[i]`**:
   - The value of `dp_curr[i]` is set to `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`.
   - Since `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, both `prefix_sum[left]` and `prefix_sum[right]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `dp_curr[i]` will be `(0 - 0) % MOD = 0`.

### Final Output State
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `left` and `right` are updated based on the formulas provided, but their exact values depend on the unknown values of `k` and `max_diff`.
- `dp_curr` at index 4 is set to 0.
- `prefix_sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: i is 4, left is max(0, 3 - 2 * k), right is min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, its 4th element equal to 0, and all other elements equal to 0, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 7**


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
