The code `print(result)` simply prints the value of `result`. Since no assignment or modification to `result` is performed within this line, the value of `result` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only thing that happens is the printing of `result`.

Output State: **`i` is `max_diff + 1`, `result` is \((\sum_{j=max_diff+1}^{2*max_diff} dp_prev[j]) \% MOD\), and `result` is printed.**
