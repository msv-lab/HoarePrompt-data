Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `left` is 0
- `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\)
- `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums
- `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\)
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(2 * max_diff + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration. Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   
2. **Variable `left`**: There is no mention of how `left` changes within the loop body. Since `left` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, it remains `0` unless modified inside the loop. 

3. **Variable `right`**: Similarly, there is no mention of how `right` changes within the loop body. It remains \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\) unless modified inside the loop.

4. **Lists `dp_prev` and `dp_curr`**: These lists remain unchanged as they are used for computations but not modified directly in the loop head.

5. **List `prefix_sum`**: This list remains unchanged as it is used for computations but not modified directly in the loop head.

6. **`prefix_sum[1]`**: This element is set to `dp_prev[0] % MOD` at the beginning of the loop, but it does not change during the loop iterations.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the only variable that changes is `i`. All other variables remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not the case here.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 1\), `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length \(2 \times \text{max_diff} + 3\), `prefix_sum[1]` is `dp_prev[0] % MOD`**
