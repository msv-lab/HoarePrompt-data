Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop head is simply `for _ in range(t)`, which means the loop variable is an underscore `_` and it iterates `t` times.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is an underscore, it does not affect the states directly. Therefore, no specific state changes are required for the loop variable itself.
   - However, the loop might indirectly affect other variables depending on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the initial states given and how they might change based on typical operations within such a loop.

3. Analyze the initial states:
   - `i` is 4
   - `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`
   - `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`
   - `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

4. Consider potential changes due to the loop:
   - Typically, in such loops, variables like `i`, `left`, `right`, and `dp_prev` could be updated or modified within the loop body. However, without the loop body, we cannot determine exact changes.
   - Generally, `i` would likely increment by 1 each iteration unless specified otherwise. But since `i` is not used in the loop condition, it remains unchanged.
   - `left` and `right` depend on `k` and `max_diff`, which are not specified as changing, so they remain the same.
   - `dp_prev` would typically be updated to `dp_curr` at the end of the loop, but since `dp_curr` is undefined, we cannot specify its new value.

5. Conclusion:
   - Given the lack of specific loop body details, the states that could change are `dp_prev` to `dp_curr`, but since `dp_curr` is undefined, we cannot provide a definitive new value for `dp_prev`.
   - Other variables (`i`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`i` is 4, `left` is `max(0, 3 - 2 * k)`, `right` is `min(2 * max_diff, 3 + 2 * k) + 1`, `dp_prev` is `[0, (prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `dp_curr` is undefined**.
