`result` is updated to be `(result + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Since `i` is equal to `\text{max_diff} + 2`, the new value of `result` is `(result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) % MOD`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation for `result`.

Output State: **`result` is `(result + dp_prev[\text{max_diff} + 2]) % MOD`, `i` is \(\text{max_diff} + 2\)**
