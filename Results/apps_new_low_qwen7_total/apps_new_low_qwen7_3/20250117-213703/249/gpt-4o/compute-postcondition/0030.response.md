Output State: **i is 3, left is 1, right is 3, dp_curr is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0, its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`, prefix_sum is a list of zeros with length 7**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to `(prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD`, and `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7.
- The first line updates `left` to be `max(0, i - 2 * k)`. Since `k` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value, but the expression simplifies to `max(0, 1 - 2 * k)`. Given `i` is 1, if `k` is 0 or greater, `left` will be 0; otherwise, it will be 1. For this example, let's assume `k` is such that `left` remains 1 (the most straightforward case where `k` is 0).
- The second line updates `right` to be `min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1`. Assuming `max_diff` is at least 1, and since `i` is 1, `right` becomes `min(2 * 1, 1 + 2 * k) + 1`. If `k` is 0, `right` will be `min(2, 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
- The third line updates `dp_curr[i]` to be `(prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD`. Since `left` is 1 and `right` is 3, and `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, `dp_curr[1]` becomes `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`. Given `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros, both `prefix_sum[3]` and `prefix_sum[1]` are 0, so `dp_curr[1]` is `0 % MOD = 0`.

Given these calculations, the final state is as described above.
