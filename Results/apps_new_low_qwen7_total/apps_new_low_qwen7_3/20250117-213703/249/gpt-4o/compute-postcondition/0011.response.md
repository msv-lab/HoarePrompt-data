Output State: **i is 0, left is 0, right is 1, dp_curr is a dictionary with key 0 and value 1, prefix_sum is a list or array**, **k is unchanged, max_diff is unchanged, MOD is unchanged**

Explanation:
1. The first line `left = max(0, i - 2 * k)` calculates the value of `left` based on the current value of `i` (which is 0) and the value of `k` (unchanged from the initial state). Since `i - 2 * k` is less than or equal to 0, `left` becomes 0.
2. The second line `right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1` calculates the value of `right` based on the current value of `i` (which is 0), the value of `max_diff` (unchanged from the initial state), and the value of `k` (unchanged from the initial state). Since `i + 2 * k` is greater than `2 * max_diff`, `right` becomes `2 * max_diff + 1`.
3. The third line `dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD` updates the value of `dp_curr` at key `i` (which is 0) using the values from the `prefix_sum` list or array. Since `left` is 0 and `right` is `2 * max_diff + 1`, this line calculates `(prefix_sum[2 * max_diff + 1] - prefix_sum[0]) % MOD` and stores it in `dp_curr[0]`. Assuming `prefix_sum` is properly defined, `dp_curr[0]` is set to this calculated value, which we represent as 1 for simplicity.

Note: The actual values of `prefix_sum` and `MOD` are not specified, so they remain unchanged and are represented as "unchanged" in the final state.
