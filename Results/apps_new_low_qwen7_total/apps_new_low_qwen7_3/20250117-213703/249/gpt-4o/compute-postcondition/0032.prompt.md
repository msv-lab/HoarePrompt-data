You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` in the expression `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. This means the loop variable `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(2 * max_diff + 1)`. Therefore, the value of `i` needs to be incremented until it reaches `2 * max_diff`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `right` is 3.
   - `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the loop variable and must be incremented for each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 3.
   - `left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged because they are not controlled by the loop itself.

5. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**:
   - The loop will execute again when `i` is less than `2 * max_diff + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 3, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * max_diff + 1`.

6. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 4.
   - All other variables (`left`, `right`, `dp_curr`, and `prefix_sum`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 4, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `dp_curr` is a list or array with its 0th element equal to 0 and its 1st element equal to `(prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[1]) % MOD`, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length 7**
```
left = max(0, i - 2 * k)
right = min(2 * max_diff, i + 2 * k) + 1
dp_curr[i] = (prefix_sum[right] - prefix_sum[left]) % MOD

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
```
