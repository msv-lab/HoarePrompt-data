To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop runs based on the value of `t`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This means the loop will execute exactly `t` times.

2. **Variables in the Loop Header**: The loop header does not declare any new variables but uses the loop control variable `_`. However, the values of `t` and other variables like `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain unchanged during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Conditions for Execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, the condition `t > 0` is always satisfied at the start.

Given this analysis, the key variable that controls whether the loop will execute is `t`. Since `t` is guaranteed to be within its specified range, the primary condition is already met.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**
- `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- No changes to `a`, `b`, `k`, or `max_diff` are necessary for the first iteration since they do not affect the loop's execution.
- `dp_prev` and `dp_curr` remain as initialized lists of integers.

Therefore, the only requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `t` should be greater than 0, which it inherently is.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is 2 * k * t, `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0**
