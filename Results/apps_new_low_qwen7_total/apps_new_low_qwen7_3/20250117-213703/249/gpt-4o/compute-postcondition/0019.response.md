The code initializes a new list `prefix_sum` with zeros, having a length of `2 * max_diff + 3`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `left`, `right`, `dp_prev`, and `dp_curr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2 * `max_diff`, `left` is 0, `right` is 2 * `max_diff` + 1, `dp_prev` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `dp_curr` is a list or array reflecting cumulative sums, `prefix_sum` is a list of zeros with length `2 * max_diff + 3`**
