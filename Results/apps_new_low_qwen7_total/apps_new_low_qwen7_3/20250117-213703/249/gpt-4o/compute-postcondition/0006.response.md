The code updates the `prefix_sum` list. Specifically, it calculates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` using the formula `(prefix_sum[i] + dp_prev[i]) % MOD`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `prefix_sum[2]` will be updated.

- The value of `prefix_sum[1]` is 0.
- `dp_prev[i]` at `i = 1` is `dp_prev[1]`, which corresponds to the element in `dp_prev` at index `max_diff + (a - b)` (since `i` starts from 1, the index adjustment is necessary).

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `a - b` can range from -99 to 99. Thus, `max_diff + (a - b)` will range from `2 * k * t - 99` to `2 * k * t + 99`.

Given the condition that all elements of `dp_prev` are 0 except for the element at `max_diff + (a - b)`, which is 1, `dp_prev[1]` is 1 if `1 == max_diff + (a - b)` and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, `prefix_sum[2]` will be `prefix_sum[1] + dp_prev[1] % MOD`, which simplifies to `0 + 1 % MOD = 1` because `MOD` is typically 10^9 + 7 and the operation `% MOD` does not change the value here.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `t` must be greater than 0, `max_diff` is 2 * k * t, `dp_prev` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0 except for the element at index max_diff + (a - b) which is 1, `dp_curr` is a list of integers with length 2 * max_diff + 1 where all elements are 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of 2 * max_diff + 3 zeros where `prefix_sum[1]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is 1.**
