### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm and also finds the coefficients of Bézout's identity (i.e., integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)\)).
   - The implementation looks correct for finding the GCD and the Bézout coefficients.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the number of integers \(x\) such that \(L \leq x \leq R\) and \(x = a_1k' + b_1 = a_2l' + b_2\).
   - It correctly uses the results from `func_1` to find the initial solution and then adjusts this solution to fit within the given range.
   - The logic for adjusting the solution and counting the valid values seems correct.
   - However, there is a minor issue with how the function handles the sign of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\). The signs are not consistently checked throughout the function, which might lead to errors in certain edge cases.

3. **Function `adjust_solution`**:
   - This function adjusts the solution \(x\) and \(y\) to ensure that the value \(a_1x + b_1\) lies within the range \([L, R]\).
   - The adjustments seem correct, but there are potential issues with the handling of signs and the loop conditions. For instance, the conditions for updating \(x\) and \(y\) should be more robust to avoid off-by-one errors.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Sign Handling**: The signs of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are not handled consistently. The function assumes that the signs are correctly managed through the initial checks, but this might not always be the case.
- **Loop Conditions**: The loop in `func_2` iterates until \(a_1x + b_1 > R\), but the adjustments inside the loop might cause off-by-one errors if the initial values are not correctly managed.

### Conclusion:
While the overall logic of the program appears correct, there are potential issues with the consistent handling of signs and the robustness of the loop conditions. These issues could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
