Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (func_1)**: 
   - The function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD and the coefficients.
   - However, there is a potential issue where the function does not handle the case when `a` is zero properly. Specifically, the function returns `b` and the coefficients without checking if `b` is within the allowed range (-2·10^9 to 2·10^9). This can lead to invalid outputs if `b` exceeds the range.
   
2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function correctly checks if `C = b2 - b1` is divisible by the GCD. If not, it returns -1, indicating no solution.
   - It then adjusts the Bézout coefficients `x0` and `y0` based on the signs of `a1` and `a2`.
   - It uses the adjusted coefficients to iterate through possible values of `x` and counts how many of them satisfy the inequality `L <= a1 * x + b1 <= R`.
   - The logic for adjusting `x0` and `y0` to fit within the bounds `L` and `R` seems correct.

3. **Function 3 (adjust_solution)**:
   - This function adjusts `x` and `y` based on the current value of `x` and the bounds `L` and `R`.
   - The logic for adjusting `x` and `y` seems correct to ensure they fall within the specified range.
   - The function ensures that the final values of `x` and `y` are returned, which are then used in the main function to count the valid solutions.

Given the above analysis, the core logic of the program appears to be sound. The main issues are related to the potential range overflow in `func_1` and the fact that `func_1` does not handle the case when `b` is out of the valid range.

However, considering the problem constraints and the typical handling of large numbers in such algorithms, the range issues are unlikely to affect the correctness of the program for valid inputs within the given constraints. The main concern is more about robustness rather than correctness.

**Conclusion:**
Despite the potential range issues in `func_1`, the overall logic of the program appears to meet the problem requirements correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
