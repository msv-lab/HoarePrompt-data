### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function computes the GCD of two integers and expresses it as a linear combination using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is a standard and correct approach for finding the coefficients of the linear combination.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function aims to find the number of integers \(x\) such that \(L \leq x \leq R\) and \(x\) belongs to both arithmetic progressions \(a_1k + b_1\) and \(a_2l + b_2\).

1. **Initialization**:
   - Compute the GCD of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
   - Express the GCD as a linear combination of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

2. **Boundary Check**:
   - Check if the constant term \(C = b_2 - b_1\) is divisible by the GCD. If not, there is no solution, and the function returns -1.

3. **Adjust Solution**:
   - Adjust the initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to ensure it fits the signs of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

4. **Count Valid Integers**:
   - Use a while loop to incrementally check values of \(x\) in the range \([L, R]\) until the next value exceeds \(R\).
   - Count how many of these values lie within the range \([L, R]\).

#### Function `adjust_solution`:
This function ensures that the solution \((x_0, y_0)\) is adjusted to fit the boundaries of the range \([L, R]\) by modifying \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) appropriately.

### Example Analysis:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- Input: \(a_1 = 2\), \(b_1 = 0\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(b_2 = 3\), \(L = 5\), \(R = 21\)
- Expected Output: 3 (as seen in the first example provided)

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Compute GCD**:
   - GCD of 2 and 3 is 1.
   - Initial solution for \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) is derived from the equation \(1x_0 + 0y_0 = 1\).

2. **Adjust Solution**:
   - Adjust \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) to fit the signs of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
   - Adjust \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) to fit the range \([L, R]\).

3. **Count Valid Integers**:
   - Start with \(x_0 = 0\) and increment by \(\frac{a_2}{\text{GCD}} = 3\).
   - Values: 6, 12, 18 (all within the range \([5, 21]\)).

The program correctly identifies and counts these values.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and the provided example, it appears that the program is correctly implemented and handles the given test case. The original assessment suggested issues with boundary conditions, but the provided code seems to handle these correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
