### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the number of integers \( x \) within the range \([L, R]\) that can be expressed in both arithmetic progressions \( a_1k + b_1 \) and \( a_2l + b_2 \).

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This is necessary because the problem essentially reduces to finding solutions to the linear Diophantine equation \( a_1k + b_1 = a_2l + b_2 \).

3. **Linear Diophantine Equation**:
   - We convert the problem into solving \( a_1k - a_2l = b_2 - b_1 \).
   - Using `func_1`, we get a particular solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to the equation \( a_1x - a_2y = \text{GCD}(a_1, a_2) \).
   - Since \( b_2 - b_1 \) must be divisible by \(\text{GCD}(a_1, a_2)\), the equation has integer solutions.

4. **Adjust Solution Function**:
   - The `adjust_solution` function ensures the initial solution \((x_0, y_0)\) is adjusted to fit the bounds of the problem.
   - Specifically, it adjusts \( x \) and \( y \) to ensure \( b_1 + a_1 x \) and \( b_2 + a_2 y \) are within the range \([L, R]\).

5. **Main Function**:
   - The `func_2` function iterates over possible values of \( x \) starting from the initial solution and counts how many such \( x \) fall within the range \([L, R]\).
   - The loop correctly increments \( x \) by multiples of \( \frac{a_2}{\text{GCD}} \) and decrements \( y \) by multiples of \( \frac{a_1}{\text{GCD}} \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of GCD Calculation**:
  - The GCD calculation using `func_1` is correct and follows the Euclidean algorithm.

- **Adjustment of Solutions**:
  - The adjustment function `adjust_solution` correctly handles boundary conditions and ensures the solutions stay within the required bounds.

- **Main Loop**:
  - The main loop in `func_2` correctly iterates over the possible values of \( x \) derived from the initial solution and checks if they lie within the given range \([L, R]\).

### Conclusion:

After analyzing each part of the program, it appears that the logic implemented correctly addresses the problem requirements. The GCD calculation, adjustment of solutions, and counting within the specified range all seem to be handled appropriately.

### Correctness:

The given program is correct according to the problem description.

**Final: True**
