Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = func_1(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return (gcd, x, y)

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is zero, it directly returns `b` and the coefficients `0` and `1` that satisfy the equation `gcd = b * 0 + a * 1`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm and finds the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `gcd = a * x + b * y`. The function returns the GCD and the coefficients `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `a` is zero, the function correctly returns `b` and the coefficients `0` and `1`.
- The function handles integer values within the specified ranges (-2·10^9 to 2·10^9).

Missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function returns `b` as an integer within the range of -2·10^9 to 2·10^9, 0, and 1, but the actual code does not limit `b` to this range. Therefore, the returned value of `b` could potentially exceed these limits if `a` is zero.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are zero, although this is technically a valid input for computing the GCD. In practice, the function should ideally return an appropriate error message or handle this case differently since the GCD of zero with any number is undefined in a mathematical sense.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts six integer parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. It first computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of `a1` and `a2` along with their Bézout coefficients using `func_1`. If `b2 - b1` is not divisible by the GCD, it returns -1. Otherwise, it adjusts the Bézout coefficients `x0` and `y0` based on the signs of `a1` and `a2`. Then, it calculates the integer divisions of `a1` and `a2` by their GCD and uses these values to generate solutions `(x0, y0)` to the equation `a1 * x + b1 * y = c`, where `c` is `b2 - b1`. It iterates over possible integer values of `x` and counts how many of them satisfy the inequality `L <= a1 * x + b1 <= R`. If no such `x` exists, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count of valid `x` values.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2):

        x += k * a2_div_gcd
        y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    else:
        k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)
        x += k * a2_div_gcd
        y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    if b1 + a1 * x < L:
        x += a2_div_gcd
        y -= a1_div_gcd

 Output hints for function3:  The function `adjust_solution` accepts six parameters: `x` and `y` (both integers), `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` (both positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of `a1` and `a2` divided by their respective gcd), `sign_a1` (an integer representing the sign of `a1` and either 1 or -1), and `L` and `R` (both integers such that `L` <= `R`). 

The function first checks the value of `sign_a1` and adjusts `x` and `y` accordingly using `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd`. Then, it checks whether `b1 + a1 * x` is less than `L` or greater than `R`. If `b1 + a1 * x` is less than `L`, `x` is increased by `a2_div_gcd` and `y` is decreased by `a1_div_gcd`. If `b1 + a1 * x` is greater than `R`, `x` is decreased by `a2_div_gcd` and `y` is increased by `a1_div_gcd`.

After these adjustments, the function returns `x` and `y`. If none of the conditions are met, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. This means that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` are integers, possibly updated based on the conditions, while `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
