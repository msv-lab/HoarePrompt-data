Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that each function behaves as expected and collectively meets the problem requirements. Let's analyze each part step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the GCD and Bézout coefficients. The function logic seems correct for computing the GCD and coefficients. However, there are a couple of minor issues:
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are zero, although this is not a typical input scenario for computing the GCD.
   - The returned value of `b` is not limited to the range of -2·10^9 to 2·10^9, but this is not critical for the problem since the GCD will be much smaller.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the number of integers `x` that satisfy the given conditions. Here are the key points:
   - It correctly computes the GCD and Bézout coefficients using `func_1`.
   - It checks if `C = b2 - b1` is divisible by the GCD. If not, it returns -1, which is correct because there would be no common solution.
   - It adjusts the Bézout coefficients `x0` and `y0` based on the signs of `a1` and `a2`.
   - It calculates the integer divisions of `a1` and `a2` by their GCD.
   - It iterates over possible integer values of `x` and counts how many of them satisfy the inequality `L <= a1 * x + b1 <= R`.

3. **Function `adjust_solution`**: This function adjusts the solution `(x, y)` based on the bounds `L` and `R`. It ensures that `b1 + a1 * x` falls within the required range. The logic here is sound and necessary to ensure the solution is within the bounds.

Given that:
- `func_1` computes the GCD and coefficients correctly.
- `func_2` correctly uses these coefficients to find the valid `x` values within the specified range.
- `adjust_solution` ensures that the solution respects the bounds `L` and `R`.

All functions work together to solve the problem accurately, and the overall program meets the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
