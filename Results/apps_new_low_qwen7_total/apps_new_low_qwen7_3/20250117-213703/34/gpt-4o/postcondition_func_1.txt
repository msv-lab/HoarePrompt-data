The function `func_2` accepts six integer parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. It first computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of `a1` and `a2` along with their Bézout coefficients using `func_1`. If `b2 - b1` is not divisible by the GCD, it returns -1. Otherwise, it adjusts the Bézout coefficients `x0` and `y0` based on the signs of `a1` and `a2`. Then, it calculates the integer divisions of `a1` and `a2` by their GCD and uses these values to generate solutions `(x0, y0)` to the equation `a1 * x + b1 * y = c`, where `c` is `b2 - b1`. It iterates over possible integer values of `x` and counts how many of them satisfy the inequality `L <= a1 * x + b1 <= R`. If no such `x` exists, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count of valid `x` values.
