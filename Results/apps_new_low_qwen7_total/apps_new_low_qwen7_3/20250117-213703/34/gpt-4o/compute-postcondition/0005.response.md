Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers, `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` are positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of `a1` and `a2` divided by their respective gcd, `sign_a1` is either 1 or -1 representing the sign of `a1`, `L` and `R` are integers such that `L` <= `R`. If `sign_a1` > 0, then `x` is updated by adding `k` * `a2_div_gcd` where `k` = (`L` - (`b1` + `a1` * `x`)) // (`a1` * `a1_div_gcd`), `y` is updated by subtracting `k` * `a1_div_gcd`, and `sign_a1` remains 1. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are updated, and all other variables (`a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, `R`) remain unchanged. The current value of `b1 + a1 * x` is less than `L`.**
