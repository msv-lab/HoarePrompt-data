Output State: **total is unchanged, students is unchanged, a1 is unchanged, b1 is unchanged, a2 is unchanged, b2 is unchanged, L is unchanged, R is unchanged, A is abs(a1), B is abs(a2), C is b2 - b1, gcd is unchanged, x0 is x0 + a2_div_gcd, y0 is y0 - a1_div_gcd, count is incremented by 1 if L <= val <= R, and remains unchanged if val is greater than R**

Explanation:
- The first line `x0 += a2_div_gcd` increments `x0` by the value of `a2_div_gcd`.
- The second line `y0 -= a1_div_gcd` subtracts the value of `a1_div_gcd` from `y0`.
- Both `x0` and `y0` are updated based on their respective divisions by `gcd`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition `L <= val <= R` is met; otherwise, it remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.
