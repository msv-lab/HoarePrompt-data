Output State: **x is updated, y is updated, a1_div_gcd is unchanged, a2_div_gcd is unchanged, sign_a1 is unchanged, L is unchanged, R is unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `k` using the formula `(R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)`. However, since `b1` is not defined in the initial state or provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. The value of `k` depends on the initial values of `R`, `b1`, `a1`, and `x`.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `k * a2_div_gcd` to its current value. Since `k` is calculated based on the initial values, this line modifies `x`.
- The third line updates `y` by subtracting `k * a1_div_gcd` from its current value. Again, since `k` is calculated based on the initial values, this line modifies `y`.

All other variables (`a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the executed code.
