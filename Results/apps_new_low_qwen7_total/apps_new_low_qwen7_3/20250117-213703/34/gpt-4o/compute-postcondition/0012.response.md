The function `adjust_solution` accepts six parameters: `x` and `y` (both integers), `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` (both positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of `a1` and `a2` divided by their respective gcd), `sign_a1` (an integer representing the sign of `a1` and either 1 or -1), and `L` and `R` (both integers such that `L` <= `R`).

If the condition `b1 + a1 * x > R` is true, then `x` and `y` may change based on some internal logic not specified here. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `adjust_solution` is to accept parameters `x`, `y`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R`, and return `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` may have changed if the condition `b1 + a1 * x > R` is met, otherwise they remain the same as the input parameters.
