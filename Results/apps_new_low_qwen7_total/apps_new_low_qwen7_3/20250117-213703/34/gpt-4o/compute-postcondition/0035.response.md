Output State: a1 is unchanged, b1 is unchanged, a2 is unchanged, b2 is unchanged, L is unchanged, R is unchanged, A is abs(a1), B is abs(a2), C is b2 - b1, gcd is unchanged, x0 is x0 + n * a2_div_gcd where n is the number of iterations, y0 is y0 - n * a1_div_gcd where n is the number of iterations, count is incremented by 1 for each iteration where L <= a1 * (x0 + n * a2_div_gcd) + b1 <= R, and the loop breaks if a1 * (x0 + n * a2_div_gcd) + b1 > R.
