Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `students` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, `b1` is unchanged, `a2` is unchanged, `b2` is unchanged, `L` is unchanged, `R` is unchanged, `A` is `abs(a1)`, `B` is `abs(a2)`, `C` is `b2 - b1`, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is `x0 + a2_div_gcd` if `a2_div_gcd` is defined, otherwise `x0` remains `x0 + a2_div_gcd`, `y0` is `y0 - a1_div_gcd` if `a1_div_gcd` is defined, otherwise `y0` remains `y0 - a1_div_gcd`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `L` <= `val` <= `R`, and remains unchanged if `val` is greater than `R`.***
