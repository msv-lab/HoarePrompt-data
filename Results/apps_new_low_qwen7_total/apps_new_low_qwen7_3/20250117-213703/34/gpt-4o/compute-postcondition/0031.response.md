Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `students` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, `b1` is unchanged, `a2` is unchanged, `b2` is unchanged, `L` is unchanged, `R` is unchanged, `A` is `abs(a1)`, `B` is `abs(a2)`, `C` is `b2 - b1`, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is `x0 + a2_div_gcd`, `y0` is `y0 - a1_div_gcd`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1` is within the range `[L, R]`, and remains unchanged if `a1 * (x0 + a2_div_gcd) + b1` is greater than `R`. If `val > R`, the loop or if-else block is exited without further changes to the variables.***
