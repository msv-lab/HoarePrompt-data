Postcondition: **`total` is unchanged, `students` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, `b1` is unchanged, `a2` is unchanged, `b2` is unchanged, `L` is unchanged, `R` is unchanged, `A` is `abs(a1)`, `B` is `abs(a2)`, `C` is `b2 - b1`, `gcd` is unchanged, `x0` is `x0 * (C // gcd)` if `B < 0`, otherwise `x0` remains `x0 * (C // gcd)`, `y0` is `-y0` if `B < 0`, otherwise `y0` remains unchanged, `count` is 0, `val` is `a1 * x0 + b1`, and `val` is greater than `R`.**
