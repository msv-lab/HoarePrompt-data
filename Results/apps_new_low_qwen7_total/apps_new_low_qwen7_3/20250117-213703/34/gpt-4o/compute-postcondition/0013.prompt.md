You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, a1_div_gcd and a2_div_gcd are positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of a1 and a2 divided by their respective gcd, sign_a1 is either 1 or -1 representing the sign of a1, and L and R are integers such that L <= R.
def adjust_solution(x, y, a1_div_gcd, a2_div_gcd, sign_a1, sign_a2):
    if (sign_a1 > 0) :
        k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)

x += k * a2_div_gcd

y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    else :
        k = (R - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)

x += k * a2_div_gcd

y -= k * a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` and `y` are integers. `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` are positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of `a1` and `a2` divided by their respective gcd. `sign_a1` is either 1 or -1 representing the sign of `a1`. `L` and `R` are integers such that `L` <= `R`. If `sign_a1` > 0, then `x` is updated by adding `k` * `a2_div_gcd` where `k` = (`L` - (`b1` + `a1` * `x`)) // (`a1` * `a1_div_gcd`), `y` is updated by subtracting `k` * `a1_div_gcd`, and `sign_a1` remains 1. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are updated, and all other variables (`a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, `R`) remain unchanged.
    if (b1 + a1 * x < L) :
        x += a2_div_gcd

y -= a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` and `y` are integers. If `b1 + a1 * x < L`, then `x` is increased by `a2_div_gcd`, `y` is decreased by `a1_div_gcd`, and `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
    if (b1 + a1 * x > R) :
        x -= a2_div_gcd

y += a1_div_gcd
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` and `y` are integers. If `b1 + a1 * x > R`, then `x` is decreased by `a2_div_gcd`, `y` is increased by `a1_div_gcd`, and `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
    return x, y
    #The program returns x and y, where x and y may have changed based on the condition b1 + a1 * x > R, otherwise they remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `adjust_solution` accepts six parameters: `x` and `y` (both integers), `a1_div_gcd` and `a2_div_gcd` (both positive integers representing the greatest common divisor of `a1` and `a2` divided by their respective gcd), `sign_a1` (an integer representing the sign of `a1` and either 1 or -1), and `L` and `R` (both integers such that `L` <= `R`).
#
#If the condition `b1 + a1 * x > R` is true, then `x` and `y` may change based on some internal logic not specified here. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `adjust_solution` is to accept parameters `x`, `y`, `a1_div_gcd`, `a2_div_gcd`, `sign_a1`, `L`, and `R`, and return `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` may have changed if the condition `b1 + a1 * x > R` is met, otherwise they remain the same as the input parameters.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns x and y, where x and y may have changed based on the condition b1 + a1 * x > R, otherwise they remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
