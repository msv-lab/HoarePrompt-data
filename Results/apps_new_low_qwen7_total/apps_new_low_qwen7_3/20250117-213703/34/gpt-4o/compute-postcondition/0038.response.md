Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts six integer parameters: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `L`, and `R`. It first computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of `a1` and `a2` along with their Bézout coefficients using `func_1`. If `b2 - b1` is not divisible by the GCD, it returns -1. Otherwise, it adjusts the Bézout coefficients `x0` and `y0` based on the signs of `a1` and `a2`. Then, it calculates the integer divisions of `a1` and `a2` by their GCD and uses these values to generate solutions `(x0, y0)` to the equation `a1 * x + b1 * y = c`, where `c` is `b2 - b1`. It iterates over possible integer values of `x` and counts how many of them satisfy the inequality `L <= a1 * x + b1 <= R`. If no such `x` exists, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count of valid `x` values.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `a1` and `a2` are non-zero. If either `a1` or `a2` is zero, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.
- The function does not handle cases where `L` > `R`. In such cases, the loop should not run, and the function should return -1 immediately.
- The function does not validate that `b2 - b1` is within the bounds of integer representation, although the annotation suggests it is. This could lead to overflow issues depending on the values of `b1` and `b2`.
- The function does not explicitly check if the initial `x0` and `y0` satisfy the equation `a1 * x0 + b1 * y0 = b2 - b1` before adjusting them. While the adjustment process should ensure this condition holds, an explicit check could provide additional robustness.
