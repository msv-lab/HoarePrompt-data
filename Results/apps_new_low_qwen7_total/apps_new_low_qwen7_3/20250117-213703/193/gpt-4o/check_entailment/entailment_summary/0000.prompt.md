Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

# Program:
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)





# Execution Summary:
The function reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the standard input, where \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). It then calculates and returns the integer value of \(\frac{x - y}{2} + \frac{(x - y) \mod 2}{2}\), which is effectively the integer division of the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) by 2. This results in the middle integer of the sequence from \( y \) to \( x \) inclusive, if \( x - y \) is even, or the lower middle integer if \( x - y \) is odd. The function does not directly compute the sum of all integers from \( y \) to \( x \); instead, it returns a single integer value based on the specified calculation.
