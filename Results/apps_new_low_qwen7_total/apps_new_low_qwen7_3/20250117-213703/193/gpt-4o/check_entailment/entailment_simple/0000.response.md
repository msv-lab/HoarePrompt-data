### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and steps involved:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y` using the minimum number of operations. Each operation consists of reducing the length of one side of the triangle, ensuring it remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., all sides remain positive).

2. **Key Insight**: For an equilateral triangle, reducing one side affects the others due to the triangle inequality theorem (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). However, since we start and end with equilateral triangles, we can simplify our approach by focusing on reducing all three sides uniformly until they match `y`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   ```python
   def func():
       x, y = map(int, input().split())
       print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
   ```
   - The code takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, where `x` is the initial side length and `y` is the target side length.
   - It then computes `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` and prints the result.

4. **Calculation Explanation**:
   - `(x - y)` represents the total reduction needed.
   - `(x - y) // 2` calculates the integer division, which is the number of full steps of decrementing by 2.
   - `(x - y) % 2` calculates the remainder, which handles the last decrement if necessary.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first example: `x = 6`, `y = 3`.
     - Total reduction needed: \(6 - 3 = 3\).
     - Integer division: \(3 // 2 = 1\) (one step of decrementing by 2).
     - Remainder: \(3 \% 2 = 1\) (one more step of decrementing by 1).
     - Total operations: \(1 + 1 = 2\) (but the output is 4, which is incorrect).

   - For the second example: `x = 8`, `y = 5`.
     - Total reduction needed: \(8 - 5 = 3\).
     - Integer division: \(3 // 2 = 1\) (one step of decrementing by 2).
     - Remainder: \(3 \% 2 = 1\) (one more step of decrementing by 1).
     - Total operations: \(1 + 1 = 2\) (but the output is 3, which is incorrect).

   - For the third example: `x = 22`, `y = 4`.
     - Total reduction needed: \(22 - 4 = 18\).
     - Integer division: \(18 // 2 = 9\) (nine steps of decrementing by 2).
     - Remainder: \(18 \% 2 = 0\) (no additional step needed).
     - Total operations: \(9 + 0 = 9\) (but the output is 6, which is incorrect).

Given the examples, the code does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
