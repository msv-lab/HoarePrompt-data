### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Understanding:
We need to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \(x\) into one of side length \(y\), where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). At each step, we can reduce the length of a single side of the current triangle to ensure it remains a non-degenerate triangle. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required for this transformation.

#### Correct Approach:
Each side of the triangle must be reduced independently from \(x\) to \(y\). Since the triangle must remain equilateral throughout the process, the minimum number of steps required to reduce one side from \(x\) to \(y\) is \(x - y\). Because the reduction of each side is independent and must happen simultaneously to keep the triangle equilateral, the total number of steps required is \(x - y\).

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2\).

- \((x - y) // 2\) calculates the integer division of \(x - y\) by 2.
- \((x - y) % 2\) calculates the remainder when \(x - y\) is divided by 2.

Let's analyze why this formula is incorrect:
- When \(x - y\) is even, \((x - y) // 2\) gives the exact number of steps needed, and \((x - y) % 2\) is 0, so the result is just \((x - y) // 2\).
- When \(x - y\) is odd, \((x - y) // 2\) gives the floor division, and \((x - y) % 2\) is 1, so the result is \((x - y) // 2 + 1\).

However, the critical issue is that the provided solution does not correctly handle the sequence of reductions. For example:
- If \(x = 6\) and \(y = 3\), the correct answer should be 4 (since we need to reduce one side from 6 to 3 in 4 steps), but the provided solution gives 2.
- If \(x = 8\) and \(y = 5\), the correct answer should be 3, but the provided solution also gives 2.

The provided solution does not correctly account for the cumulative effect of reducing each side independently.

#### Correct Solution:
The correct approach is to simply return \(x - y\), because each side must be reduced by exactly \(x - y\) steps.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not accurately model the minimum number of steps required to transform the triangle. The correct solution should be:

```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print(x - y)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the provided solution. The correct answer is **False**.
