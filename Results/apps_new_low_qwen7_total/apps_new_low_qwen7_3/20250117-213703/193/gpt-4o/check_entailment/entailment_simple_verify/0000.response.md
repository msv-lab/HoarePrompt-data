### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code against the problem statement and the examples provided.

#### Program Analysis
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This program reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the input, where \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \), and then calculates and prints the value of \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2\).

#### Annotated Code Explanation
The annotated code provides insight into the initial state of the program before the function call:
- \( x \) and \( y \) are integers with \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \).

#### Example Evaluations
We will evaluate the provided examples using the program to see if the output matches the expected results.

1. **Example 1**: Input `6 3`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: \((6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`)
   - The program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

2. **Example 2**: Input `8 5`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: \((8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`)
   - The program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

3. **Example 3**: Input `22 4`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: \((22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) \% 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 \% 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`)
   - The program outputs `9`, which is incorrect.

From these evaluations, it is clear that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of steps required to transform the triangle. The formula \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) does not account for the necessary triangle inequality constraints and does not provide the correct minimum number of steps for all possible values of \( x \) and \( y \).

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not adhere to the necessary steps required to maintain a valid triangle throughout the transformation process.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
