You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

- Program: 
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())

print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \). The formula used in the program, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, is incorrect for determining the minimum number of steps.

For example, consider the input `10 5`. According to the problem description, we need to reduce the side length from 10 to 5 by changing one side at a time while maintaining the triangle inequality. A valid sequence of changes could be:

- Start with (10, 10, 10)
- Change one side to 9: (9, 10, 10)
- Change another side to 9: (9, 9, 10)
- Change the last side to 9: (9, 9, 9)
- Change one side to 8: (8, 9, 9)
- Change another side to 8: (8, 8, 9)
- Change the last side to 8: (8, 8, 8)
- Change one side to 7: (7, 8, 8)
- Change another side to 7: (7, 7, 8)
- Change the last side to 7: (7, 7, 7)
- Change one side to 6: (6, 7, 7)
- Change another side to 6: (6, 6, 7)
- Change the last side to 6: (6, 6, 6)
- Change one side to 5: (5, 6, 6)
- Change another side to 5: (5, 5, 6)
- Change the last side to 5: (5, 5, 5)

This shows that it takes 12 steps to transform a triangle of side length 10 into one of side length 5. However, the program would output:

```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)

func()
```

For the input `10 5`, the output would be `3` instead of `12`.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
