You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.

- Program:
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the standard input, where \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). It then calculates and returns the integer value of \(\frac{x - y}{2} + \frac{(x - y) \mod 2}{2}\), which is effectively the integer division of the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) by 2. This results in the middle integer of the sequence from \( y \) to \( x \) inclusive, if \( x - y \) is even, or the lower middle integer if \( x - y \) is odd. The function does not directly compute the sum of all integers from \( y \) to \( x \); instead, it returns a single integer value based on the specified calculation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \). The formula used in the program, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, is incorrect for determining the minimum number of steps.

For example, consider the input `10 5`. According to the problem description, we need to reduce the side length from 10 to 5 by changing one side at a time while maintaining the triangle inequality. A valid sequence of changes could be:

- Start with (10, 10, 10)
- Change one side to 9: (9, 10, 10)
- Change another side to 9: (9, 9, 10)
- Change the last side to 9: (9, 9, 9)
- Change one side to 8: (8, 9, 9)
- Change another side to 8: (8, 8, 9)
- Change the last side to 8: (8, 8, 8)
- Change one side to 7: (7, 8, 8)
- Change another side to 7: (7, 7, 8)
- Change the last side to 7: (7, 7, 7)
- Change one side to 6: (6, 7, 7)
- Change another side to 6: (6, 6, 7)
- Change the last side to 6: (6, 6, 6)
- Change one side to 5: (5, 6, 6)
- Change another side to 5: (5, 5, 6)
- Change the last side to 5: (5, 5, 5)

This shows that it takes 12 steps to transform a triangle of side length 10 into one of side length 5. However, the program would output:

```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)

func()
```

For the input `10 5`, the output would be `3` instead of `12`.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
