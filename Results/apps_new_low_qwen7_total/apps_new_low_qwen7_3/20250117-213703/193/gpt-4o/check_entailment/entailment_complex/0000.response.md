Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` using the minimum number of operations.
   - Each operation allows us to change the length of one side of the triangle to a new integer length while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides must be positive and the triangle inequality must hold).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2\).
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - \((x - y) // 2\) computes the integer division of the difference between `x` and `y` by 2.
     - \((x - y) % 2\) computes the remainder when the difference is divided by 2.
     - Adding these together effectively calculates the middle integer of the range from `y` to `x`.

3. **Triangle Inequality Consideration**:
   - For the transformation to be valid, the new side length after each operation must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
   - However, the formula \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2\) does not inherently guarantee that the intermediate steps maintain the triangle inequality throughout the process.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: 
     - Input: \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \)
     - Output: 4 (which is correct based on the example in the problem statement)
   - **Example 2**:
     - Input: \( x = 8 \), \( y = 5 \)
     - Output: 3 (which is also correct based on the example in the problem statement)

Given these points, the provided solution seems to handle some edge cases correctly but may not cover all possible scenarios where the intermediate steps strictly adhere to the triangle inequality. Therefore, we need to verify if the logic can handle all valid transformations correctly.

Since the provided solution does not directly validate each step of the transformation to ensure the triangle inequality holds at every stage, it might fail in more complex cases.

Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
