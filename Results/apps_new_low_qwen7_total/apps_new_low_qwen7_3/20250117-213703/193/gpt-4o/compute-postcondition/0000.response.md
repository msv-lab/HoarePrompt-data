Initial State: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

Code Block:
```
x, y = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

Analysis:
1. The `input()` function reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into two space-separated values, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`.
2. The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the integer division by 2 of `(x - y)` and adds the remainder of `(x - y)` divided by 2. This effectively rounds down `(x - y) / 2` if `(x - y)` is even, or rounds up if `(x - y)` is odd.

Given the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, let's denote the difference `d = x - y`. Since `x > y`, `d` is always a positive integer. The expression `(d // 2) + (d % 2)` will always result in `d // 2` when `d` is even, and `d // 2 + 1` when `d` is odd.

Final State:
- `x` and `y` are updated to the integer values read from the input.
- A value is printed based on the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.

Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer, the printed value is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
