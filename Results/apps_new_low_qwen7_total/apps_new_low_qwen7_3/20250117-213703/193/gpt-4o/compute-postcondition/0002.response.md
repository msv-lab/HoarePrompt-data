Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the standard input, where \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \). It then calculates and returns the integer value of \(\frac{x - y}{2} + \frac{(x - y) \mod 2}{2}\), which is effectively the integer division of the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) by 2. This results in the middle integer of the sequence from \( y \) to \( x \) inclusive, if \( x - y \) is even, or the lower middle integer if \( x - y \) is odd. The function does not directly compute the sum of all integers from \( y \) to \( x \); instead, it returns a single integer value based on the specified calculation.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( x - y = 0 \), the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because the expression \(\frac{x - y}{2}\) involves division by zero. However, given the constraints \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \), this case should not occur.
- If \( x - y \) is odd, the function will still correctly compute the lower middle integer of the range. For example, if \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 3 \), the result will be 4, which is the lower middle integer of the range [3, 5].

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return the sum of all integers from \( y \) to \( x \). It only returns a specific integer value based on the given formula.
