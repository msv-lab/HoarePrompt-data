### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2`, which ensures the vectors are ordered by their angles relative to the positive x-axis. This is necessary to handle the circular nature of angles.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors in the sorted list (with a maximum of 100 pairs due to the loop condition `for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`). This approach is efficient because it leverages the sorted order to minimize the number of calculations needed.
4. **Finding Minimum Angle**: The smallest angle is tracked using the variable `ans_angle`. Whenever a smaller angle is found, the corresponding indices are updated.
5. **Output**: Finally, the indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing.

### Key Points:
- **Sorting by Angle**: Sorting by `math.atan2` is correct as it ensures the angles are in the right order.
- **Efficient Pair Calculation**: Limiting the number of pairs to be checked to `min(n, i + 100)` is a reasonable optimization, especially given the large constraints on `n`.
- **Correct Angle Calculation**: The angle calculation using `math.acos` is correct but could be simplified using the dot product formula directly, which avoids potential precision issues with `acos`.

Given the logic and implementation details, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
