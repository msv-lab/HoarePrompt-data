Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates, where each vector starts at the origin. The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each vector is represented by a tuple (x_i, y_i) where |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they may have opposite directions.
def func():
    n = int(input())

v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        v.append((x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: n is greater than 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, v is a list containing n tuples (x, y). The loop executes exactly n times, appending a new tuple (x, y) to the list v in each iteration.
    ans = 0, 1

ans_angle = math.pi

v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v
                [i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is greater than 0, i is n-1, j is the index such that (i, j) gives the minimum angle, ans_angle is the minimum angle found, and ans is the tuple (i, j) with the smallest angle.
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates and finds a pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. It first reads the number of vectors `n` and then reads each vector's coordinates. After sorting the vectors based on their polar angles, it iterates through the list to find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle. If multiple pairs have the same smallest angle, it returns the first pair found. The function prints the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. The function does not return a value directly but prints the result. Edge cases include handling a list with only two vectors and ensuring that the angle calculations are accurate even when vectors are very close to being collinear.
