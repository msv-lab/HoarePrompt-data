### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes by reading the number of vectors `n`.
   - It then constructs a list of vectors `v`, each represented as a tuple `(x, y)`.

2. **Sorting Vectors:**
   - The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2` to get their polar angles. This ensures that the vectors are ordered by their direction relative to the positive x-axis.

3. **Finding the Minimal Angle Pair:**
   - The program uses a nested loop to compare angles between pairs of vectors.
   - The cosine similarity formula is used to calculate the angle between two vectors \( \mathbf{v_i} \) and \( \mathbf{v_j} \):
     \[
     \text{angle} = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{v_i} \cdot \mathbf{v_j}}{\|\mathbf{v_i}\| \|\mathbf{v_j}\|}\right)
     \]
   - This approach is mathematically correct and will find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the vectors are very close to being collinear (i.e., when the dot product calculation might be imprecise due to floating-point arithmetic).
   - The use of `min(n, i + 100)` in the inner loop ensures that the search space is manageable and avoids unnecessary computations.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices of the vectors with the smallest angle, adjusted to 1-based indexing.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is sound and correctly implements the algorithm to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. There are no apparent errors or inefficiencies in the code based on the provided annotations and reasoning.

### Correctness:
