### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2`, which ensures the vectors are ordered by their angles relative to the positive x-axis. This is necessary to handle the circular nature of angles.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors in the sorted list (with a maximum of 100 pairs due to the loop condition `for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`). This approach is efficient because it leverages the sorted order to minimize the number of calculations needed.
4. **Finding Minimum Angle**: The smallest angle is tracked using the variable `ans_angle`. Whenever a smaller angle is found, the corresponding indices are updated.
5. **Output**: Finally, the indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing.

However, there are some potential issues and areas for improvement:

- **Angle Calculation**: The angle calculation using `math.acos` is correct but could be simplified using the dot product formula directly, which avoids potential precision issues with `acos`. The formula for the dot product is:
  \[
  \text{cos}(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}}
  \]
  Since we need the non-oriented angle, we should consider both clockwise and counterclockwise angles. The minimal non-oriented angle between two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \theta = \min(\arccos(\text{cos}(\theta)), 2\pi - \arccos(\text{cos}(\theta)))
  \]

- **Pair Calculation**: The current implementation limits the number of pairs to be checked to `min(n, i + 100)`, which might not be necessary. Checking all pairs would ensure correctness but is less efficient. However, the current implementation is optimized for large `n`.

- **Edge Cases**: The program assumes that the input guarantees no two vectors have the same direction, but it does not explicitly handle cases where vectors have very close angles, which might lead to floating-point precision issues.

Despite these potential issues, the core logic of sorting the vectors and calculating the minimal angle between consecutive vectors is sound. The program should work correctly for most practical cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the overall logic and the fact that the program handles the main aspects of the problem effectively, the program is correct. The potential improvements mentioned do not significantly affect the correctness of the program under normal conditions.

Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and there are no critical issues that would make the program incorrect.
