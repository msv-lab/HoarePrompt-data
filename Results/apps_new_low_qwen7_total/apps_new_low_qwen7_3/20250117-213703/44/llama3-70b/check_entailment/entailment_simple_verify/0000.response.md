### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly finds the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

1. **Input Parsing and Vector Representation**:
   - The program reads the number of vectors `n`.
   - It then reads `n` pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` representing the vectors and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Sorting Vectors**:
   - The vectors are sorted based on their polar angle using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This ensures that the vectors are ordered in a way that minimizes the angular difference when compared sequentially.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle**:
   - The program iterates through each vector and checks the angle with the next 100 vectors (or fewer if `i + 100` exceeds `n`). This ensures that we check a sufficient number of vectors to potentially find the minimal angle.
   - The angle between two vectors \( \vec{v}_i \) and \( \vec{v}_j \) is calculated using the dot product formula:
     \[
     \text{angle} = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_j}{|\vec{v}_i| |\vec{v}_j|}\right)
     \]
   - If the calculated angle is smaller than the current minimal angle `ans_angle`, the program updates `ans_angle` and sets `ans` to the indices `(i, j)`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the indices of the vectors with the minimal angle, adjusted by 1 to match the 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Evaluate:

1. **Sorting Based on Polar Angle**:
   - Sorting the vectors based on their polar angle ensures that consecutive vectors in the sorted list are close in angle, which is crucial for finding the minimal angle efficiently.

2. **Window Size of 100**:
   - Checking the angle with the next 100 vectors is reasonable because it covers a significant portion of the list, ensuring that even if the minimal angle is far apart in the sorted list, it will still be checked.

3. **Handling Large `n`**:
   - The algorithm should work correctly for large `n` because it uses a sliding window approach, ensuring that all relevant angles are checked without missing any.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

#### Input:
```
4
1 0
0 1
-1 0
0 -1
```

1. **Vectors**:
   - After sorting based on polar angle, the vectors are:
     - (1, 0)
     - (0, 1)
     - (-1, 0)
     - (0, -1)

2. **Minimal Angle Calculation**:
   - The minimal angle between (1, 0) and (-1, 0) is π, and similarly for other pairs like (0, 1) and (0, -1).
   - The program will correctly identify these pairs as the minimal angle is π, and the minimal angle is found within the first 100 vectors.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly sorts the vectors by their polar angle and then checks the angle with the next 100 vectors. This approach ensures that all possible pairs are considered, and the minimal angle is identified correctly. The window size of 100 is sufficient to handle cases where the minimal angle is far apart in the sorted list.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
