Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle by sorting the vectors in polar order and then comparing pairs within a small window. However, this approach might miss the minimal angle for certain configurations of vectors. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
1 0
0 1
-1 0
0 -1
```

Expected output: Any pair of opposite vectors (e.g., (1, 3) or (2, 4)) since the non-oriented angle between opposite vectors is Ï€.

However, the program might not correctly identify these pairs due to its limited window size in the nested loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))
```

When `n` is large, this loop might not cover all possible pairs, especially for vectors far apart in the sorted list. In the given example, the program might only compare vectors close to each other in the sorted list, failing to detect the minimal angle between opposite vectors.

Thus, the program does not guarantee to find the minimal non-oriented angle for every potential case, making it incorrect.
