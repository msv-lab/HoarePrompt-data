You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates and finds a pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. It first reads the number of vectors `n` and then reads each vector's coordinates. After sorting the vectors based on their polar angles, it iterates through the list to find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle. If multiple pairs have the same smallest angle, it returns the first pair found. The function prints the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. The function does not return a value directly but prints the result. Edge cases include handling a list with only two vectors and ensuring that the angle calculations are accurate even when vectors are very close to being collinear.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2`, which ensures the vectors are ordered by their angles relative to the positive x-axis. This is necessary to handle the circular nature of angles.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors in the sorted list (with a maximum of 100 pairs due to the loop condition `for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`). This approach is efficient because it leverages the sorted order to minimize the number of calculations needed.
4. **Finding Minimum Angle**: The smallest angle is tracked using the variable `ans_angle`. Whenever a smaller angle is found, the corresponding indices are updated.
5. **Output**: Finally, the indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing.

### Key Points:
- **Sorting by Angle**: Sorting by `math.atan2` is correct as it ensures the angles are in the right order.
- **Efficient Pair Calculation**: Limiting the number of pairs to be checked to `min(n, i + 100)` is a reasonable optimization, especially given the large constraints on `n`.
- **Correct Angle Calculation**: The angle calculation using `math.acos` is correct but could be simplified using the dot product formula directly, which avoids potential precision issues with `acos`.

Given the logic and implementation details, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

Correctness: **True**
