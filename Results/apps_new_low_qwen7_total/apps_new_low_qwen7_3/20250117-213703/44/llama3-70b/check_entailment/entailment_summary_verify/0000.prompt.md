You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given the set of vectors on the plane, each of them starting at the origin. Your task is to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them.

Non-oriented angle is non-negative value, minimal between clockwise and counterclockwise direction angles. Non-oriented angle is always between 0 and π. For example, opposite directions vectors have angle equals to π.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of vectors.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x|, |y| ≤ 10 000, x^2 + y^2 > 0) — the coordinates of the i-th vector. Vectors are numbered from 1 to n in order of appearing in the input. It is guaranteed that no two vectors in the input share the same direction (but they still can have opposite directions).


-----Output-----

Print two integer numbers a and b (a ≠ b) — a pair of indices of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. You can print the numbers in any order. If there are many possible answers, print any.


-----Examples-----

- Program:
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates and finds a pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. It first reads the number of vectors `n` and then reads each vector's coordinates. After sorting the vectors based on their polar angles, it iterates through the list to find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle. If multiple pairs have the same smallest angle, it returns the first pair found. The function prints the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. The function does not return a value directly but prints the result. Edge cases include handling a list with only two vectors and ensuring that the angle calculations are accurate even when vectors are very close to being collinear.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle by sorting the vectors in polar order and then comparing pairs within a small window. However, this approach might miss the minimal angle for certain configurations of vectors. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
1 0
0 1
-1 0
0 -1
```

Expected output: Any pair of opposite vectors (e.g., (1, 3) or (2, 4)) since the non-oriented angle between opposite vectors is π.

However, the program might not correctly identify these pairs due to its limited window size in the nested loop:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))
```

When `n` is large, this loop might not cover all possible pairs, especially for vectors far apart in the sorted list. In the given example, the program might only compare vectors close to each other in the sorted list, failing to detect the minimal angle between opposite vectors.

Thus, the program does not guarantee to find the minimal non-oriented angle for every potential case, making it incorrect.
