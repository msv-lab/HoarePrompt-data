Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of vectors `n` and the coordinates of each vector.
2. The vectors are stored in a list `v`.
3. The vectors are sorted based on their angle relative to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2`.
4. A nested loop is used to calculate the angles between every pair of vectors within a limited range (up to 100 vectors ahead to reduce computational complexity).
5. The program calculates the cosine of the angle between each pair of vectors using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.
6. The angles are compared to find the minimum angle, and the indices of the vectors forming this angle are stored.
7. Finally, the indices of the vectors with the minimum angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 since indices start from 0.

The logic is sound and follows a reasonable approach to finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle. However, there are a few minor issues and potential improvements:

- The calculation of the cosine of the angle should directly use the absolute value of the dot product divided by the product of the magnitudes, without intermediate steps that could introduce floating-point precision errors.
- The inner loop can be optimized to avoid calculating the angle for pairs that are too far apart, which might not significantly impact the result due to the sorting step.
- The program assumes that the `math.atan2` values will be unique, but since we sort the vectors by their angles, the comparison logic should work correctly.

Despite these minor points, the core logic is correct, and the program should function as intended.

Correctness: **True**
