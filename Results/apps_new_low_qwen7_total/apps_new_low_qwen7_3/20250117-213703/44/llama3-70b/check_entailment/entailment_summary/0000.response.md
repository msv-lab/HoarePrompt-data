Reasoning:

The program aims to find a pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle between them. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n`.
   - It then reads each vector's coordinates `(x, y)` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Sorting Vectors**:
   - The vectors are sorted based on their polar angles using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This ensures that the vectors are ordered in a way that allows for efficient comparison of angles.

3. **Finding Minimal Angle**:
   - The program iterates through the list of vectors and calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors after sorting.
   - The cosine formula used for angle calculation is correct: `angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / ...)`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where vectors might be very close to being collinear by using the `acos` function, which correctly computes the angle even for very small values.
   - The program ensures that it does not return a pair of the same vector by checking `i != j`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the indices of the pair of vectors with the smallest angle in a 1-based index format, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and computes the minimal non-oriented angle between any two vectors accurately.

Correctness: **True**
