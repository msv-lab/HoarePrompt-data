### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of finding the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vectors `n` and their respective coordinates.
2. **Sorting Vectors**: The vectors are sorted using `math.atan2`, which ensures the vectors are ordered by their angles relative to the positive x-axis. This is necessary to handle the circular nature of angles.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The program calculates the angle between each pair of consecutive vectors in the sorted list (with a maximum of 100 pairs due to the loop condition `for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`). This approach is efficient because it leverages the sorted order to minimize the number of calculations needed.
4. **Finding Minimum Angle**: The smallest angle is tracked using the variable `ans_angle`. Whenever a smaller angle is found, the corresponding indices are updated.
5. **Output**: Finally, the indices of the vectors with the minimal angle are printed, adjusted by adding 1 to match 1-based indexing.

### Key Points:
- **Sorting by Angle**: Sorting by `math.atan2` is correct as it ensures the angles are in the right order.
- **Efficient Pair Calculation**: Limiting the number of pairs to be checked to `min(n, i + 100)` is a reasonable optimization, especially given the large constraints on `n`.
- **Correct Angle Calculation**: The angle calculation using `math.acos` is correct but could be simplified using the dot product formula directly, which avoids potential precision issues with `acos`.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Sorting and Angle Calculation**: While the sorting by `math.atan2` is correct, the angle calculation between consecutive vectors might not cover all possible pairs. The current implementation only checks pairs within 100 steps ahead, which could miss some minimal angles if they occur further apart.
2. **Angle Calculation Simplification**: Using `math.acos` for angle calculation can lead to precision issues, especially for very small angles. However, the primary issue is the limitation in checking pairs.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases where the minimal angle occurs between vectors that are not consecutive in the sorted list but still need to be considered.

To ensure correctness, the program should consider all pairs of vectors, not just those within a fixed range. Here's a revised approach:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    v = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        v.append((x, y))
    
    v.sort(key=lambda v: math.atan2(v[1], v[0]))
    
    ans = (0, 1)
    ans_angle = math.pi
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            angle = math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / (math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) * math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2)))
            if angle < ans_angle:
                ans_angle = angle
                ans = (i, j)
    
    print(ans[0] + 1, ans[1] + 1)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program fails to check all possible pairs of vectors due to the limitation `min(n, i + 100)`. By removing this limit and considering all pairs, the program can accurately find the minimal non-oriented angle between any two vectors.

Final: **False**
