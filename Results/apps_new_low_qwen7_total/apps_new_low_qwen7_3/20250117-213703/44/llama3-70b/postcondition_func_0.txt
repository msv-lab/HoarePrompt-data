The function accepts a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates and finds a pair of vectors with the smallest angle between them. It first reads the number of vectors `n` and then reads each vector's coordinates. After sorting the vectors based on their polar angles, it iterates through the list to find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle. If multiple pairs have the same smallest angle, it returns the first pair found. The function prints the indices (1-based) of these two vectors. The function does not return a value directly but prints the result. Edge cases include handling a list with only two vectors and ensuring that the angle calculations are accurate even when vectors are very close to being collinear.
