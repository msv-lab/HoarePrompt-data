Postcondition: ***`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 2`, and `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2))`. If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `i`, `j`, and `angle`.***
