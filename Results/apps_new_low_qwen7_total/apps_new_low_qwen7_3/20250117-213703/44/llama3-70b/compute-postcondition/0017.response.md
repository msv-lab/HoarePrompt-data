The provided code does not change the values of any variables. It simply assigns the value of the `angle` variable to `ans_angle` and creates a tuple `ans` with the values of `i` and `j`.

Since the initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 2,
- `angle` is calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[2]`.

The code execution does not alter these values. Therefore, the final state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 2, angle is calculated based on the dot product of v[0] and v[2]**
