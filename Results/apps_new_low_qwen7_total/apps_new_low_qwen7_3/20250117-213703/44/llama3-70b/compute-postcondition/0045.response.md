Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `j` values starting from `i + 1` up to `min(n, i + 100)`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 5
   - `j` is 2
   - `ans_angle` remains the same as previously calculated `angle`
   - `ans` is the tuple (1, 2)

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is 5, and `j` is 2.
   - `min(n, i + 100)` is `min(5, 1 + 100)` which is 5.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the loop will continue until `j` is less than 5.

5. **Update States for Next Iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.
   - The states of `ans_angle` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head variables.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 5
   - `j` is 3
   - `ans_angle` is the same as previously calculated `angle`
   - `ans` is the tuple (1, 2)

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 5, `j` is 3, `ans_angle` is the same as previously calculated `angle`, and `ans` is the tuple (1, 2)**.
