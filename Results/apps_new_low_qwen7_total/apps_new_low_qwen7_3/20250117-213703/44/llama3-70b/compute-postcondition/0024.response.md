Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop.
   - `j` is the value it was last assigned to within the loop.
   - `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop execution.
   - `ans` is the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle` found.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - This means `i` is the variable that is being iterated over in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time the loop runs, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, it does not change.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

Given the analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop (i.e., `i + 1`), `j` is the value it was last assigned to within the loop, `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop execution, and `ans` is the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle` found.**

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop (i.e., `i + 1`), `j` is the value it was last assigned to within the loop, `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop execution, and `ans` is the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle` found.**
