Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is the value it was last assigned to within the loop, `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found during the loop execution, and `ans` is the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle` found.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - The variable `angle` is calculated using the dot product and magnitudes of vectors `v[i]` and `v[j]`.
   - If `angle` is less than the current `ans_angle`, `ans_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is updated to `(i, j)`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and is incremented inside the loop.
   - `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments with each iteration of the loop until it reaches `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - `ans_angle` is updated whenever a smaller `angle` is found.
   - `ans` is updated to the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest `angle` found.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n-1` and `j` is less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be the last value it was incremented to, and `j` will be the last value it was assigned to.
   - `ans_angle` will hold the smallest angle found among all pairs `(i, j)` where `j > i`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships between `i`, `j`, `ans_angle`, and `ans` are consistent with the loop's behavior. Each time a smaller `angle` is found, `ans_angle` and `ans` are updated accordingly.

Thus, the final output state after all executions of the loop is as described.
