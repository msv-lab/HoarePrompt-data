Postcondition: ***`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2 * v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`, and the current value of `angle` is less than `ans_angle`***
