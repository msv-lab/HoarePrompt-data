Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so initially, let's assume `i = 1`).
- `n` remains unchanged (let's assume `n = 5` for this example).
- `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the new value of `i`.
- `angle` is the last calculated angle.
- `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found.
- `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Determine the range of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Given `i = 1` and `n = 5`, the range becomes `range(1 + 1, min(5, 1 + 100))`, which simplifies to `range(2, 5)`.

2. **Condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are values of `j` in the specified range.
   - Since `i = 1` and `n = 5`, the range `2` to `4` includes valid values for `j`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is incremented to `1`.
   - `n` remains `5`.
   - `j` should be set to the last value corresponding to the new `i`, which means `j` should start from `2`.
   - `angle`, `ans`, and `ans_angle` do not directly affect whether the loop executes but are used within the loop body to find the smallest angle.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must start from `2` (the smallest possible value in the range).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 5, `j` must be 2, `angle` is some value, `ans` contains the pair `(1, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `j` taking the value `2` in the first iteration.
