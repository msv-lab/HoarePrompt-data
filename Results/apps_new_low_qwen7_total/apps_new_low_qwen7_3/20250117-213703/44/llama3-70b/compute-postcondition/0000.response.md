The provided code snippet initializes an integer `n` and an empty list `v`. However, the code does not complete the assignment by actually reading the input or appending vectors to the list `v`. Therefore, the list `v` remains empty after executing the given code block.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer (with a precondition that \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\)) and `v` is an empty list, the final state after running the provided code block will be:

Output State: **n is an integer, v is an empty list**
