Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Variable `i`**: The problem states that `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be valid to initialize `j` according to the range definition.

2. **Variable `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being assigned a value based on `i`. The range for `j` is defined as `range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100))`. This means `j` should start from `i + 1`.

3. **Variable `n`**: The loop condition depends on `n`. Specifically, `j` should not exceed `min(n, i + 100)`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` to allow the loop to start.

4. **Variables `ans_angle` and `ans`**: These variables' values don't directly affect whether the loop starts but will be updated during each iteration.

Given the initial conditions and the loop range, we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `j` to `i + 1`. Since `i` is the value it was last incremented to, it must be at least 1 to initialize `j` correctly.

Therefore, the conditions required for the loop to execute the first time are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
- `j` must be initialized to `i + 1`.

State: **`total` is irrelevant here, `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` must be `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `ans_angle` and `ans` are irrelevant for the loop initiation**. 

To summarize, the state needed for the loop to execute the first time is:
State: **`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` must be `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**.
