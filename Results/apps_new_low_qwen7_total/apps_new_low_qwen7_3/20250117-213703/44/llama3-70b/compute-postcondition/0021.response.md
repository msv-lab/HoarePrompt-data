Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 3, ans_angle is angle, ans is (0, 3)**

Explanation: The first line `ans_angle = angle` assigns the current value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. Since `angle` is initially calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[3]`, `ans_angle` takes the same value. The second line `ans = i, j` creates a tuple `ans` with the values of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `ans` becomes `(0, 3)`. No other variables are affected by the provided code block.
