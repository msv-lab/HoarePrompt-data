The given code snippet seems to be incomplete, but based on the lines provided, we can infer the following:

1. `ans_angle = angle`: This line assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`.
2. `ans = i, j`: This line creates a tuple `ans` containing the values of `i` and `j`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop.
- `j` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
- `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2 * v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`.

Since the actual values of `i`, `j`, `angle`, and `v` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values for `ans_angle` and `ans`. However, we can describe the final state based on the assignments made.

Final State: **ans_angle is the value of angle, ans is (i, j)**
