Postcondition: **`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2 * v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`, `ans_angle` is the value of `angle`, and `ans` is the tuple `(i, j)`. If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` remains unchanged and `ans` is still `(i, j)`.**
