Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the maximum value it reached.
   - `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the final value of `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `angle` is the last calculated angle.
   - `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found.
   - `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition checks if `i < n`. Since `i` is currently the maximum value it reached, the loop will not execute again if `i == n - 1`. However, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range of `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (assuming `i` was the maximum value but not yet equal to `n`).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is the next value after its maximum value, `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the new value of `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `angle` is the last calculated angle, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, and `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head variables, the only variable that changes is `i`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the new value of `i`, `n` remains unchanged, `angle` is the last calculated angle, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, and `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.**

To summarize the specific adjustment for the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged**. 

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the new value of `i`, `angle` is the last calculated angle, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, and `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.**

For clarity:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is the last value of `j` corresponding to the new value of `i`, `angle` is the last calculated angle, `ans` contains the pair `(i, j)` corresponding to the smallest angle found, and `ans_angle` holds the minimum angle found.**
