Initial State: `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 2`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2) * math.sqrt(v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`

Given Code Block:
```python
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

Analysis:
- The first line `ans_angle = angle` assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`.
- The second line `ans = i, j` creates a tuple `ans` containing the values of `i` and `j`.

Since no new variables are introduced or modified, and no operations are performed that would change the values of `i`, `j`, or `angle`, the values remain as they were before these lines were executed.

Output State: **i is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, j is i + 2, ans_angle is calculated as math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2) * math.sqrt(v[j][0]**2 + v[j][1]**2)), ans is (i, j)**
