Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 2
   - `angle` is calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[2]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `j` values starting from `i + 1` up to `min(n, i + 100)`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from `i + 1`, which is 1, and goes up to `min(n, i + 100)`).
   - Therefore, `j` will be 3.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `angle` remains unchanged as it is calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[2]`.

So, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `angle` is calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[2]`

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `angle` is calculated based on the dot product of `v[0]` and `v[2]`**
