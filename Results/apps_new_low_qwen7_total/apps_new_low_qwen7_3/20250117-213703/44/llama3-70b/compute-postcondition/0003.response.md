The only variables in the loop head are `n`, and the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given this, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0. Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we only need to adjust the state of `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
