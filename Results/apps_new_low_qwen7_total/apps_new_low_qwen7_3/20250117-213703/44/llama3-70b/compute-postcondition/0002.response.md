Output State: **n must be greater than 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, v is a list containing one tuple (x, y)**

Explanation:
- The first line takes two integers separated by a space as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so they remain as "an integer".
- The second line appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`. Therefore, `v` now contains one tuple, which is `(x, y)`.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid and unchanged by the code.
