Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. This ensures there are iterations to perform.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0, because the `range(n)` function generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.
- `v` is a list containing `n` sorted tuples `(x, y)` based on their angle with respect to the origin.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` must be 0.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 (this condition is already given).

So, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
