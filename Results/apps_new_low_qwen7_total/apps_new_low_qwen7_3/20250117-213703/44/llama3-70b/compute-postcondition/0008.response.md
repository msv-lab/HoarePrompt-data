Output State: **n is greater than 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, v is a list containing n sorted tuples (x, y) based on their angle with respect to the origin**.

Explanation:
1. The initial state has `n` greater than 0, `x` as an integer, `y` as an integer, and `v` as a list containing `n` tuples `(x, y)`.
2. The line `ans = 0, 1` initializes `ans` as a tuple `(0, 1)`.
3. The line `ans_angle = math.pi` sets `ans_angle` to the value of Ï€ (pi).

These two lines do not affect the list `v` or the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, which remain unchanged from the initial state. The crucial operation is the sorting of the list `v` using the `sort` method with a key function that sorts the tuples based on their angle with respect to the origin, calculated using `math.atan2(v[1], v[0])`.

Since the list `v` is sorted in place, the final state of `v` will contain the tuples `(x, y)` sorted according to their angles with respect to the origin, while all other variables retain their initial states.
