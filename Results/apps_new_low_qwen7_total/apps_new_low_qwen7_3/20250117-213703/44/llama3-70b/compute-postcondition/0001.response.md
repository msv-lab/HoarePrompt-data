State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer, `v` is an empty list.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(n):`.
2. The `_` is a placeholder variable used when the variable name is not needed within the loop body.
3. For the loop to execute, the expression `range(n)` must produce at least one value.
4. The function `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
5. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the start of the loop, the state of `v` being an empty list is irrelevant to whether the loop executes. The only condition that controls the execution of the loop is the value of `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
