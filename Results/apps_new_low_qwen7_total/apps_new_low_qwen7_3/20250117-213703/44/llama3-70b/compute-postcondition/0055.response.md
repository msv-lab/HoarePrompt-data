The code prints `ans[0] + 1` and `ans[1] + 1`. Since `ans` is a tuple containing the indices `(i, j)` with the smallest angle, `ans[0]` is `i` and `ans[1]` is `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. Therefore, `ans[0]` is `n-1` and `ans[1]` is `j`. After printing `ans[0] + 1` and `ans[1] + 1`, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `ans_angle`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the index such that (i, j) gives the minimum angle, `ans_angle` is the minimum angle found, `ans` is the tuple (i, j) with the smallest angle, printed values are `n`, `i` + 1 and `j` + 1.**
