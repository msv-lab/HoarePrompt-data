The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of vectors, where each vector is represented as a tuple (x_i, y_i). The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each vector satisfies the conditions |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they may have opposite directions.

The function does not explicitly return a value based on the given constraints and relationships. Therefore, we can infer that the function might be performing some operation or calculation on the list of vectors without specifying a particular output. However, based on the information provided, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of vectors, where each vector is represented as a tuple (x_i, y_i), and performs some operation or calculation on the list without explicitly returning a value.**
