The initial state is: `n` is greater than 0, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, `v` is [(5, 3)].

The code block is:
```
x, y = map(int, input().split())
v.append((x, y))
```

Here's the analysis:
1. The first line `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user and splits it into two integers. It then assigns these integers to `x` and `y`.
2. The second line `v.append((x, y))` appends a tuple containing the new values of `x` and `y` to the list `v`.

Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are 5 and 3 respectively, if we do not provide new inputs, the values of `x` and `y` will remain 5 and 3. Therefore, the tuple (5, 3) will still be appended to `v`.

However, since the problem does not specify the input, let's assume a typical scenario where the user might enter different values for `x` and `y`. For the sake of this example, let's assume the user enters '7 9'. This would mean `x` becomes 7 and `y` becomes 9, and the tuple (7, 9) would be appended to `v`.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `n` is still greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `x` is now 7
- `y` is now 9
- `v` is now [(5, 3), (7, 9)]

Output State: **n is greater than 0, x is 7, y is 9, v is [(5, 3), (7, 9)]**
