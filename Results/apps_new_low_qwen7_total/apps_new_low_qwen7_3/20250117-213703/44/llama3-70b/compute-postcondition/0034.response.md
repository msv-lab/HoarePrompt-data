Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop.
- `j` is `i + 2`.
- `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[j][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the condition `min(n, i + 100)`. Therefore, only these variables can be adjusted.
   
2. **Current Values**:
   - `j` is currently set to `i + 2` (as per the initial state).
   - The loop will increment `j` until `j` reaches the minimum of `n` or `i + 100`.

3. **Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 2` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `i + 3`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If `i + 3 < min(n, i + 100)`, the loop can execute again.
   - If `i + 3 >= min(n, i + 100)`, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be updated to `i + 3` if the condition is met.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j`.

**State:**
- `i` remains the same (value it was last incremented to within the loop).
- `j` is now `i + 3`.
- `angle` remains unchanged (as it is not affected by the loop).

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 3`, and `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0]**2 + v[j][0]**2 + v[i][1]**2 + v[j][1]**2))`**.
