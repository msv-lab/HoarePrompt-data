The initial state is that `n` must be greater than 0. The provided code block takes two integers as input, splits them using `map(int, input().split())`, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. It then appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `v`.

However, the code block does not define the list `v` before appending to it, so `v` would be created if it doesn't exist. Additionally, the code does not specify the initial value of `n`, but we know it must be greater than 0.

Since no specific values are given for `x` and `y`, let's assume the input is `5 3` (as an example). After executing the code block, `x` will be 5 and `y` will be 3, and the tuple `(5, 3)` will be appended to `v`.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, x is 5, y is 3, v is [(5, 3)]**
