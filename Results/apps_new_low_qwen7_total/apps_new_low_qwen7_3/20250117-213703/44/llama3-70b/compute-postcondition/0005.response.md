The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, and `v` is a list containing the tuple `(5, 3)`. Since the loop condition is based solely on `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, `v` is [(5, 3)]**
