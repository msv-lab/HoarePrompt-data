The initial state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `j` is 4
- `ans_angle` remains unchanged
- `ans` is (1, 3)
- `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2 * v[4][0]**2 + v[4][1]**2))`

The code snippet is:
```
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

Let's break down the effects of these lines:

1. The first line `ans_angle = angle` assigns the value of `angle` to `ans_angle`. This means `ans_angle` now holds the value of `angle`.
2. The second line `ans = i, j` reassigns the tuple `ans` to be `(i, j)`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, `ans` becomes `(1, 4)`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the final state after executing the code is:
Output State: **i is 1, n is 5, j is 4, ans_angle is the value of angle, ans is (1, 4), angle is calculated as math.acos((v[1][0] * v[4][0] + v[1][1] * v[4][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2 * v[4][0]**2 + v[4][1]**2))**
