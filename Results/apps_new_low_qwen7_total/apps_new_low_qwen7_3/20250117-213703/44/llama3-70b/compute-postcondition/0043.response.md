Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is 5, `j` is 2, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[1][0] * v[2][0] + v[1][1] * v[2][1]) / math.sqrt(v[1][0]**2 + v[1][1]**2 * v[2][0]**2 + v[2][1]**2))`

Given the code snippet:
```python
ans_angle = angle
ans = i, j
```

Let's analyze the impact of each line:

1. `ans_angle = angle`: This line assigns the value of the previously calculated `angle` to `ans_angle`. No new variables are introduced, and no other variables are modified.

2. `ans = i, j`: This line creates a tuple `ans` containing the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

No other variables are modified, and the `angle` value remains intact as it is reassigned to another variable.

Final State: **i is 1, n is 5, j is 2, ans_angle is the same as the previously calculated angle, ans is (1, 2)**
