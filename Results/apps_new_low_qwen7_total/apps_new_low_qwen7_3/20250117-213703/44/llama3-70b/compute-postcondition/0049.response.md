Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and the upper limit of the range, which is `min(n, i + 100)`. 

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 5
   - `j` is 3
   - `ans_angle` remains unchanged
   - `ans` is (1, 3)

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will run for `j` starting from 2 up to `min(5, 1 + 100)`, which is `min(5, 101) = 5`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, the next value of `j` in the loop will be 4.

5. **Update the State**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it will be incremented to 4.
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans_angle`, and `ans`) will remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 5, `j` is 4, `ans_angle` remains unchanged, and `ans` is (1, 3)**
