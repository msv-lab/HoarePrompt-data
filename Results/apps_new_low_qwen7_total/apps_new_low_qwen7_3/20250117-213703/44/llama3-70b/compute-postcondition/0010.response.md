Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The loop starts with `j` being initialized based on the range function.
   - The range function takes the form `range(start, stop)`, where `start` is `i + 1` and `stop` is `min(n, i + 100)`.

2. **Determine the Start Value of `j`**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the start value of `j` will be `i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

3. **Determine the Stop Value of `j`**:
   - The stop value of `j` is `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - Given that `i` is 0, this simplifies to `min(n, 100)`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be within the range defined by `range(1, min(n, 100))`.
   - This means `j` must be between 1 (inclusive) and `min(n, 100)` (inclusive).

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there is at least one value of `j` in the range. This requires `min(n, 100)` to be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Since `n` is already given to be greater than 0, `min(n, 100)` will always be at least 1.

### Conclusion
Given that `n` is greater than 0, `min(n, 100)` will always be at least 1, ensuring that `j` will have a valid starting value (1) and a valid stop value.

### Final State
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` will start from 1 and will be less than or equal to `min(n, 100)`.

Thus, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is within the range 1 to `min(n, 100)`**.

However, since we need to specify the exact initial state just before the loop starts, we focus on the initial values of the variables involved:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
