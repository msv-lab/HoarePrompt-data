Output State: **`i` is the value it was last incremented to within the loop, `j` is `i + 2`, `angle` is calculated as `math.acos((v[i][0] * v[j][0] + v[i][1] * v[j][1]) / math.sqrt(v[i][0] ** 2 + v[i][1] ** 2) / math.sqrt(v[j][0] ** 2 + v[j][1] ** 2))`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
