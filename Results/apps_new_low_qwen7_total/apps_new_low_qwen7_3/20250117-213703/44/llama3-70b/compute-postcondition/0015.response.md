Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + 100)):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `angle < ans_angle`, then `ans_angle` is set to `angle` and `ans` remains (0, 1). Otherwise, `ans_angle` and `ans` retain their original values.

3. **Determine the new value of `j`**:
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `min(n, i + 100)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the loop runs from `0 + 1` to `min(n, 0 + 100)`, which simplifies to `1` to `min(n, 100)`.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `2` (as the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration).
   - We need to check if `2` is within the range `1` to `min(n, 100)`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 0, `min(n, 100)` will be at least `1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.
   - `i` remains unchanged at `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**.
