Precondition: **The input is a list of vectors represented as (x, y) coordinates, where each vector starts at the origin. The length of the list is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each vector is represented by a tuple (x_i, y_i) where |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10 000 and x_i^2 + y_i^2 > 0. No two vectors have the same direction, but they may have opposite directions.**
