The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the smallest integer `n` such that the length of its string representation (`len(str(n))`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function prints the `k`-th character (0-indexed) of the string representation of `n` and returns nothing. If `k` exceeds the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of the current string representation of `n` and continues the search for the next integer `n` until the condition is met.
