### Reasoning:

The original assessment is generally accurate in its analysis, but there are a few points that can be elaborated upon and verified using the provided function summary.

1. **Initialization and Loop Logic**: The function starts with `n = 1` and iterates, incrementing `n` until the length of `str(n)` is at least `k`. This ensures that the correct number containing the `k`-th digit is found.

2. **Adjustment of `k`**: When `len(s) >= k`, the function adjusts `k` by subtracting the length of `s` from `k` and prints the appropriate digit. This step correctly positions `k` to point to the correct digit within the current number `n`.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `k` is reduced to a value less than the length of the current number `n`. At this point, `n` is the smallest number whose length is at least `k`, and the `k`-th digit of `n` is the desired output.

Given the function summary, the logic is indeed sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The function reads an integer `k`, iterates through numbers to find the one that contains the `k`-th digit, and prints the correct digit.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers. The original assessment accurately describes the solution and its correctness.
