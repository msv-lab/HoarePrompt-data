You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program:
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the smallest integer `n` such that the length of its string representation (`len(str(n))`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function prints the `k`-th character (0-indexed) of the string representation of `n` and returns nothing. If `k` exceeds the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of the current string representation of `n` and continues the search for the next integer `n` until the condition is met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the `k`-th digit within the sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers. The given solution attempts to find the exact number and the exact digit within that number at the `k`-th position.

Here’s how it works:
1. Initialize `n` to 1.
2. Iterate through increasing values of `n`, converting each `n` to a string `s`.
3. Check if the length of `s` is sufficient to reach the `k`-th digit.
4. If so, adjust `k` by subtracting the length of `s` from `k` and print the appropriate digit.
5. Continue to the next number if not.

### Analysis:
- The approach is sound because it correctly identifies the exact number and digit at the `k`-th position.
- It handles large values of `k` by iteratively reducing `k` as it moves through larger numbers.
- The loop will eventually terminate when `k` is less than the length of the current number, ensuring that the correct digit is printed.

Given these points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers.

Correctness: **True**
