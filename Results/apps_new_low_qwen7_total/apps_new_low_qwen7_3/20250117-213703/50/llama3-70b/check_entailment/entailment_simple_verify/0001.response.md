### Reasoning:

The provided program does indeed correctly implement the logic to find the \(k\)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers. Let's break down the code and verify its correctness step-by-step using the annotated version.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `n` is initialized to 1, representing the first positive integer.
   - The variable `k` is initialized to the input value, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues indefinitely until the condition in the `if` statement is met.
   - Inside the loop, the current number `n` is converted to a string `s`.

3. **Checking Length:**
   - If the length of `s` (the number of digits in `n`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that the `k`-th digit lies within the string representation of `n`.
   - In this case, the program adjusts `k` by subtracting the length of `s` from `k`. This effectively moves `k` to the position within the current number where the desired digit lies.
   - The desired digit is then printed, and the loop breaks.

4. **Adjustment and Increment:**
   - If the length of `s` is less than `k`, it means that the entire number `n` is not enough to cover `k` digits. Therefore, `k` is reduced by the length of `s`, and `n` is incremented to move to the next number.

5. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `k` is less than the length of the current number `n`, meaning the correct digit has been found and printed.

Given the above steps, the program correctly identifies the \(k\)-th digit in the sequence. The original assessment accurately describes the logic and the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the intended logic to find the \(k\)-th digit in the sequence of concatenated positive integers.
