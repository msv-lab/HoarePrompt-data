You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program: 
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), n is the smallest integer such that \(len(str(n)) \geq k\), and s is the string representation of n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the `k`-th digit within the sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers. The given solution attempts to find the exact number and the exact digit within that number at the `k`-th position.

Here’s how it works:
1. Initialize `n` to 1.
2. Iterate through increasing values of `n`, converting each `n` to a string `s`.
3. Check if the length of `s` is sufficient to reach the `k`-th digit.
4. If so, adjust `k` by subtracting the length of `s` from `k` and print the appropriate digit.
5. Continue to the next number if not.

### Analysis:
- The approach is sound because it correctly identifies the exact number and digit at the `k`-th position.
- It handles large values of `k` by iteratively reducing `k` as it moves through larger numbers.
- The loop will eventually terminate when `k` is less than the length of the current number, ensuring that the correct digit is printed.

Given these points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers.

Correctness: **True**
