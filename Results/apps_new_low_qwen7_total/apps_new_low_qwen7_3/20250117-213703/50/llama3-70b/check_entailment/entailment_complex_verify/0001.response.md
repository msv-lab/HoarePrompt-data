### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic and reasoning behind the program. Let's break down the program step-by-step using the annotated code and verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is read from input and converted to an integer.
   - `n` is initialized to 1.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues indefinitely until the desired digit is found.
   - For each `n`, convert `n` to its string representation `s`.
   - Check if the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Adjustment and Printing**:
   - If `len(s) >= k`, print the `(k-1)`-th character of `s` and break out of the loop.
   - If `len(s) < k`, adjust `k` by subtracting `len(s)` from `k` and increment `n` to check the next number.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop ensures that `k` is reduced until it is within the length of the current number `n`, at which point the correct digit is printed.

### Verification:

- **Edge Case**: If `k` is exactly the length of `s`, the program will print the last character of `s` and terminate.
- **General Case**: For any `k` within the constraints, the program will correctly identify the appropriate number `n` and the exact position of the digit.
- **Infinite Sequence**: The program will continue to iterate through numbers until it finds the exact position, ensuring no digits are missed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers. The reasoning and steps in the original assessment accurately reflect the program's behavior and logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given annotations.
