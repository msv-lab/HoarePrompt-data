You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5

- Program: 
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12.
def func():
    k = int(input())

n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        
        k -= len(s)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: k is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), n is the smallest integer such that \(len(str(n)) \geq k\), and s is the string representation of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the smallest integer `n` such that the length of its string representation (`len(str(n))`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function prints the `k`-th character (0-indexed) of the string representation of `n` and returns nothing. If `k` exceeds the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of the current string representation of `n` and continues the search for the next integer `n` until the condition is met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly identify the \(k\)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `n` to 1 and iterates, checking the length of the string representation of `n`.
2. If the length of the string representation of `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the desired digit is within the string representation of `n`. The program then prints the character at position `k-1` and breaks out of the loop.
3. Otherwise, it subtracts the length of the string from `k` and increments `n` to continue searching.
4. This approach ensures that the program will eventually find the correct digit because it systematically searches through each number's digits until the desired position is reached.

Given the structure of the sequence and the logic implemented, the program should work for any valid \(k\) within the specified range. Therefore, no counterexample was found, indicating the program is correct.
