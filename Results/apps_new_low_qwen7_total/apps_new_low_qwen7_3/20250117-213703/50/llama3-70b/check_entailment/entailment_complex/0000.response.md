Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic needed to find the \(k\)-th digit in the sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers.
2. The loop runs until the length of the string representation of \(n\) is at least \(k\).
3. Within the loop, the program adjusts \(k\) to account for the digits already processed and increments \(n\) to continue searching for the next integer.
4. Once the loop exits, it prints the \((k-1)\)-th character of the string representation of \(n\), which is the correct \(k\)-th digit in the sequence.

Given the problem statement and the annotated explanation, the provided program logically follows the steps necessary to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
