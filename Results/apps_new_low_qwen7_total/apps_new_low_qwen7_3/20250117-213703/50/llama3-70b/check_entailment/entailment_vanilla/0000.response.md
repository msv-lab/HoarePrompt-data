Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the `k`-th digit within the sequence formed by concatenating all positive integers. The given solution attempts to find the exact number and the exact digit within that number at the `k`-th position.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. Initialize `n` to 1.
2. Iterate through increasing values of `n`, converting each `n` to a string `s`.
3. Check if the length of `s` is sufficient to reach the `k`-th digit.
4. If so, adjust `k` by subtracting the length of `s` from `k` and print the appropriate digit.
5. Continue to the next number if not.

### Analysis:
- The approach is sound because it correctly identifies the exact number and digit at the `k`-th position.
- It handles large values of `k` by iteratively reducing `k` as it moves through larger numbers.
- The loop will eventually terminate when `k` is less than the length of the current number, ensuring that the correct digit is printed.

Given these points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers.

Correctness: **True**
