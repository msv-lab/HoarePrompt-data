Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

# Program:
def func():
    k = int(input())
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) >= k:
            print(s[k - 1])
            break
        k -= len(s)
        n += 1





# Execution Summary:
The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the smallest integer `n` such that the length of its string representation (`len(str(n))`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function prints the `k`-th character (0-indexed) of the string representation of `n` and returns nothing. If `k` exceeds the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of the current string representation of `n` and continues the search for the next integer `n` until the condition is met.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
