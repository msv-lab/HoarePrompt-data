Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the \(k\)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers.
2. The program iteratively increases an integer `n` and checks the length of its string representation.
3. When the length of `str(n)` is sufficient to contain the \(k\)-th digit, it prints the appropriate digit and breaks out of the loop.
4. This approach correctly identifies the right integer `n` and the exact digit within that integer that corresponds to the \(k\)-th position in the concatenated sequence.
5. The logic for adjusting `k` when the current number's length is insufficient ensures that the search space is correctly narrowed down.

Given the reasoning above, the program should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
