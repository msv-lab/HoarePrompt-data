### Reasoning:

The annotated program aims to find the \(k\)-th digit in the sequence of concatenated positive integers. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `k` is set to the input value which is the position of the digit we need to find.
2. **Loop until the correct digit is found**: 
   - The loop increments `n` and converts it to a string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the current number `n` contains the required digit.
   - The digit at position `k` in `s` is printed, and the loop breaks.
   - If `s` does not contain enough digits to reach `k`, the remaining part of `k` (i.e., `k -= len(s)`) is adjusted by subtracting the length of `s` from `k`, and the next number `n + 1` is considered.
3. **Break condition**: Once the correct digit is found, the loop exits, and the program prints the digit.

The logic in the annotated program correctly handles the problem. The loop ensures that the correct digit is found and printed, considering the 1-based indexing.

### Correctness:

Given the logic described above, the annotated program correctly finds the \(k\)-th digit in the sequence of concatenated positive integers.

**Correctness: **True**
