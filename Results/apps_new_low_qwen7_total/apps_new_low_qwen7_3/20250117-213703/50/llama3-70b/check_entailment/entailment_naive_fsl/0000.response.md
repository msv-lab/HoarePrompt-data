Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly identify the \(k\)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of all positive integers. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `n` to 1 and iterates, checking the length of the string representation of `n`.
2. If the length of the string representation of `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the desired digit is within the string representation of `n`. The program then prints the character at position `k-1` and breaks out of the loop.
3. Otherwise, it subtracts the length of the string from `k` and increments `n` to continue searching.
4. This approach ensures that the program will eventually find the correct digit because it systematically searches through each number's digits until the desired position is reached.

Given the structure of the sequence and the logic implemented, the program should work for any valid \(k\) within the specified range. Therefore, no counterexample was found, indicating the program is correct.
