Functionality: **The function reads an integer `k` from the user, where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It then finds the smallest integer `n` such that the length of its string representation (`len(str(n))`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function prints the `k`-th character (0-indexed) of the string representation of `n` and returns nothing. If `k` exceeds the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting the length of the current string representation of `n` and continues the search for the next integer `n` until the condition is met.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is exactly the length of the string representation of `n`, the function will print the last character of `n`.
- If `k` is greater than the length of the string representation of `n`, `k` is reduced by the length of `n` and the process repeats with the next integer `n`.
- The function handles the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^{12}\)) by iteratively finding the correct `n` and adjusting `k` accordingly.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations and the code do not explicitly state that the function will handle cases where `k` is larger than the length of the string representation of `n`. However, the code inherently includes this handling through the loop and the adjustment of `k`.
