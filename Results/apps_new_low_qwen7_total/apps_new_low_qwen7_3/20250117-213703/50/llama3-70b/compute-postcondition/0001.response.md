Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of any variables.

2. There are no conditions in the loop header that depend on any specific variable values; therefore, no modifications are necessary to the given states to ensure the loop executes the first time.

3. The variable `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), but this value does not affect whether the loop will execute since the loop condition is `True`.

4. The variable `n` is 1, and since there are no conditions involving `n` in the loop header, `n` does not affect the loop's execution either.

Given that the loop will always execute at least once due to `while True`, no adjustments are needed to the states provided.

Answer:
State: **`k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), `n` is 1**
