Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, n is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `k = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `k`. Since the initial state of `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^12, after executing this line, `k` retains its original value within this range.
- The second line `n = 1` initializes the variable `n` to 1. No change is made to the variable `k` or any other variables, so `k` still holds its original value.
- Therefore, the final state includes both `k` with its unchanged value and `n` set to 1.
