The code `print('Yes')` does not affect any variables. It only prints the string 'Yes' to the console. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, z is a non-negative integer, deficit_blue is a non-negative integer, deficit_violet is a non-negative integer, deficit_orange is a non-negative integer, extra_blue is a non-negative integer, extra_violet is a non-negative integer, extra_orange is a non-negative integer, extra_spheres is a non-negative integer, total_deficit is a non-negative integer, and the current value of extra_spheres is greater than or equal to total_deficit.**
