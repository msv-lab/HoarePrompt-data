Postcondition: ***a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit are non-negative integers. If `extra_spheres` is greater than or equal to `total_deficit`, then the function does nothing (the values remain unchanged). Otherwise, the function does nothing (the values remain unchanged as well, since there's no specific operation mentioned in the else part other than stating the condition).***
