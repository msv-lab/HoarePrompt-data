The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but rather uses local variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 1,000,000\) and \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1,000,000\). 

Based on the provided output cases, the function returns different values depending on the conditions met:

- **Case_1:** The function returns a specific value or condition related to the comparison of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- **Case_2:** The function returns another specific value or condition related to the comparison of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Since the exact conditions and return values are not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and the fact that there are multiple return points.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but uses local variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 1,000,000\) and \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1,000,000\), and returns a value based on specific conditions involving these variables.**
