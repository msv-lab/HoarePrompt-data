The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. However, this does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, z is a non-negative integer, deficit_blue is a non-negative integer, deficit_violet is a non-negative integer, deficit_orange is a non-negative integer, extra_blue is a non-negative integer, extra_violet is a non-negative integer, extra_orange is a non-negative integer, extra_spheres is a non-negative integer, total_deficit is a non-negative integer, extra_spheres is less than total_deficit**
