Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and uses local variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 1,000,000\) and \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1,000,000\). It calculates the deficit and excess of each variable (`a`, `b`, `c`) compared to (`x`, `y`, `z`). Specifically, it computes the deficits where `x > a`, `y > b`, and `z > c`, and the excesses where `a > x`, `b > y`, and `c > z`. It then determines the total number of "extra" spheres available, which is half the sum of the excesses rounded down. Finally, it checks if the total number of extra spheres is sufficient to cover the total deficit. If the total number of extra spheres is enough, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. There are no additional actions taken if the total number of extra spheres is insufficient.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are exactly equal to `x`, `y`, or `z`, respectively, there will be no deficit or excess, and thus the `extra_spheres` calculation will be zero.
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are less than `x`, `y`, or `z`, respectively, the deficits will be calculated correctly, but the excesses will be zero.
- The function does not modify the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`; it only uses them for calculations.
