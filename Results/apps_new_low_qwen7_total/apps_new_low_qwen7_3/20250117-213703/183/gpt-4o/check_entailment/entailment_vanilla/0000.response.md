Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the initial number of blue, violet, and orange spheres from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. It then calculates the deficit for each color (the difference between the required number and the current number of spheres).
3. It also calculates the excess number of spheres of each color that can be used to create new spheres of other colors.
4. The program then calculates the total number of additional spheres available by halving the excess spheres (since two spheres of the same color can be transformed into one of another color).
5. Finally, it compares the total deficit needed with the total excess spheres available. If there are enough excess spheres to cover the total deficit, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

The logic in the program appears to be sound and correctly implements the rules for transforming spheres. Given the constraints and the transformation rule, this approach should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
