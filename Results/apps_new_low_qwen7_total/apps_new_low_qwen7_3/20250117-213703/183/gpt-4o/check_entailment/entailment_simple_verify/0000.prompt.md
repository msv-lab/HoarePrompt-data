You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Carl is a beginner magician. He has a blue, b violet and c orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least x blue, y violet and z orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.

The second line of the input contains three integers, x, y and z (0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.


-----Output-----

If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4 0
2 1 2

Output
Yes

Input
5 6 1
2 7 2

Output
No

Input
3 3 3
2 2 2

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample the wizard has 4 blue and 4 violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have 2 blue and 5 violet spheres. Then he turns 4 violet spheres into 2 orange spheres and he ends up with 2 blue, 1 violet and 2 orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.

- Program: 
def func():
    (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)
    deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)
    deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)
    extra_blue = max(0, a - x)
    extra_violet = max(0, b - y)
    extra_orange = max(0, c - z)
    extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2
    total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if extra_spheres >= total_deficit:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1,000,000, and x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

deficit_blue = max(0, x - a)

deficit_violet = max(0, y - b)

deficit_orange = max(0, z - c)

extra_blue = max(0, a - x)

extra_violet = max(0, b - y)

extra_orange = max(0, c - z)

extra_spheres = extra_blue // 2 + extra_violet // 2 + extra_orange // 2

total_deficit = deficit_blue + deficit_violet + deficit_orange
    if (extra_spheres >= total_deficit) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c, x, y, z, deficit_blue, deficit_violet, deficit_orange, extra_blue, extra_violet, extra_orange, extra_spheres, and total_deficit are non-negative integers. If `extra_spheres` is greater than or equal to `total_deficit`, then the function does nothing (the values remain unchanged). Otherwise, the function does nothing (the values remain unchanged as well, since there's no specific operation mentioned in the else part other than stating the condition).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extra spheres is insufficient to cover the total deficit correctly. Specifically, the program calculates `extra_spheres` as the sum of half the extra blue, violet, and orange spheres, but this approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the extra spheres can only be used to reduce the deficit in a way that respects the transformation rule (two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color).

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
5 6 1
2 7 2
```
- The magician starts with 5 blue, 6 violet, and 1 orange spheres.
- He needs 2 blue, 7 violet, and 2 orange spheres.

Here, the deficits are:
- Deficit blue: \(2 - 5 = -3\) (which means he has 3 extra blue spheres).
- Deficit violet: \(7 - 6 = 1\) (which means he needs 1 more violet sphere).
- Deficit orange: \(2 - 1 = 1\) (which means he needs 1 more orange sphere).

The program incorrectly calculates:
- Extra blue: \(5 - 2 = 3\)
- Extra violet: \(6 - 7 = -1\) (which means he has 1 extra violet sphere).
- Extra orange: \(1 - 2 = -1\) (which means he has 1 extra orange sphere).

The total extra spheres are calculated as:
\[ \text{extra\_spheres} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \]

Since the total deficit is 2 (1 violet and 1 orange), the program would incorrectly conclude that the extra spheres are sufficient, even though the magician cannot transform the extra blue spheres into violet or orange spheres in a way that meets the deficit.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the extra spheres can be used to reduce the deficit in a valid manner. One way to do this is to check if the sum of half the extra blue and violet spheres plus the extra orange spheres is greater than or equal to the total deficit.
