The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).

The function returns one of the following:
- Case_1: The program returns 'No'.
- Case_2: The program returns 'No'.
- Case_3: 'Yes\n' followed by the elements of list 'bits' joined into a single string separated by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, it returns either 'No', 'No', or 'Yes' followed by a list of bits as a single string separated by spaces.
