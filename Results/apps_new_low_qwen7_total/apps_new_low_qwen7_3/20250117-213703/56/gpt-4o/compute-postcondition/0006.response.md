The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. Initially, `bits` is an empty list. After executing `bits.append(i)`, the value of `i` (which is 60) is added to `bits`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing [60]**
