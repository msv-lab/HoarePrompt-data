The initial state is as follows:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is -1
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest bit set in `n` (inclusive), and `len(bits)` must be less than `k`

The code snippet to execute is:
```
smallest = bits.pop()
bits.append(smallest - 1)
bits.append(smallest - 1)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `smallest = bits.pop()`: This line pops the last element from the `bits` list and assigns it to `smallest`. Let's assume the last element in `bits` is `x` (the actual value of `x` depends on the specific `bits` list, but we'll keep it as `x` for now).

2. `bits.append(smallest - 1)`: After popping the last element, this line appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. Since `smallest` is `x`, this adds `x - 1` to the list.

3. `bits.append(smallest - 1)`: This line repeats the previous operation, appending another `smallest - 1` (which is `x - 1`) to the `bits` list.

So, after these operations, the `bits` list will have the following structure:
- All elements except the last one remain unchanged.
- The last two elements of `bits` are now `x - 1`.

Since no other variables are affected, the final state remains:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is -1
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is a list where the last two elements are each `x - 1`, and all other elements are unchanged from the original `bits` list

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **total is 10, i is -1, n is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), bits is a list where the last two elements are each smallest - 1, and all other elements are unchanged from the original bits list**
