Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. If not, it constructs a list `bits` containing the indices of the bits set in `n`. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it manipulates the `bits` list by decrementing the smallest element twice for each iteration until its length equals `k`. Finally, it sorts the `bits` list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of `bits` as a single string separated by spaces.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is zero (`n == 0`), the function will return 'No' because there are no bits set in `n`.
- If `k` is zero (`k == 0`), the function will also return 'No' since the condition `len(bits) > k` would be true.
- If `k` is equal to the number of bits set in `n`, the function will return 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of those bit indices.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer within the specified ranges. However, there are no checks for these constraints in the code. If `n` is negative or `k` is zero, the function will still proceed with the logic without checking these preconditions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
