To determine the required states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the structure of the loop.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` is an empty list.
- The loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 (inclusive) in reverse order.

The loop header:
```
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables**: The loop control variable in this case is `i`, which is initialized to 60 and decremented until it reaches -1.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the `range()` function, i.e., `60` (the starting value).

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `n` is already defined but not relevant for the first iteration of the loop since the loop does not use `n` directly.
   - `k` is also already defined but similarly, it is not directly involved in the loop's first iteration.
   - `bits` is an empty list, and again, it is not used in the first iteration of the loop.

4. **State of `i` at the Start of the Loop**: The loop will execute for the first time when `i` is 60.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is the value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 60, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is an empty list**.
