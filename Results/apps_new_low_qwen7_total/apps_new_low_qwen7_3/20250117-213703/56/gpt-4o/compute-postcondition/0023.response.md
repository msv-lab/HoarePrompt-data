Initial State: `total` is 10, `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `len(bits)` is less than `k`, and `smallest` is undefined.

Code Block:
```python
smallest = bits.pop()
bits.append(smallest - 1)
bits.append(smallest - 1)
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `smallest = bits.pop()` pops the last element from `bits` and assigns it to `smallest`. This changes the value of `smallest` and reduces the length of `bits` by 1.
2. The second line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends `smallest - 1` to `bits`. This increases the length of `bits` by 1.
3. The third line `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends another `smallest - 1` to `bits`. This increases the length of `bits` by 1 again.

Combining these effects:
- The length of `bits` decreases by 1 due to the `pop` operation.
- The length of `bits` increases by 2 due to the two `append` operations.

Therefore, the net effect is that the length of `bits` increases by 1. The value of `smallest` is now the last element that was popped from `bits`, and `bits` contains the new elements `smallest - 1` appended twice.

Final Output State: **total is 10, i is -1, n is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), len(bits) is 1 more than its previous value, smallest is the element popped from bits, and the last two elements in bits are smallest - 1 and smallest - 1.**
