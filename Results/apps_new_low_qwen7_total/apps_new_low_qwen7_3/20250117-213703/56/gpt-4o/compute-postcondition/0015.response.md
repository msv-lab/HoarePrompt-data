Postcondition: **`total` is 10, `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest bit set in `n` (inclusive). The length of `bits` is greater than `k`.**
