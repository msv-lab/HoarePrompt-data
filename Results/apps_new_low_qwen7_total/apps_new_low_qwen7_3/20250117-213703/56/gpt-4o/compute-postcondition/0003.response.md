The code initializes an empty list `bits`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n; `bits` is an empty list**
