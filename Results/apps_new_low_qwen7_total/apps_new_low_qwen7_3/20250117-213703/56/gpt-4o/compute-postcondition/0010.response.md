Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is 59, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list. If `n >> i & 1` is true, then `bits` contains `[60, 59]`. Otherwise, `bits` remains `[59]` (or empty if it was initially empty).***
