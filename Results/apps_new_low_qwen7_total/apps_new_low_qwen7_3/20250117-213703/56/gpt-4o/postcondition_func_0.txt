The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. If not, it constructs a list `bits` containing the indices of the bits set in `n`. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it manipulates the `bits` list by decrementing the smallest element twice for each iteration until its length equals `k`. Finally, it sorts the `bits` list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of `bits` as a single string separated by spaces.
