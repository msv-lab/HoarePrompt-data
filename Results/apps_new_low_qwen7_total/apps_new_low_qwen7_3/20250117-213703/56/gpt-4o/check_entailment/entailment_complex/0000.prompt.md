Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 10, `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest bit set in `n` (inclusive).
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `total` is 10, `i` is -1, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing all indices `i` from 60 down to the highest bit set in `n` (inclusive). The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: - Since the loop continues until `len(bits) == k`, the final state of `bits` will be a list with exactly `k` elements, where each element is the result of decrementing the smallest element of the previous list twice.
    #   - `total` and `i` remain unchanged.
    #   - `n` remains unchanged.
    #   - `k` remains unchanged.
    #   - `bits` will have `k` elements, with the last two being the smallest element of the final list minus one, and the rest of the elements will be derived from the previous iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #The final output state after the loop has executed all necessary iterations to reach `len(bits) == k` is:
    #
    #Output State:
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #'Yes\n' followed by the elements of list 'bits' joined into a single string separated by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\)). It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. If not, it constructs a list `bits` containing the indices of the bits set in `n`. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it manipulates the `bits` list by decrementing the smallest element twice for each iteration until its length equals `k`. Finally, it sorts the `bits` list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of `bits` as a single string separated by spaces.
