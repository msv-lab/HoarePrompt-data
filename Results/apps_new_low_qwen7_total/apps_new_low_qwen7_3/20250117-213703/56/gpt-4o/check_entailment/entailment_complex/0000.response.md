Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find `k` integers such that their binary representation sums up to `n`, ensuring the largest integer in the list is minimized and the resulting list is lexicographically largest. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness of each part of the program:

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - The program first checks if `k > n`. If true, it immediately returns 'No', correctly handling cases where it's impossible to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of 2.

2. **Bit Extraction**:
   - The program extracts the bits set in `n` using a loop that iterates from 60 down to 0. This correctly identifies the significant bits (positions) contributing to the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Handling Bit Length**:
   - If the number of bits extracted (`len(bits)`) exceeds `k`, the program returns 'No', correctly addressing cases where the required number of terms is insufficient.

4. **Adjusting Bits to Meet `k`**:
   - If the number of bits is less than `k`, the program appends the smallest bit position twice until the list size matches `k`. This ensures that the sum of powers of 2 still equals `n` while meeting the required count `k`.

5. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After adjusting the bit positions, the program sorts the list in reverse order to ensure the lexicographically largest sequence is produced. Then, it outputs 'Yes' followed by the sequence of integers corresponding to these bit positions.

Considering all these steps, the program accurately follows the problem requirements and constraints. Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
