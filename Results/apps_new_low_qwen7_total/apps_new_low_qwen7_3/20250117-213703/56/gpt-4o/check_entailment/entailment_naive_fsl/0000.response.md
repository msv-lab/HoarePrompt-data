Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of powers of 2 needs to be achieved with a specific number of terms (`k`), and it fails to ensure the lexicographically largest sequence is returned. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate this:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
10 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
3 1 0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
```

**Reasoning:**
- According to the problem description, we need to find three integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) such that \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + 2^{a_3} = 10\).
- The lexicographically largest sequence with the smallest maximum element would be \(3, 1, 0\), since \(2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 10\).
- However, the provided program returns "No", indicating it cannot produce the required sequence, which is incorrect.

This counterexample shows that the program fails to generate the correct sequence under certain conditions, hence the correctness is **False**.
