Reasoning:

1. The program reads input values for `n` and `k` correctly and passes them to the `func_1` function.
2. The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If true, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct since we cannot represent `n` with `k` terms if `k` is larger than `n`.
3. It then identifies the binary representation of `n` by finding the highest set bit (from 60 down to 0) and appends these bit positions to the `bits` list. This correctly identifies the powers of 2 used to represent `n`.
4. It checks if the number of bits required to represent `n` exceeds `k`. If true, it returns 'No', indicating that the desired sequence cannot be formed due to insufficient terms.
5. If both checks pass, the function ensures that the `bits` list contains exactly `k` elements by appending smaller values (by decrementing the smallest element found so far). This step ensures that the sequence is as short as possible, which aligns with the problem statement's requirement.
6. Finally, the function sorts the `bits` list in reverse order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically largest and returns the appropriate output.

Given the detailed steps and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct in addressing the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
