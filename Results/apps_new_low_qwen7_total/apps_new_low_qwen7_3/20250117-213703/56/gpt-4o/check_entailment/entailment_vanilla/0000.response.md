Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by finding \(k\) integers such that the sum of \(2^{a_i}\) equals \(n\), and the largest integer in the answer is minimized. Additionally, among all such sequences, it should return the lexicographically largest one.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input from standard input, which is handled correctly.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if \(k\) is greater than \(n\). If so, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it’s impossible to represent \(n\) using fewer terms than \(n\) itself.
   - It calculates the binary representation of \(n\) by iterating from 60 down to -1. This approach ensures that we capture the highest possible bit positions first.
   - If the number of set bits (bits that contribute to the sum) exceeds \(k\), it returns 'No'. This is also correct because having more than \(k\) bits means it’s not possible to form the desired sequence with \(k\) elements.
   - If there are enough bits to form the sequence, it starts filling the remaining slots by decrementing the smallest bit found so far to ensure the sequence remains minimal in maximum value and maximizes lexicographical order.
   - Finally, it sorts the resulting list in descending order to get the lexicographically largest sequence and outputs 'Yes' followed by the sequence.

The program handles the constraints and requirements correctly. It ensures the sum condition is met, minimizes the maximum value, and produces the lexicographically largest sequence.

Correctness: **True**
