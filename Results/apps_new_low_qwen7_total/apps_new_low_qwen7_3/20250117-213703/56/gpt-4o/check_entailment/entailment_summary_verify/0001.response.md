### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Input Handling
- The program reads input from standard input correctly using `sys.stdin.read`.
- The input is split into `n` and `k`.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Check if \(k > n\)**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'. This check is correct because it's impossible to represent \(n\) using more terms than \(n\) itself.

2. **Calculate Binary Representation**:
   - The function iterates from 60 down to -1 to find the bits set in `n`. This ensures that we capture the highest possible bit positions first.
   - If the number of set bits exceeds `k`, it returns 'No'. This is correct because having more than `k` bits means it's not possible to form the desired sequence with `k` elements.

3. **Manipulate Bits**:
   - If the number of set bits is less than `k`, the function needs to manipulate the bits to ensure the sequence has exactly `k` elements.
   - The function pops the smallest bit from the `bits` list and appends `smallest - 1` twice. This ensures that the resulting sequence has the minimum possible maximum value.
   - The purpose of sorting the `bits` list in reverse order at the end is to produce the lexicographically largest sequence.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the `bits` list, which are sorted in reverse order.

#### Correctness Analysis
- **Handling of \(k > n\)**: The check is correct.
- **Binary Representation Calculation**: The logic for calculating the binary representation and ensuring the number of set bits does not exceed `k` is correct.
- **Manipulating Bits**: The logic for manipulating the bits to ensure the sequence has exactly `k` elements is correct. Decrementing the smallest bit and appending it twice ensures the sequence is minimal in maximum value.
- **Sorting and Lexicographical Order**: Sorting the `bits` list in reverse order ensures the lexicographically largest sequence is produced.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
