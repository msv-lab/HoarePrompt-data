### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the program and its correctness in handling the constraints and requirements of the problem. However, let's go through the program step-by-step to validate the behavior and reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` from standard input and passes them to the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Check if \(k > n\)**:
     - If `k` is greater than `n`, the function immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it is impossible to represent `n` using fewer terms than `n` itself.
   
   - **Finding the Binary Representation**:
     - The program iterates from 60 down to -1 to find the highest bit positions in the binary representation of `n`. This is done using the expression `n >> i & 1`, which checks if the `i-th` bit is set.
     - If the `i-th` bit is set, it appends `i` to the `bits` list.
   
   - **Check if Number of Set Bits Exceeds \(k\)**:
     - If the number of set bits (length of `bits`) is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'. This ensures that the sum of the powers of 2 represented by the `bits` list does not exceed `n` and fits within the constraint of having exactly `k` elements.
   
   - **Filling Remaining Slots**:
     - If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the program pops the smallest element and appends `smallest - 1` twice to ensure the sequence is minimal in maximum value and maximizes lexicographical order.
     - This process ensures that the sequence is constructed such that the maximum value is minimized and the lexicographical order is maximized.
   
   - **Sorting and Returning the Result**:
     - After constructing the sequence, the `bits` list is sorted in descending order to get the lexicographically largest sequence.
     - The function returns 'Yes' followed by the constructed sequence.

Let's validate the behavior with some test cases:

1. **Test Case: \(n = 23\), \(k = 5\)**:
   - Binary representation of 23: `10111`
   - Highest bits: `[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - Since the length of `bits` is 5 (equal to `k`), the sequence is already valid.
   - Output: `Yes 3 3 2 1 0`

2. **Test Case: \(n = 13\), \(k = 2\)**:
   - Binary representation of 13: `1101`
   - Highest bits: `[3, 2, 0]`
   - Length of `bits` is 3, which is greater than `k = 2`.
   - Output: `No`

3. **Test Case: \(n = 1\), \(k = 2\)**:
   - Binary representation of 1: `1`
   - Highest bit: `[0]`
   - Length of `bits` is 1, which is less than `k = 2`.
   - Append `0 - 1` twice: `[0, -1, -1]`
   - Output: `Yes -1 -1`

The program handles these cases correctly, ensuring that the constraints and requirements are met. The logic for minimizing the maximum value and maximizing the lexicographical order is sound.
