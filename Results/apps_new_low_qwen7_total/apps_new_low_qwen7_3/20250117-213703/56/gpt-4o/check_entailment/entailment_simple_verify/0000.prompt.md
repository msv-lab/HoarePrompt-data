You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.

        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: - Since the loop continues until `len(bits) == k`, the final state of `bits` will be a list with exactly `k` elements, where each element is the result of decrementing the smallest element of the previous list twice.
    #   - `total` and `i` remain unchanged.
    #   - `n` remains unchanged.
    #   - `k` remains unchanged.
    #   - `bits` will have `k` elements, with the last two being the smallest element of the final list minus one, and the rest of the elements will be derived from the previous iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #The final output state after the loop has executed all necessary iterations to reach `len(bits) == k` is:
    #
    #Output State:
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #'Yes\n' followed by the elements of list 'bits' joined into a single string separated by spaces



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of powers of 2 needs to be achieved with a specific number of terms (`k`), and it fails to ensure the lexicographically largest sequence is returned. Here’s a counterexample to illustrate this:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
10 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
3 1 0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
```

**Reasoning:**
- According to the problem description, we need to find three integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) such that \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + 2^{a_3} = 10\).
- The lexicographically largest sequence with the smallest maximum element would be \(3, 1, 0\), since \(2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 10\).
- However, the provided program returns "No", indicating it cannot produce the required sequence, which is incorrect.

This counterexample shows that the program fails to generate the correct sequence under certain conditions, hence the correctness is **False**.
