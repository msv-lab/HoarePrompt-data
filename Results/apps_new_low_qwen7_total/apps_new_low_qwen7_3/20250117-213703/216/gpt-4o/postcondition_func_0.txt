The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 200\) and a string `s` consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It processes the string `s` to find the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters and returns this maximum count. If `n` is not within the specified range or `s` contains characters other than lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, the function will handle these cases by ignoring them and still process the valid parts of `s`.
