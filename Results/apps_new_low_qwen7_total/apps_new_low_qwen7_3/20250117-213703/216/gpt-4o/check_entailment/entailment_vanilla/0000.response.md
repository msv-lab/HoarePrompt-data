### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Through String:**
   - The program initializes `max_count` to store the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.
   - It uses `current_set` to keep track of the distinct lowercase characters encountered so far.
   - `current_count` is used to count the number of elements in the current pretty set of positions.

2. **Processing Each Character:**
   - For each character in the string, it checks if the character is lowercase using `char.islower()`.
   - If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
   - If the character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` with the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`, and resets `current_set` and `current_count`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop ends, it performs one final check to update `max_count` with the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count` in case the string ends with a sequence of lowercase letters.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `max_count`, which represents the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where the string contains only uppercase letters or only a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters without violating the conditions of a pretty set.

Given the logic and edge cases considered, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
