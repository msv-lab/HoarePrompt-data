You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the second input line is a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

max_count = 0

current_set = set()

current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters found in `s`. `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)

print(max_count)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. It iterates through the string, maintaining a set of distinct lowercase characters encountered so far (`current_set`). When an uppercase character is encountered, it updates the maximum count of distinct lowercase characters found so far (`max_count`) and resets the `current_set` and `current_count`. After the loop, it ensures the final count is considered before printing the result. This logic handles all the constraints and examples provided, ensuring that the program works correctly for any valid input string.
