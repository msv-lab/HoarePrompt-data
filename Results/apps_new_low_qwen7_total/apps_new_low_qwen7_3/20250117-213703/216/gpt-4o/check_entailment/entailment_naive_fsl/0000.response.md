Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. It iterates through the string, maintaining a set of distinct lowercase characters encountered so far (`current_set`). When an uppercase character is encountered, it updates the maximum count of distinct lowercase characters found so far (`max_count`) and resets the `current_set` and `current_count`. After the loop, it ensures the final count is considered before printing the result. This logic handles all the constraints and examples provided, ensuring that the program works correctly for any valid input string.
