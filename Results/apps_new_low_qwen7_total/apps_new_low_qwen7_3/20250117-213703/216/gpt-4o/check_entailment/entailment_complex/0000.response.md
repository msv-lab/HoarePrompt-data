Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes `n` and reads the string `s`.
2. It uses `current_set` to keep track of unique lowercase letters encountered so far and `current_count` to count the number of these unique lowercase letters.
3. When an uppercase letter is encountered, it updates `max_count` with the current count of unique lowercase letters and resets `current_set` and `current_count`.
4. After the loop, it ensures that any remaining lowercase letters in `current_set` are considered by updating `max_count` one last time.
5. The logic handles the constraints and requirements of the problem correctly.

Given the annotations and the logic described, the function should work as intended according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
