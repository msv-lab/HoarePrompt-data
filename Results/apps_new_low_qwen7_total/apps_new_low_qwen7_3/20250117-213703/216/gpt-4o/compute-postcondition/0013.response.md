Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. `current_set` is a set of characters from `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated to include `char` and `current_count` will be incremented by 1. If `char` is a lowercase letter but already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is the maximum value between its original value and `current_count`, and `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to an empty set and 0, respectively.***
