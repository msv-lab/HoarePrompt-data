Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, max_count is 0, current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char.islower():
        if char not in current_set:
            current_set.add(char)
            current_count += 1
    else:
        max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
        current_set.clear()
        current_count = 0


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` will contain at least one additional character that is a lowercase letter, and `current_count` will be 1. Otherwise, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. `current_set` is a set of characters from `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated to include `char` and `current_count` will be incremented by 1. If `char` is a lowercase letter but already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is the maximum value between its original value and `current_count`, and `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to an empty set and 0, respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in `s`, `current_set` is a set of characters from `s` (which may or may not include the previous `char`), and `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters encountered so far in the loop (which may or may not be incremented). If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `max_count` is the maximum of its original value and `current_count`, and `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to an empty set and 0, respectively.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
