Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters found in `s`. `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - `max_count` keeps track of the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters.
   - `current_set` stores the set of currently seen unique lowercase letters.
   - `current_count` counts the number of unique lowercase letters encountered so far in the current sequence.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `max_count`: Updated whenever a new maximum of `current_count` is found.
   - `current_set`: Updated when a new lowercase letter is added; cleared when an uppercase letter is encountered.
   - `current_count`: Incremented when a new lowercase letter is added; reset to 0 when `current_set` is cleared.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` become 0 after each iteration where an uppercase letter is processed.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop processes each character in `s` exactly once.
   - For each lowercase letter, it is added to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
   - When an uppercase letter is encountered, the current sequence ends, and the maximum of `current_count` and `max_count` is stored in `max_count`. Then, `current_set` and `current_count` are reset.
   - After processing all characters, `max_count` contains the highest count of consecutive unique lowercase letters, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - `max_count` correctly reflects the maximum number of consecutive unique lowercase letters.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to their initial values because no new characters are processed after the loop exits.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is as described above.
