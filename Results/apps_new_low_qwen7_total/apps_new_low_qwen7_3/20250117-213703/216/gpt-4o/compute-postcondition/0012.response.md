Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If the next `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` will contain at least one additional character that is a lowercase letter, and `current_count` will be 1. Otherwise, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.

Code Block:
```
max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
current_set.clear()
current_count = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line updates `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is either 0 or a positive integer (1 if the next `char` is a lowercase letter), `max_count` will be updated to the higher of these two values.
- The second line clears `current_set`, making it an empty set again.
- The third line sets `current_count` to 0.

Final Output State: **max_count is the maximum value between its original value and current_count (which is 0), current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0**.
