Based on the provided code block, the program reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then initializes `max_count` to 0, `current_set` to an empty set, and `current_count` to 0. The string `s` is stored as the value of `s`, and the integer `n` is stored as the value of `n`.

Since no further operations are performed on these variables within the given code block, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, we can directly state the final output state as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, s is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, max_count is 0, current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0**
