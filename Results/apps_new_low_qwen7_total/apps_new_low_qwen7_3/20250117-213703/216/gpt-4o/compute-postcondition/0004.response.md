Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, char is a character added to current_set, current_set contains at least one additional character, current_count is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes that `s` is a non-empty string with at least one lowercase letter, `char` is a character not currently in `current_set`, and `current_set` contains at least one character not previously in `current_set`.
- The code adds `char` to `current_set`, increasing the set's size by one.
- It also increments `current_count` by 1, setting it to 1 since it was presumably 0 before this operation.
- The string `s` and the value of `char` itself are not directly used or changed within the given code snippet, so they remain in their initial state conditions as described in the precondition.
