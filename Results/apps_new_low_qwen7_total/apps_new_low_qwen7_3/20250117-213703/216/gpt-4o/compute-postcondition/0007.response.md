Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, max_count is 0, current_set is an empty set, current_count is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given where `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and there is at least one character in `s` that is not lowercase.
- The first line `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` is attempting to find the maximum count between `max_count` and `current_count`. However, since `max_count` and `current_count` are not initialized before this line, they are assumed to be 0. Therefore, this line does not change the values of `max_count` or `current_count` because both are already 0.
- The second line `current_set.clear()` clears the contents of `current_set`, making it an empty set.
- The third line `current_count = 0` sets `current_count` to 0.

Since the code does not modify `s`, it remains a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with at least one character not being lowercase. The values of `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are explicitly set to their respective values by the code.
