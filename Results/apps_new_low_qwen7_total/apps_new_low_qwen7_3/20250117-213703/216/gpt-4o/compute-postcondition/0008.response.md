Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` will contain at least one additional character that is a lowercase letter, and `current_count` will be 1. Otherwise, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.***
