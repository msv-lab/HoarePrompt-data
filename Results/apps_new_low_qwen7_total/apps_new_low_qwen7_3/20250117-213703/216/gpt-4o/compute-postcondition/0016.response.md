Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in `s`, `current_set` is a set of characters from `s` (which may or may not include the previous `char`), and `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters encountered so far in the loop (which may or may not be incremented). If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged.***
