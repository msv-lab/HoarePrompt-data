Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 200\) and a string `s` consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It processes the string `s` to find the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters and returns this maximum count. If `n` is not within the specified range or `s` contains characters other than lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, the function will handle these cases by ignoring them and still process the valid parts of `s`.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
- Reads an integer `n` from the first input line.
- Reads a string `s` from the second input line.
- Initializes `max_count` to 0, `current_set` as an empty set, and `current_count` to 0.
- Iterates through each character in `s`:
  - If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
  - If the character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` to the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, then clears `current_set` and resets `current_count` to 0.
- After the loop, it updates `max_count` one last time to ensure any trailing lowercase sequence is considered.
- Prints the final value of `max_count`.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function ignores invalid inputs (i.e., values of `n` outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 200\) and strings containing non-Latin characters) and still processes the valid parts of `s`.
- There is no explicit handling of empty strings `s`; the function will still process an empty string and return `max_count` as 0.
