Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. `current_set` is a set of characters from `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` will contain `char` (if `char` is a lowercase letter) and `current_count` will be 1 plus the number of times this code block has been executed. If `char` is already in `current_set`, the values of `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged.***
