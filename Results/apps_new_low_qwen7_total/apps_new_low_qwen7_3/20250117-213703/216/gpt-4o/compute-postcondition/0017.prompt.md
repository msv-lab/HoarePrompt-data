You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state in the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer**

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1
```
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
   - `current_set` is a set of characters from `s`.
   - If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated to include `char` and `current_count` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `char` is a lowercase letter but already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged.
   - If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is the maximum value between its original value and `current_count`, and `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to an empty set and 0, respectively.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only variables that change within the loop head are `char`, `current_set`, and `current_count`.
   - Since `char` is the current character being processed, it changes with each iteration.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` can be updated based on the condition checked inside the loop.

Given the loop head:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the last character processed.
   - We need to determine what happens in the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `char` was a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` would include this character, and `current_count` would be incremented by 1.
   - If `char` was a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` would remain unchanged.
   - If `char` was not a lowercase letter, `max_count` would be updated if necessary, and `current_set` and `current_count` would be reset.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next character in `s` will be processed.
   - If the next character is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated, and `current_count` will be incremented.
   - If the next character is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` will remain unchanged.
   - If the next character is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` will be updated if necessary, and `current_set` and `current_count` will be reset.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` may or may not change depending on the conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` is a set of characters from `s` (which may or may not include the previous `char`), and `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters encountered so far in the loop (which may or may not be incremented).
```
max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
current_set.clear()
current_count = 0

```

Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the results. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
```
