Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. If the next `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` will contain at least one additional character that is a lowercase letter, and `current_count` will be 1. Otherwise, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.

Code Block:
```
current_set.add(char)
current_count += 1
```

Analysis:
- The `current_set.add(char)` line adds the current character (`char`) to the `current_set`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, it means `current_set` was already containing at least one lowercase letter (from the precondition), and it will now contain another lowercase letter.
- The `current_count += 1` line increments `current_count` by 1. This is always true regardless of whether `char` is a lowercase or uppercase letter.

Since no specific value for `char` or `s` is provided, we can consider the general case where `char` is part of the string `s`. After running these two lines, `current_set` will either contain one more lowercase letter if `char` is lowercase, or it will remain unchanged if `char` is uppercase. `current_count` will always be incremented by 1.

Final Output State: **current_set contains at least one lowercase letter plus possibly another lowercase letter if char is lowercase, current_count is 1 plus the number of times this code block has been executed, s is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters**
