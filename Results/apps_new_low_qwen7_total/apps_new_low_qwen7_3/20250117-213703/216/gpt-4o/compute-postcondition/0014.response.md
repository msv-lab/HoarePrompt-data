Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
   - `current_set` is a set of characters from `s`.
   - If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated to include `char` and `current_count` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `char` is a lowercase letter but already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged.
   - If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is the maximum value between its original value and `current_count`, and `current_set` and `current_count` are reset to an empty set and 0, respectively.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only variables that change within the loop head are `char`, `current_set`, and `current_count`.
   - Since `char` is the current character being processed, it changes with each iteration.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` can be updated based on the condition checked inside the loop.

Given the loop head:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the last character processed.
   - We need to determine what happens in the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `char` was a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` would include this character, and `current_count` would be incremented by 1.
   - If `char` was a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` would remain unchanged.
   - If `char` was not a lowercase letter, `max_count` would be updated if necessary, and `current_set` and `current_count` would be reset.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next character in `s` will be processed.
   - If the next character is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, `current_set` will be updated, and `current_count` will be incremented.
   - If the next character is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, `current_set` and `current_count` will remain unchanged.
   - If the next character is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` will be updated if necessary, and `current_set` and `current_count` will be reset.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `current_set` and `current_count` may or may not change depending on the conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` is a set of characters from `s` (which may or may not include the previous `char`), and `current_count` is the count of unique lowercase letters encountered so far in the loop (which may or may not be incremented).
