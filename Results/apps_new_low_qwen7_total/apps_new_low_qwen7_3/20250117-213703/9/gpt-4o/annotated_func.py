#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` accepts three parameters `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`, each representing a suited tile as a string. It checks if the tiles form either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (a sequence of three consecutive tiles in the same suit).

- If all three tiles are identical (`t1 == t2 == t3`), the function returns `True`.
- If the tiles have the same suit (`s1 == s2 == s3`) and are in sequence (i.e., the numbers form a consecutive sequence from 1 to 7), the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The function does not modify any of its input parameters. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases within the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list of 3 string tiles, where each string represents a suited tile with a number (ranging from 1 to 9) followed by a suit character (m, p, or s). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions:
- If the list contains only one tile, it returns 2.
- If the list contains two tiles, it returns 1 if they are the same or if the difference between their values is less than or equal to 2. Otherwise, it returns 2.
- If the list contains three tiles, it returns 2 regardless of the values of the tiles.
