The `sort()` method sorts the list `tiles` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `tiles` is a list of 3 strings representing suited tiles with numbers ranging from 1 to 9 and suit characters (m, p, or s), after sorting, the list will be arranged in ascending order based on the numerical part of the strings.

Assuming the initial list is something like `['3p', '7s', '1m']`, after sorting, the list will become `['1m', '3p', '7s']`. However, since the exact initial values are not specified, we will denote them as generic strings that represent the suited tiles.

Output State: **`tiles` is a sorted list of 3 strings representing suited tiles with numbers ranging from 1 to 9 and suit characters (m, p, or s)**
