Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tiles` is a list of three strings, `t1` is the first string from `tiles`, `t2` is the second string from `tiles`, `t3` is the third string from `tiles`, the condition `(is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3))` is false, `min_additional_tiles` is 2, and `suits` is {'m': [int(t1[0]), int(t2[0]), int(t3[0])], 'p': [], 's': [int(x1), int(x2), int(x3)]}.
Code of the loop:
for suit, numbers in suits.items():
    min_additional_tiles = min(min_additional_tiles,
        tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers))


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: The code updates the value of `min_additional_tiles` to the minimum of its current value (`2`) and the result of `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)`. However, the exact value of `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `min_additional_tiles` depends on this unspecified function call.

Since the initial value of `min_additional_tiles` is `2`, the new value will be updated to `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` if this value is less than `2`. Otherwise, it remains `2`.

Output State: **`tiles` is a list of three strings, `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` are the first, second, and third strings from `tiles`, the condition `(is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3))` is false, `min_additional_tiles` is either `2` or `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` (whichever is smaller), `suits` is a dictionary with keys `'m'`, `'p'`, and `'s'` where `'m'` contains a list of at least one integer and `'s'` contains a list of at least one integer, and either `'m'` or `'s'` is non-empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `numbers` is the corresponding value in the `suits` dictionary, `min_additional_tiles` is the minimum of `2` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)`, `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` are the first, second, and third strings from `tiles`, the condition `(is_koutsu_or_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3))` is false, `suits` is a dictionary with keys `'m'`, `'p'`, and `'s'` where `'m'` contains a list of at least one integer and `'s'` contains a list of at least one integer, and either `'m'` or `'s'` is non-empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `numbers` is the corresponding value in the `suits` dictionary, `min_additional_tiles` is min(`min_tiles_initial`, `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)`)


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
