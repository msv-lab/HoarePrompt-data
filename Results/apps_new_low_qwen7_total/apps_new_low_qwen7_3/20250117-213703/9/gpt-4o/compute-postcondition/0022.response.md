Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of three strings `tiles`, where each string consists of a digit ranging from 1 to 9 and a lowercase letter 'm', 'p', or 's' indicating the suit. It checks if the tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu. If they do, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it processes the tiles to determine the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete groups for the specified suits ('m' and/or 's'). The function returns this minimum number of additional tiles.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- **Edge Case:** If the `tiles` list does not contain exactly three strings, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `split()` method will fail when applied to a non-string or a string with fewer than three elements.
- **Edge Case:** If the `tiles` list contains strings that do not match the expected format (i.e., a digit followed by a 'm', 'p', or 's'), the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to extract the integer part of the string.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function assumes that the `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` functions are defined elsewhere and behave as expected. If these functions are not defined or do not function as intended, the behavior of `func_1` could be incorrect. Specifically, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` should correctly identify whether the given tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu, and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` should accurately calculate the number of additional tiles required to complete a group for a given suit.
