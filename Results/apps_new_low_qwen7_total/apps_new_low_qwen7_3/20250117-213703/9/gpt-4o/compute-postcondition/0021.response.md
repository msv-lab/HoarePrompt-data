The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tiles`. `tiles` is a list of three strings, where each string consists of a digit ranging from 1 to 9 and a lowercase letter 'm', 'p', or 's' indicating the suit.

The function has two possible return cases:
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns `min_additional_tiles`, which is the minimum value obtained from calling `tiles_needed_to_complete_group(numbers)` for each suit in the `suits` dictionary, where `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'm' and/or 's', and at least one of 'm' or 's' is non-empty.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of three strings representing suited tiles and return either 0 or the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete groups for the specified suits.
