Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a list of three strings (`tiles`) and checks if the player can form a koutsu or shuntsu directly from these three tiles.
   - If a koutsu or shuntsu is found, it immediately returns 0, meaning no additional tiles are needed.
   - Otherwise, it processes the tiles to determine the minimum number of additional tiles required to complete either a koutsu or a shuntsu.
   - The logic within the function correctly identifies when a koutsu or shuntsu can be formed and calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed if neither is initially present.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**:
   - This function correctly checks for a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles in the same suit).
   - It handles both cases accurately, returning True if a koutsu or shuntsu is found and False otherwise.

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**:
   - This function correctly determines the minimum number of tiles needed to complete a group of three sequential tiles.
   - It handles different scenarios correctly:
     - Returns 2 if there is only one tile.
     - Returns 1 if there are two tiles and they can form part of a shuntsu.
     - Returns 1 if there are two tiles and the missing tile is exactly 1 or 2 away.
     - Returns 2 if none of the above conditions are met.

Given the logical correctness of all functions and their interactions, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of additional tiles needed.

Correctness: **True**
