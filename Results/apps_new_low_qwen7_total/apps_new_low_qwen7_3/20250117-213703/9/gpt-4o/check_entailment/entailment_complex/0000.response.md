Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function first splits the input into three tiles and checks if they form a koutsu or shuntsu using `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu()`.
   - If they do, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it categorizes the tiles by their suits and calculates the minimum additional tiles needed to complete either a koutsu or a shuntsu in each suit.

2. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether the given three tiles form a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive tiles in the same suit).

3. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of three tiles.
   - It handles different scenarios correctly:
     - If there is only one tile, it needs two more.
     - If there are two tiles and they are identical or form a sequence, it needs one more.
     - If there are two tiles and they don't fit the above conditions, it needs two more.
     - If there are three tiles, it always returns 2, which is the correct scenario for completing any group with infinite draws.

Given these functions, let's verify the correctness by considering the examples provided:

1. **Example 1: Input `1s 2s 3s`**
   - No need to draw any tiles since it forms a shuntsu.
   - `func_1` returns 0.

2. **Example 2: Input `9m 9m 9m`**
   - Already has a koutsu.
   - `func_1` returns 0.

3. **Example 3: Input `3p 9m 2p`**
   - No existing mentsu.
   - To form a shuntsu, need to draw one tile (e.g., `1p` or `4p`).
   - `func_1` returns 1.

All functions handle the logic correctly and provide the expected outputs for the given examples. Therefore, the overall implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
