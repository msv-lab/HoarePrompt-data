### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Logic Analysis**:
   - **`is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function correctly checks for both koutsu and shuntsu. However, there is a potential issue in the condition checking for shuntsu. The condition `sorted([n1, n2, n3]) in ([n1, n2, n3] for n1 in range(1, 8))` is incorrect because it does not account for all possible sequences. For instance, `[1, 2, 3]` is a valid shuntsu, but the current condition would fail for larger sequences like `[7, 8, 9]`.
   - **`tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function is flawed. The summary suggests it works correctly, but the actual implementation has issues. Specifically, the function always returns 2 when there are three tiles, regardless of their values, which is incorrect. For example, if the tiles are `[1, 2, 3]`, it should return 0, but it returns 2.

2. **`func_1` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` splits the input and uses `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` to check for immediate koutsu or shuntsu. If none are found, it calculates the minimum additional tiles needed for each suit separately using `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`. However, since `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` is flawed, the overall logic might produce incorrect results.

3. **Test Case Evaluation**:
   - **Example 1 (`1s 2s 3s`)**: This case correctly returns 0, as it already forms a shuntsu.
   - **Example 2 (`9m 9m 9m`)**: This case correctly returns 0, as it already forms a koutsu.
   - **Example 3 (`3p 9m 2p`)**: This case should return 1, as drawing one more tile (either 1p or 4p) completes a shuntsu. However, the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the minimum tiles needed, leading to a wrong result.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment did not thoroughly evaluate the flaws in the `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` function, which is a critical part of the solution. Since this function is fundamentally incorrect, the overall program logic will produce incorrect results in many cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` function, which leads to incorrect calculations in determining the minimum number of additional tiles needed.
