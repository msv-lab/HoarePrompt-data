Reasoning:
1. **Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`**: This function correctly checks if the three given tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu. It handles all necessary conditions and returns the correct boolean value. This function works well and does not introduce any logical errors.

2. **Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`**: This function calculates the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group (koutsu or shuntsu) based on the input list of three tiles. It handles different cases correctly:
   - If there's only one unique tile, it returns 2 because one more tile is needed to make a pair.
   - If there are two unique tiles, it checks if they form a pair or if the numbers are consecutive, returning 1 if true, otherwise 2.
   - If all three tiles are unique, it always returns 2 because even with three unique tiles, at least one more tile is needed to form a valid group.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function integrates the functionality of checking for existing mentsu and calculating the minimum number of additional tiles needed. It:
   - Checks if there is an existing koutsu or shuntsu using `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`.
   - If no mentsu exists, it sorts the tiles and uses `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` to find out how many more tiles are needed to form a valid group.

Given these functions, the program should work correctly for all test cases provided and handle edge cases appropriately. The logic in each function is sound and there are no apparent flaws in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
