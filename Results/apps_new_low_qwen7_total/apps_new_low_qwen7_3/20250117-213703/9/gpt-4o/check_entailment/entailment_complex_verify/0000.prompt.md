You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\ldots$, 9s.

In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.

Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?

Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. 

Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. 

Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.


-----Examples-----
Input
1s 2s 3s

Output
0

Input
9m 9m 9m

Output
0

Input
3p 9m 2p

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.

In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.

In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` accepts three parameters `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`, each representing a suited tile as a string. It checks if the tiles form either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (a sequence of three consecutive tiles in the same suit).

- If all three tiles are identical (`t1 == t2 == t3`), the function returns `True`.
- If the tiles have the same suit (`s1 == s2 == s3`) and are in sequence (i.e., the numbers form a consecutive sequence from 1 to 7), the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The function does not modify any of its input parameters. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described above. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases within the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` accepts a list of 3 string tiles, where each string represents a suited tile with a number (ranging from 1 to 9) followed by a suit character (m, p, or s). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions:
- If the list contains only one tile, it returns 2.
- If the list contains two tiles, it returns 1 if they are the same or if the difference between their values is less than or equal to 2. Otherwise, it returns 2.
- If the list contains three tiles, it returns 2 regardless of the values of the tiles.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly identifies whether the player can form a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) by checking all possible combinations of the tiles in their hand and calculating the minimum number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu. The functions `func_1`, `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`, and `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` handle the necessary logic:

- `func_1` checks if a koutsu or shuntsu exists directly in the input tiles. If yes, it returns 0.
- `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu` correctly identifies both koutsu and shuntsu patterns.
- `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to complete a group of the same number or a sequence.

The program handles all given examples and potential edge cases correctly, such as:
- Having all three tiles forming a koutsu or shuntsu (returns 0).
- Having exactly two tiles of the same number or sequence (returns 1).
- Not having any immediate koutsu or shuntsu but needing more than one additional tile (returns 2).

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all described cases and edge cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
