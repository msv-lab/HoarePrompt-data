### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its annotated version to ensure it correctly implements the logic for determining the minimum number of extra tiles needed to form a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu).

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initial Check for Mentsu**: The function starts by splitting the input into three tiles (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) and checking if they form a koutsu or shuntsu using `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`.
   - If a koutsu or shuntsu is found, it immediately returns 0, meaning no additional tiles are needed.
   
2. **Grouping Tiles by Suit**: If no mentsu is found, the function groups the tiles by suit and stores the numbers of each suit in lists.
   - This is done to check for potential koutsu or shuntsu within each suit.

3. **Calculating Minimum Additional Tiles**: The function iterates over each suit, calculates the number of additional tiles needed to complete a koutsu or shuntsu, and keeps track of the minimum required number.
   - The function uses `tiles_needed_to_complete_group` to determine the number of additional tiles needed for each suit.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the minimum number of additional tiles needed across all suits.

#### Function `is_koutsu_or_shuntsu`:
- This function checks if the three given tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu.
  - A koutsu is identified if all three tiles are identical.
  - A shuntsu is identified if the tiles are sequential and belong to the same suit.

#### Function `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`:
- This function determines the minimum number of additional tiles needed to complete a group of the same number or a sequence.
  - If the group has only one tile, it needs 2 more tiles.
  - If the group has two tiles, it needs 1 more tile if they are the same, or 1 more tile if they are part of a sequence.
  - If the group has more than two tiles, it always needs 2 more tiles.

#### Analysis:
- The code correctly handles the cases where a koutsu or shuntsu is directly present in the input tiles.
- It correctly groups the tiles by suit and checks for potential koutsu or shuntsu within each suit.
- The calculation of the minimum additional tiles needed is accurate and consistent with the logic defined in `tiles_needed_to_complete_group`.

Given the thorough implementation and validation through the annotated code, the program appears to meet all the requirements and correctly determine the minimum number of extra tiles needed.

### Conclusion:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of extra tiles needed to form a mentsu.
