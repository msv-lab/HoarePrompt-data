You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----

2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 * (a * 2 + b). If `total_length` ≤ n, then 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the console outputs `abs(2 * (a * 2 + b) // n)`.*



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to determine how many wooden bars are required to construct the frames for two doors, ensuring that each side of the frame is a solid piece from a wooden bar.

1. The total length required for the frames of two doors is calculated as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`, which accounts for two vertical sides (each of length `a`) and one horizontal side (of length `b`) for each door.
2. We then need to check how many wooden bars of length `n` are required to cover this total length. If the total length is less than or equal to `n`, only one wooden bar is needed.
3. Otherwise, we need to calculate the ceiling of the division of the total length by `n` to determine the minimum number of wooden bars required.

The given program attempts to do this calculation, but there is an issue with the way it handles the ceiling division. Specifically, the expression `-(-total_length // n)` is used to perform ceiling division, which is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

Here's the corrected version of the logic:
- Directly use `math.ceil(total_length / n)` to get the ceiling value of the division.

However, the provided solution uses a different approach that effectively calculates the ceiling division using `-(-total_length // n)`. This works due to the properties of integer division in Python, but it is not the most readable or maintainable way to write this code.

Let's verify the correctness of the original program step-by-step:

1. The input values are read correctly.
2. The total length required is calculated as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`.
3. The number of wooden bars is determined by `1` if the total length is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise by `-(-total_length // n)`.

Given the problem constraints and the approach taken, the program appears to be logically correct, although the method used for ceiling division might be simplified for clarity.

Correctness: **True**
