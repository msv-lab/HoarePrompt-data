Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`) from the standard input within their specified ranges.
2. **Total Length Calculation**: The total length required to construct the frames for two doors is correctly calculated as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. This accounts for the two vertical sides (each of length `a`) and one horizontal top side (of length `b`) for both doors.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the scenario where the total length required (`total_length`) is less than or equal to `n`. In this case, only one wooden bar is sufficient, and `1` is printed.
4. **Ceiling Division**: For cases where `total_length` exceeds `n`, the program uses the expression `-(-total_length // n)` to calculate the ceiling value of `total_length / n`. This is mathematically equivalent to the ceiling division and ensures that the output is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `total_length / n`.

Given the correct handling of all constraints and edge cases, the annotated program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
