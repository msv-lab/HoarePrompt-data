Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of wooden bars of length `n` needed to construct the frames for two doors.
2. The total length required for the frames is calculated as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`, which simplifies to `4 * a + 2 * b`.
3. The program checks if this total length is less than or equal to `n`. If so, it prints `1`, indicating that only one wooden bar is needed.
4. If the total length exceeds `n`, the program uses the expression `-(-total_length // n)` to compute the ceiling value of `total_length / n`. This correctly calculates the minimum number of wooden bars needed when the total length exceeds the length of a single wooden bar.
5. The logic in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem and correctly handles both cases: when the total length fits within a single bar and when it does not.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
