Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of wooden bars needed for the frames. Specifically, the logic used to determine if one wooden bar is sufficient or not is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input
8
4
2

Output
1
```

According to the problem description, for the given input, we need to calculate the total length required for two frames. Each frame requires:
- 2 vertical sides of length 4, totaling \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 top side of length 2, totaling \(1 \times 2 = 2\)

So, the total length required for two frames is \(8 + 2 = 10\). Since each wooden bar is of length 8, we need at least two wooden bars to cover this length (as 1 wooden bar of length 8 is insufficient).

However, the program incorrectly prints 1 for this input, indicating it believes one wooden bar is enough, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the total length required and then determine the minimum number of wooden bars needed based on the total length. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (2 * a + b)
    required_bars = -(-total_length // n)
    print(required_bars)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the total length required for the frames is accurately calculated and the minimum number of wooden bars is determined correctly.
