### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the given program step-by-step.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - The total length required for the frames of two doors is calculated as \( 2 \times (a \times 2 + b) \). This formula correctly accounts for the two vertical sides (each of length \( a \)) and one horizontal side (of length \( b \)) for each door.

3. **Ceiling Division**:
   - The program checks if the total length is less than or equal to \( n \).
   - If \( 2 \times (a \times 2 + b) \leq n \), it prints `1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints \(-(-\text{total\_length} // n)\). This expression is equivalent to \(\lceil \frac{\text{total\_length}}{n} \rceil\) due to the properties of integer division in Python. The expression \(-(-x // y)\) is a known way to compute the ceiling of \( x / y \) in Python.

Given the problem constraints and the approach taken, let's validate the logic:

- The total length required is indeed \( 2 \times (a \times 2 + b) \).
- The ceiling division \(\lceil \frac{2 \times (a \times 2 + b)}{n} \rceil\) is correctly handled by the expression \(-(-\text{total\_length} // n)\).

The original assessment correctly identifies the logical correctness of the program. However, it mentions that the expression \(-(-\text{total\_length} // n)\) is not the most readable or maintainable way to perform ceiling division. Instead, using `math.ceil(total_length / n)` would be more clear and standard practice.

Despite this stylistic concern, the logic itself is sound and the program produces the correct output based on the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem. The minor stylistic issue mentioned in the original assessment does not affect the correctness of the solution.

**Final:** True
