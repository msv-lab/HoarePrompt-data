### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary step by step.

#### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func():
       n = int(input())
       a = int(input())
       b = int(input())
       total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
       if total_length <= n:
           print(1)
       else:
           print(-(-total_length // n))
   ```

2. **Function Summary Recap:**
   - The function calculates the total length required for the frames as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`.
   - If the total length is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the ceiling value of `total_length / n`, which is calculated using the expression `-(-total_length // n)`.

3. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The initial assessment stated that the program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of wooden bars needed for the frames. Specifically, the logic used to determine if one wooden bar is sufficient or not is flawed.

4. **Example Evaluation:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     Input
     8
     4
     2
     ```
   - According to the problem description, each frame requires:
     - 2 vertical sides of length 4, totaling \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
     - 1 top side of length 2, totaling \(1 \times 2 = 2\)
   - So, the total length required for two frames is \(8 + 2 = 10\).
   - Since each wooden bar is of length 8, we need at least two wooden bars to cover this length.
   - However, the program incorrectly prints `1`, indicating it believes one wooden bar is enough.

5. **Revised Program:**
   - The suggested correction in the original assessment is:
     ```python
     def func():
         n = int(input())
         a = int(input())
         b = int(input())
         total_length = 2 * (2 * a + b)
         required_bars = -(-total_length // n)
         print(required_bars)
     ```

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Let's verify the corrected version with the same example:
     - For the input:
       ```
       8
       4
       2
       ```
     - Total length required: \(2 \times (2 \times 4 + 2) = 2 \times (8 + 2) = 2 \times 10 = 20\)
     - Required bars: \(-(-20 // 8) = -(-2.5) = 3\)
     - The output is `3`, which is correct.

7. **General Case:**
   - For any valid input, the corrected version ensures that the total length is accurately calculated and the minimum number of wooden bars is determined correctly.

Given that the revised program now correctly calculates the minimal number of wooden bars needed for the frames, the initial assessment was accurate in pointing out the flaw in the original program but the proposed correction addresses and fixes the issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after the suggested corrections, is now correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
