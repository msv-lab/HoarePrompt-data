You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.


-----Output-----

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1
2

Output
1

Input
5
3
4

Output
6

Input
6
4
2

Output
4

Input
20
5
6

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example one wooden bar is enough, since the total length of all six sides of the frames for two doors is 8.

In the second example 6 wooden bars is enough, because for each side of the frames the new wooden bar is needed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if total_length <= n:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-(-total_length // n))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive. It calculates the total length as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. If the total length is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling value of `total_length / n`, which is calculated using the expression `-(-total_length // n)`. The function ensures that all input constraints are respected and handles the case where `total_length` exceeds `n` by providing the smallest integer greater than or equal to `total_length / n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of wooden bars needed for the frames. Specifically, the logic used to determine if one wooden bar is sufficient or not is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input
8
4
2

Output
1
```

According to the problem description, for the given input, we need to calculate the total length required for two frames. Each frame requires:
- 2 vertical sides of length 4, totaling \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 top side of length 2, totaling \(1 \times 2 = 2\)

So, the total length required for two frames is \(8 + 2 = 10\). Since each wooden bar is of length 8, we need at least two wooden bars to cover this length (as 1 wooden bar of length 8 is insufficient).

However, the program incorrectly prints 1 for this input, indicating it believes one wooden bar is enough, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should correctly calculate the total length required and then determine the minimum number of wooden bars needed based on the total length. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    total_length = 2 * (2 * a + b)
    required_bars = -(-total_length // n)
    print(required_bars)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the total length required for the frames is accurately calculated and the minimum number of wooden bars is determined correctly.
