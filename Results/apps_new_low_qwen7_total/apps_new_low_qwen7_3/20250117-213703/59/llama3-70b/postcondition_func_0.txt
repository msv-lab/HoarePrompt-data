The function accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive. It calculates the total length as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. If the total length is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling value of `total_length / n`, which is calculated using the expression `-(-total_length // n)`. The function ensures that all input constraints are respected and handles the case where `total_length` exceeds `n` by providing the smallest integer greater than or equal to `total_length / n`.
