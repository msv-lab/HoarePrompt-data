The code `print(-(-total_length // n))` performs the following operations:

1. `total_length // n` performs integer division of `total_length` by `n`.
2. `-(-total_length // n)` applies the negation twice, which results in the absolute value of the integer division.

Given the initial state:
- `total_length` is `2 * (a * 2 + b)`, and
- `total_length` is greater than `n`.

Let's calculate the value of the expression:

1. Calculate `total_length`: `total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)`.
2. Perform the integer division: `total_length // n`.
3. Apply the negation twice: `abs(total_length // n)`.

Since `total_length > n`, the result of `total_length // n` will be a positive integer (let's call this integer `k`). Therefore, `-(-k)` is simply `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 * (a * 2 + b), and the output is `abs(2 * (a * 2 + b) // n)`**.
