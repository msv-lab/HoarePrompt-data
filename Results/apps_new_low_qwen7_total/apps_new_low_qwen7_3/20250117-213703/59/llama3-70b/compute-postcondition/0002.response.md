The code `print(1)` prints the number 1 to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `total_length`. The only change is that the number 1 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 * (a * 2 + b), and the current value of `total_length` satisfies total_length ≤ n; 1 is printed to the console.**
