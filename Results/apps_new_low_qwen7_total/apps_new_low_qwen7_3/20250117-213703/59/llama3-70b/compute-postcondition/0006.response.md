The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints are that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. However, since the function definition itself does not appear to use these parameters directly in the provided code snippet, and the output description does not specify a clear return value or behavior, we need to infer based on typical function behavior.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific logic in the function body, the function could be designed to perform some operation on these parameters, but without more detail, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.**
