Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, total_length is 2 * (a * 2 + b)**

Explanation:
1. The first line takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`.
2. The second line takes an integer input and assigns it to `a`.
3. The third line takes another integer input and assigns it to `b`.
4. The fourth line calculates `total_length` as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`, which simplifies to `2 * (2a + b)` or `4a + 2b`.

After executing all the lines, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their input values, while `total_length` is calculated based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
