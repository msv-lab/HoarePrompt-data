#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

total_length = 2 * (a * 2 + b)
    if (total_length <= n) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-(-total_length // n))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, `total_length` is 2 * (a * 2 + b). If `total_length` ≤ n, then 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the console outputs `abs(2 * (a * 2 + b) // n)`.*
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive. It calculates the total length as `2 * (a * 2 + b)`. If the total length is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling value of `total_length / n`, which is calculated using the expression `-(-total_length // n)`. The function ensures that all input constraints are respected and handles the case where `total_length` exceeds `n` by providing the smallest integer greater than or equal to `total_length / n`.
