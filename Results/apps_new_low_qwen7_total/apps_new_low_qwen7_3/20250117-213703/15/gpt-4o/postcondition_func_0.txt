The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`. It checks if a specific condition is met within the list `p` and a stack-based operation. If the condition is met, it returns an empty list `result`; otherwise, it returns -1. The function processes the list `p` by maintaining a stack to ensure elements are in non-decreasing order. If any element in `p` is less than the maximum seen so far (`max_seen`), the function immediately returns -1. After processing, the function includes remaining numbers not in `p` in a non-decreasing order and ensures the final stack is empty before returning `result`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If any element in `p` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1.
- If no elements in `p` meet the condition and the remaining numbers can be arranged in non-decreasing order without violating the stack-based condition, the function returns an empty list `result`.

Missing functionality in the annotations:
- The annotations mention `total` as 0, which is never used in the code and can be omitted.
- The annotations suggest `num` being undefined after the final for loop, but the code sets `num` to the last element of `remaining_numbers` before the loop.

The final state of the program after it concludes is:
- If the function returns -1, the program ends with no output.
- If the function returns an empty list `result`, the program outputs an empty list after ensuring all elements in `p` maintain a non-decreasing order and including all remaining numbers in a non-decreasing order without violating the stack-based condition.
