You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).

You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:

  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty);  Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 

You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.

If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.

For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:

  Remove 3 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 2 from a and push it into s;  Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 

After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.

You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.

Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.

If there exists no answer then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ k < n) — the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.

The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to restore a stack-sortable permutation p of size n such that the first k elements of p are equal to elements given in the input, print lexicographically maximal such permutation.

Otherwise print -1.

result = func_1(n, k, p)
if result == -1:
    print(result)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k, p):
    stack = []
    max_seen = 0
    for num in p:
        if num < max_seen:
            return -1
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            max_seen = stack.pop()
        stack.append(num)
    remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)
    remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)
    result = p[:]
    for num in remaining_numbers:
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            result.append(stack.pop())
        stack.append(num)
    result.extend(reversed(stack))
    stack = []
    max_seen = 0
    for num in result:
        if num < max_seen:
            return -1
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            max_seen = stack.pop()
        stack.append(num)
    return result


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
