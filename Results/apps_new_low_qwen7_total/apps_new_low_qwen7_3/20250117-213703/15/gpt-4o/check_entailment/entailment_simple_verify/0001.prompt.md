You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).

You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:

  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty);  Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 

You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.

If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.

For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:

  Remove 3 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from a and push it into s;  Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 2 from a and push it into s;  Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b;  Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 

After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.

You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.

Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.

If there exists no answer then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ k < n) — the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.

The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to restore a stack-sortable permutation p of size n such that the first k elements of p are equal to elements given in the input, print lexicographically maximal such permutation.

Otherwise print -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the solution and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and separates it into `n`, `k`, and the initial segment `p` of the permutation.
   - It initializes an empty stack and keeps track of the maximum value seen so far (`max_seen`).

2. **Checking Initial Segment:**
   - For each number in `p`, it checks if the number is less than `max_seen`. If it is, the permutation cannot be stack-sortable, and it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it uses a stack to simulate the first part of the process where numbers are pushed onto the stack and popped off in a way that would eventually make the permutation stack-sortable.
   - This part ensures that the initial segment respects the conditions necessary for stack-sortability.

3. **Generating Remaining Numbers:**
   - After processing the initial segment, it calculates the remaining numbers needed to complete the permutation. These numbers are generated in descending order and stored in `remaining_numbers`.

4. **Appending Remaining Numbers:**
   - It appends these remaining numbers to the result, ensuring that the stack remains consistent with the stack-sortable property.

5. **Final Validation:**
   - After appending all the numbers, it performs one final check to ensure that the resulting permutation is stack-sortable. If any number is less than `max_seen`, it returns `-1`.

6. **Output:**
   - If the permutation passes all checks, it prints the result.

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles the initial segment validation and ensures that the remaining numbers are added in a way that maintains stack-sortability.
- The use of `max_seen` and the stack ensures that the permutation can be built in a manner that respects the constraints.
- The final validation step ensures that the entire permutation is stack-sortable.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it accurately implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the given initial segment can be extended to form a stack-sortable permutation and generates the lexicographically maximal such permutation if possible.
