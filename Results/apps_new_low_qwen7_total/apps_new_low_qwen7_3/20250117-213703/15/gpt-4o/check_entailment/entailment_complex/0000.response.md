Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to construct a stack-sortable permutation of size `n` using the first `k` elements of `p` and the remaining elements from the set of numbers `{1, 2, ..., n}`.
   - It ensures that the constructed permutation is stack-sortable by maintaining a stack and checking conditions related to the order of elements.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the initial segment `p` is not stack-sortable by returning `-1`.

2. **Stack Management**:
   - The function uses a stack to manage the sequence of operations required to make the permutation stack-sortable.
   - It iterates through the initial segment `p` and maintains a `max_seen` variable to track the largest element encountered so far.
   - If an element in `p` is less than `max_seen`, it returns `-1` because such a configuration cannot be part of a stack-sortable permutation.
   - It then adds the remaining numbers (not in `p`) in descending order to the result, ensuring they do not violate the stack-sortable property.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly identifies invalid configurations early (e.g., when an element in `p` is less than `max_seen`).
   - It ensures that the remaining elements are added in a non-decreasing order, which is crucial for maintaining the stack-sortable property.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - After constructing the result, the function performs a final validation to ensure that the entire permutation is stack-sortable.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
