Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads input and splits it into components. This part is handled correctly.
   - It initializes the necessary variables like `stack`, `max_seen`, and processes the given prefix `p`.

2. **Validation and Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the given prefix `p` can be extended to a stack-sortable permutation.
   - It uses a stack to ensure that elements are processed in a way that maintains non-decreasing order.
   - If any element in `p` is found to be less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1, which is correct.
   - The function then includes the remaining numbers in a non-decreasing order and ensures the final stack is empty.

3. **Handling Remaining Numbers**:
   - The function identifies the remaining numbers that need to be placed in `p` and sorts them in descending order to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - It then appends these numbers to the result list `result` in a way that respects the stack-based condition.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - Before returning the result, the function performs a final check to ensure the entire `result` list maintains the stack-sortable property.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the prefix `p` cannot be extended to a stack-sortable permutation by returning -1.
   - It also ensures that the remaining numbers are included in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the permutation.

6. **Output**:
   - If the function returns a valid permutation, the program prints it.
   - If the function returns -1, the program prints -1 as required.

Given the detailed implementation and the validation steps, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
