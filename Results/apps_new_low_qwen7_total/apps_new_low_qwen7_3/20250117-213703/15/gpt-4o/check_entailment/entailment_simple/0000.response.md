Reasoning:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The problem requires us to determine if the given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically maximal stack-sortable permutation for the remaining elements. We need to check if the logic handles all edge cases and produces the correct output as per the problem statement.

2. **Key Components of the Logic**:
   - The initial part of the function `func_1` checks if the given prefix `p` is already stack-sortable using a stack and `max_seen`.
   - After ensuring the prefix is stack-sortable, it computes the remaining numbers needed to form a stack-sortable permutation.
   - It then constructs the full permutation by appending the necessary numbers in a way that maintains the stack-sortable property.

3. **Checking the Code**:
   - The initial check with the stack and `max_seen` ensures that the prefix `p` is stack-sortable.
   - The `remaining_numbers` set calculation is correct, as it correctly identifies the numbers needed to complete the permutation.
   - The construction of the full permutation by appending the `remaining_numbers` in reverse order and ensuring the stack remains valid is done correctly.
   - The final check with the stack ensures the resulting permutation is indeed stack-sortable.

4. **Edge Cases and Special Considerations**:
   - The code handles the case where no valid permutation can be formed by returning `-1`.
   - The lexicographically maximal property is ensured by sorting the `remaining_numbers` in descending order before processing them.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to follow the logic correctly and handles all required conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
