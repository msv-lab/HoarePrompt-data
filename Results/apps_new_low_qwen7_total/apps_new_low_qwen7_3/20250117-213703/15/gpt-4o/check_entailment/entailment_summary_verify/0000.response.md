### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Initial Checks and Stack Processing

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables**:
   - The program reads the input and separates `n`, `k`, and the initial `k` elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It initializes an empty stack and a variable `max_seen` to keep track of the maximum element seen so far.

2. **Processing Given Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the given elements `p`. For each element, it checks if it is less than `max_seen`. If so, it returns `-1` because the permutation cannot be stack-sortable.
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, it pops elements from the stack that are less than the current element, updates `max_seen` accordingly, and pushes the current element onto the stack.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing the given elements, the program identifies the remaining elements that need to be added to the permutation.
   - These remaining elements are sorted in descending order to maximize the lexicographical value of the final permutation.
   - The program then appends these elements to the result list and ensures that the stack condition is maintained by popping elements that are less than the current element.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - The program performs a final check to ensure that the entire permutation is stack-sortable by pushing all elements onto a temporary stack and verifying the order.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where the given `p` is already a valid stack-sortable permutation. In such cases, the program should return the permutation directly without modifying it.
   - The function should also handle cases where the remaining elements cannot be appended in a way that maintains the stack-sortability condition.

2. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach taken by the program seems logically sound. However, let's verify if there are any edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail.

#### Edge Cases

1. **Valid Permutation Already Provided**:
   - If the given `p` is already a valid stack-sortable permutation, the program should return it directly without modification. This is handled correctly.

2. **No Valid Permutation Can Be Formed**:
   - If the given `p` is not a valid stack-sortable permutation and no valid permutation can be formed by appending the remaining elements, the program should return `-1`. This is also handled correctly.

3. **Lexicographically Maximal Permutation**:
   - The program ensures that the remaining elements are appended in descending order to maximize the lexicographical value of the final permutation. This is handled correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to restore a stack-sortable permutation based on the given constraints. There are no apparent scenarios where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the provided logic.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary provided.
