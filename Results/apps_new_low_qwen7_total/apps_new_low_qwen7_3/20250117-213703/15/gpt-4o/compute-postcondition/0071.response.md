The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops an element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Since `stack` contains at least one element, `max_seen` will be assigned the value of that element. The other variables (`num` and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` contains at least one element less than before, `max_seen` is equal to the popped element from `stack`, `num` is undefined, `result` is an empty list**
