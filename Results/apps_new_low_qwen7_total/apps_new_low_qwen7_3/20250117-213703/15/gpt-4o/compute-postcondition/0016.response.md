Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\).
   - `num` is the second element of the list `p`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `stack` is now `[num]`.
   - `max_seen` is 0.
   - If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1; otherwise, the function continues execution with the current state.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` must be true.
   - Since `stack` is initialized to `[num]`, the condition simplifies to `stack[-1] < num`.

4. **Checking the Current Values**:
   - `stack[-1]` is `num`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `num < num`, which is false.

5. **Modifying the State**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need to change the value of `num` such that `num < stack[-1]` is true.
   - Since `stack[-1]` is `num`, we need to ensure that `num` is less than some value in `stack` that is not `num` itself.

Given the constraints and the fact that `stack` starts with `[num]`, we need to modify `num` to be less than some value in `stack` that is not `num`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only way to satisfy the condition `stack and stack[-1] < num` is to ensure that `num` is less than some value in `stack` that is not `num` itself.
   - However, since `stack` is currently `[num]`, we cannot satisfy this condition without changing the initial state of `num`.

Since the problem specifies that the function should continue execution with the current state if `num` is less than `max_seen`, and `max_seen` is initially 0, the only way to make the loop execute is to ensure that `num` is less than some value in `stack` that is not `num` itself.

Therefore, the correct state modification is:

State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the second element of the list `p` and must be less than some value in `stack` that is not `num` itself, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is now `[num]`, `max_seen` is 0.**
