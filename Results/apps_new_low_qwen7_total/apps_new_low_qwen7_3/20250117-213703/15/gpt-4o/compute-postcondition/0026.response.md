Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, and `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited. If `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns `None`).***
