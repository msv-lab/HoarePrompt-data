The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Initially, `stack` is `[5, 5]`, so after popping the last element, `stack` will be `[5]` and `max_seen` will be `5`.

Output State: **`stack` is [5], `max_seen` is 5, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5, 5]**
