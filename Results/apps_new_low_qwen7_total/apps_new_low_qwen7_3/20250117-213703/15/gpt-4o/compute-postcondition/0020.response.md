Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers
   - `num` is the second element of the list `p`
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\)
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
   - `stack` is not empty (top element is `max_seen`)
   - `max_seen` is the second element of the list `p`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves `stack` and `stack[-1]` being compared to `num`.
   - `stack` is not empty, and its top element (`stack[-1]`) is `max_seen`.
   - For the loop to continue, `max_seen` must be less than `num`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `max_seen` is the second element of the list `p`, and `num` is also the second element of the list `p`, the values of `max_seen` and `num` should be the same.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_seen` must be less than `num`.

Given this, we need to ensure that the top element of the stack (`max_seen`) is less than `num`.

**Final State**:
- `total` is 0
- `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers
- `num` is the second element of the list `p`
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
- `stack` is not empty (top element is `max_seen` and `max_seen` must be less than `num`)

**State**: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is not empty (with the top element being `max_seen` and `max_seen` must be less than `num`)**
