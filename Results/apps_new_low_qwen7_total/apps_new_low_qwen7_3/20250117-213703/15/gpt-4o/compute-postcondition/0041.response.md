`result` appends the last element of `stack` and then `stack` pops that element. Since the last element of `stack` is less than `num`, the value of `result` is updated with that element, and `stack` loses that element. The initial state of `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `stack` does not contain the last element which was less than `num`, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack`.**
