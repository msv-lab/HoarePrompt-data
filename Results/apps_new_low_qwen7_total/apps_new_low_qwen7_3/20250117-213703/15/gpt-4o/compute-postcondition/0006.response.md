`max_seen` is assigned the value popped from `stack`. Since `stack` contains at least one element less than `num`, let's denote the popped value as `stack_top`. After popping, `max_seen` will be `stack_top`. The value of `stack` will be updated to remove `stack_top`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` does not contain `stack_top`, `max_seen` is `stack_top`, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**.
