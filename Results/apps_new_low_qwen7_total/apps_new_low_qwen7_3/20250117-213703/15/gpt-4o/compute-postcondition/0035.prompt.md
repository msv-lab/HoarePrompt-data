Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, p is a list of k integers where each integer is a unique value between 1 and n, stack is an empty list, max_seen is 0
Code of the loop:
for num in p:
    if num < max_seen:
        return -1
    while stack and stack[-1] < num:
        max_seen = stack.pop()
    stack.append(num)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is now `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was popped from the stack, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is a list containing `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `p` is a list of k unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
