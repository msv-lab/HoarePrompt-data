`stack` appends the value of `num` to itself. Since `num` is the last value of `num` used in the loop, the updated `stack` will have the new value appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `stack` is empty plus the new value of `num`, `max_seen` is the last element of the original `stack`, `num` is the last value of `num` used in the loop, and `result` is a list of elements that were popped from the stack.**
