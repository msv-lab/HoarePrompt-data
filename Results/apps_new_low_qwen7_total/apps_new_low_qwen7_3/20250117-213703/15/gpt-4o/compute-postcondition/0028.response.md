`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack` is a list containing `[num1, num2]` and `stack[-1]` must be less than `num`, the last element `stack[-1]` (which is `num2`) is popped from the stack and assigned to `max_seen`. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and the state of `total` and the list `p` is also unaffected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is a list containing `[num1]`, `max_seen` is `num2` and is less than `num`.**
