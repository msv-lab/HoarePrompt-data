The code `result.append(stack.pop())` impacts the following:
- `stack.pop()` removes the last element from `stack` and returns it.
- This returned value is then appended to `result`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element (though it's not directly affected).
- `stack` must not be empty and its last element must be less than `num`.
- `result` contains the last element of the original `stack`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `stack` is removed and appended to `result`.
- The last element of `stack` before the operation was less than `num`, so it is still less than `num` in `result`.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element, `stack` is `stack` without its last element and its last element was less than `num`, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` appended to itself**
