The `max_seen` variable is assigned the value of the top element of the `stack`, which is popped off the stack. The value of `max_seen` before this operation was the second element of the list `p`. After popping, the top of the stack no longer holds this value, but `max_seen` now holds it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is not empty (with the top element being previously `num` now `max_seen`), `max_seen` is the second element of the list `p`.**
