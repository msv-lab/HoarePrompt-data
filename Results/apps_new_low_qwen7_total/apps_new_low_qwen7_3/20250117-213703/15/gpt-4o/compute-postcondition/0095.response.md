The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Initially, `stack` is `[5]`. Popping the last element from `[5]` results in `max_seen` being assigned the value `5`, and the `stack` becomes an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **`stack` is [], `max_seen` is 5, `num` must be greater than 5, and `result` is [5, 5]**
