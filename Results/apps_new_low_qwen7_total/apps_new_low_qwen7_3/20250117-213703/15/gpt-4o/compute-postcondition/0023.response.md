The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` (which is the second element of the list `p`) to the stack. The stack was initially empty, so after appending `num`, the stack now contains `num`. The value of `num` is taken from the second element of the list `p`, and the other variables (`total`, `n`, `k`, `max_seen`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is a list containing `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.**
