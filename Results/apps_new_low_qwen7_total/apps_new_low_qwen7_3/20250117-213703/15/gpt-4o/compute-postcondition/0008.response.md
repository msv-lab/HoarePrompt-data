`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. This means `max_seen` is now the last element of the `stack` before it was popped. The state of the `stack` changes as the last element is removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` does not contain `stack_top` (and the last element of `stack` is no longer in the stack), `max_seen` is the value of the last element of `stack` before the pop operation, `stack[-1]` was less than `num` and is no longer in the stack.**
