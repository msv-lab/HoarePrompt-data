The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Given the initial state, the last element of `stack` must be less than 5, and this value is now stored in `max_seen`. The `stack` itself will no longer contain this last element. The other variables (`num` and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` does not contain its last element which was less than 5, `max_seen` is the last element popped from `stack`, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5]**
