To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
```
This means the loop continues as long as the `stack` is not empty and the last element of the `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

### Given State
- `total` is 0
- `stack` does not contain the last element which was less than `num`
- `result` contains the last element of the original `stack`

### Analysis
1. **Stack and Last Element Condition**: The loop will continue if `stack` is not empty and the last element of the `stack` is less than `num`. Since the given state mentions that `stack` does not contain the last element which was less than `num`, this implies two possible scenarios:
   - The `stack` is empty.
   - The `stack` is not empty but the last element of the `stack` is not less than `num`.

2. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - If `stack` is empty, the loop condition fails immediately, so we need to ensure `stack` is not empty.
   - If `stack` is not empty but the last element is not less than `num`, we need to ensure the last element of the `stack` is less than `num`.

Given the above analysis, the state of `stack` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again. Specifically, we need to ensure that `stack` is not empty and the last element of the `stack` is less than `num`.

### Adjusted State
- `total` remains 0
- `stack` must be non-empty and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`

Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total` is 0, `stack` must be non-empty and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`**
