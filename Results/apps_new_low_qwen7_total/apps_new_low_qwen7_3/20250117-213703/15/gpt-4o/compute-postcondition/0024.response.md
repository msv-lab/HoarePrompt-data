Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `p` using the variable `num`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `p`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `total` is 0.
   - `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers.
   - `num` is the second element of the list `p` (which means `num` was set to the second element during the previous iteration).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `stack` is a list containing `[num]`.
   - `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `num` is the second element of the list `p` and we are now moving to the next iteration, `num` will be set to the third element of the list `p`.
   - The list `p` remains the same as it is a reference to the original list.
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified within the loop.
   - `stack` will now contain the new `num` added to it.
   - `max_seen` will remain the same unless the new `num` in the stack exceeds the current `max_seen`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `total` remains 0.
- `p` remains the same.
- `num` will be the third element of the list `p`.
- `stack` will contain the first two elements `[num1, num2]` where `num1` and `num2` are the first two elements of `p`.
- `max_seen` remains the same unless the new `num` exceeds `max_seen`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.**

(Note: `num1` and `num2` represent the first two elements of the list `p` from the previous iteration.)
