Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

2. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty (`stack` is truthy) and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.
   
3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element.

4. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop must be satisfied:
     1. `stack` must not be empty.
     2. The last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The current state only mentions `remaining_numbers` having at least one more element. This does not directly influence the loop's condition involving `stack`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to guarantee that `stack` is not empty and that the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

Given the current state and the loop condition, the following adjustments are necessary:
- Ensure `stack` is not empty.
- Ensure the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

Therefore, the final state right before the loop should be:

State: **`remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element, `stack` must not be empty, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`**
