The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Initially, `stack` is `[5]`, so after popping, `stack` becomes an empty list `[]`. The value of `max_seen` is set to the popped value, which is `5`.

Output State: **`stack` is [], `max_seen` is 5, `num` must be greater than 5, and `result` is [5, 5]**
