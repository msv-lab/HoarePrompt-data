`stack` is an empty list, and `num` is the third element of the list `p`. The code appends `num` to the `stack`. After appending, the `stack` will contain `num`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of k unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was on the stack before the loop exited.**
