Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial States
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `p` is a list of \(k\) integers where each integer is a unique value between 1 and \(n\).
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `max_seen` is 0.

### For Loop
The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization Check**: The list `p` contains \(k\) unique integers from 1 to \(n\). This ensures that there are valid elements to iterate over.
2. **First Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the list `p` must contain at least one element.
3. **State in Loop Head**: At the start of the first iteration, the variable `num` will be the first element of the list `p`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- The list `p` is not empty (since it has \(k\) unique integers).
- The first element of `p` is assigned to `num`.

### Final State for First Execution
- The list `p` must have at least one element, i.e., \(k \geq 1\).
- The first element of the list `p` is assigned to `num`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `stack`, `max_seen`) remain as their initial states since they do not affect the first iteration condition directly.

### Final Answer
State: **`p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is an empty list, `max_seen` is 0**.
