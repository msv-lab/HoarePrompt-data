The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `p`. Here, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000 and 1 ≤ k < n, and `p` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is a unique value between 1 and `n`. Based on the output cases provided, the function returns -1 in all cases except one, where it returns an empty list 'result'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `p`, and if any condition results in a specific scenario leading to the return of an empty list, it does so; otherwise, it returns -1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `p`. If a specific condition is met, it returns an empty list 'result'; otherwise, it returns -1.**
