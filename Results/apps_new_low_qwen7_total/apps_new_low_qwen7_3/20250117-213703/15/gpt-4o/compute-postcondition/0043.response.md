The code `result.append(stack.pop())` pops the last element from `stack` and appends it to `result`. Since `stack` is non-empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`, after popping the last element from `stack`, the new last element in `stack` (if any) will still be less than `num`.

- The `total` variable remains unchanged and is still 0.
- The `stack` loses its last element, which was less than `num`.
- The `result` list gains the last element from `stack`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `stack` is now a non-empty list with its last element being less than `num` (but not the element just popped), `result` contains the popped element.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `stack` is a non-empty list with its last element being less than `num`, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack`**
