`result` appends the last element of `stack` to itself, and then `stack` pops its last element. The last element of `stack` before the operation is less than `num`. After the operation, this element is now the last element in `result`. The remaining elements in `stack` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element; `stack` is `stack` without its last element which was less than `num`; `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` appended to itself and the last element of `stack` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element, `stack` is `stack` without its last element which was less than `num`, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` appended to itself**
