The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `remaining_numbers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `remaining_numbers`. For the loop to execute again, `remaining_numbers` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `stack` is either empty or contains elements all greater than or equal to `num` plus the value of `num`.
- `result` contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop execution.
- `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_numbers` must have at least one element left. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `remaining_numbers` has at least one element.

State: **`stack` is either empty or contains elements all greater than or equal to `num` plus the value of `num`, `result` contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop execution, `remaining_numbers` must have at least one element.**
