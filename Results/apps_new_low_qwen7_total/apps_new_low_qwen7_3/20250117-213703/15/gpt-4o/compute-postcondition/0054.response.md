The code snippet `stack.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state where `stack` is either empty or contains elements all greater than or equal to `num` (from the previous loop behavior), and `result` contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop execution, `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.

After executing this line of code:
- `stack` will have the value of `num` added to it.
- `result` remains unchanged because no popping or appending to `result` occurs in this line.
- `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged as it was not modified in this operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `stack` now contains all its previous elements plus `num`.
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` is either empty or contains elements all greater than or equal to `num` plus the value of `num`, `result` contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop execution, `remaining_numbers` remains unchanged.**
