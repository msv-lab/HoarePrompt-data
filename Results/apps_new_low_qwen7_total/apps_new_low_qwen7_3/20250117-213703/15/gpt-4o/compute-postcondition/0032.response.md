`max_seen` is assigned the value of `stack.pop()`. Since `stack` contains an element that is less than `num`, `max_seen` will take the value of that element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` contains an element less than `num`, `max_seen` is the element popped from `stack`**
