The code snippet `max_seen = stack.pop()` impacts the following variables:
- `max_seen` is assigned the value of the top element of the stack (`stack[-1]`), which is popped from the stack.
- The stack loses its top element.

Given the initial conditions:
- `total` is 0
- `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers
- `num` is the second element of the list `p`
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\)
- `stack` is not empty (top element is `max_seen` and `max_seen` must be less than `num`)

After executing `max_seen = stack.pop()`, the top element of the stack is removed, and `max_seen` is updated to this value. The output state will reflect these changes.

**Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is not empty (without its top element, which is now stored in `max_seen` and `max_seen` must be less than `num`).**
