Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of k unique integers, `stack` is a list containing the elements of `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`, and `num` is the last element of the `p` list that was processed.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `p`.
   - `max_seen` keeps track of the highest value seen so far that was not yet popped from the stack.
   - If `num` is less than `max_seen`, it means the stack cannot contain a larger element than the previous one, and the function should return -1 immediately.
   - Otherwise, the loop pops elements from the stack as long as the top of the stack is less than `num`.
   - It then pushes `num` onto the stack and updates `max_seen` if necessary.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**:
     - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
     - `total` remains 0 because there is no increment operation related to `total` within the loop.
   - **Variables that change**:
     - `stack` grows and shrinks based on the conditions inside the loop.
     - `max_seen` is updated when elements are popped from the stack.
     - `num` is the current element being processed in the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After processing all elements in `p`, the `stack` will contain the elements of `p` in non-decreasing order.
   - `max_seen` will be the largest element in the `stack` after all elements have been processed.
   - The loop will only return -1 if any element in `p` is less than `max_seen` at some point during its iteration.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - Since the loop processes all elements in `p`, the `stack` will end up with the elements of `p` in a non-decreasing order.
   - `max_seen` will be the maximum value in the `stack`.
   - `total` remains 0 as no addition operations are performed.
   - `num` will be the last element of `p` that was processed, but since we are not returning `num`, it is not explicitly included in the final state.

### Verification:
- The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the behavior of the loop as described.
- The final state of `stack` and `max_seen` are correctly determined by the loop's operations.
- The loop will only fail (return -1) if an element in `p` is smaller than `max_seen` at any point, which would mean the sequence is not strictly increasing, but this does not affect the final output state once the loop completes successfully.
