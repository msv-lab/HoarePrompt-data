Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (`stack[-1]`) is less than `num`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element.
   - `stack` is `stack` without its last element.
   - Its last element was less than `num`.
   - `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` appended to itself.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop continues if `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`, we need to ensure these conditions hold true for the next iteration.
   - `stack` is already not empty because its last element was removed in the previous iteration, and the condition `stack[-1] < num` was met to enter the loop.
   - For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `stack` still meets the condition `stack[-1] < num` in the next iteration.

Given that the last element of `stack` was less than `num` and has been removed, the new last element of `stack` should still satisfy `stack[-1] < num` for the loop to continue. Therefore, we don't need to change the state of `stack` explicitly, but we need to ensure that the last element of the new `stack` is still less than `num`.

- `remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element, so this remains unchanged.
- `stack` is now `stack` without its last element, and we know the last element was less than `num`, so the new last element must still be less than `num`.
- `result` is updated with the last element of the original `stack`, so this also remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`remaining_numbers` must have at least one more element, `stack` is `stack` without its last element and its last element must be less than `num`, `result` contains the last element of the original `stack` appended to itself**
