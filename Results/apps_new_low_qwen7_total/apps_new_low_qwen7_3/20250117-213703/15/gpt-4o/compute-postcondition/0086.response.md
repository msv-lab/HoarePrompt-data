`max_seen` is assigned the value of the last element in `stack`. After popping the last element, `stack` loses its last element, which was less than 5. The precondition that `stack` must not be empty remains true.

Output State: **`stack` does not contain the last element which was less than 5, `max_seen` is equal to the last element that was popped from `stack`**
