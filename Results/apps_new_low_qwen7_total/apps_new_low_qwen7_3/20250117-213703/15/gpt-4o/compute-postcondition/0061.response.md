The code `result.append(stack.pop())` pops the top element from the `stack` and appends it to the `result` list. Given the initial state where `stack` must not be empty and the top element of `stack` must be less than `num`, the top element of `stack` is popped and appended to `result`. The value of `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` does not contain the top element which was less than `num`; `result` contains the popped element from `stack`; `num` remains the same**
