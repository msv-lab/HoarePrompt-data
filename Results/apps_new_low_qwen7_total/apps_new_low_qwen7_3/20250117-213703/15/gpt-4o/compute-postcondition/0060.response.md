To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while stack and stack[-1] < num`.
2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `stack` does not contain the top element it previously had.
   - `result` contains the value popped from `stack`.

Given the loop condition `stack and stack[-1] < num`, the loop will continue as long as both `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `stack` must not be empty (`stack` should still exist).
- The top element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Since `stack` has changed such that it no longer contains the top element it previously had, `stack` must still be non-empty for the loop to execute again. This means the top element of `stack` must still be less than `num`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `stack` is not empty and the top element of `stack` is less than `num`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
1. Ensure `stack` is not empty: Since the top element was popped, `stack` must still have elements.
2. Ensure the top element of `stack` is less than `num`: This is required for the loop to continue.

Given these requirements, the state adjustments are:
- `stack` must be non-empty.
- The top element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

**Final State**:
State: **`stack` must not be empty and the top element of `stack` must be less than `num`**
