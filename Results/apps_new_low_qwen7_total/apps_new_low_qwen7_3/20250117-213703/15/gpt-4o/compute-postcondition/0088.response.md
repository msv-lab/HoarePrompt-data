`stack` appends the value of `num`, which is 5, to itself. The previous values of `stack`, `max_seen`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `stack` now contains elements greater than or equal to 5, including the new element 5, `max_seen` is the largest value that was popped from `stack` and is less than 5, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5].

Output State: **`stack` is [5, 5], `max_seen` is the largest value that was popped from `stack` and is less than 5, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5]**
