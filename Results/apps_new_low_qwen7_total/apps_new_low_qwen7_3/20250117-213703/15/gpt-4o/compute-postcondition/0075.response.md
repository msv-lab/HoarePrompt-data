`max_seen` is assigned the value of the top element of `stack` using `pop()`. This operation also modifies `stack` by removing the top element. The condition that the new top element in `stack` must be less than `num` is still valid.

Output State: **`max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`; the new top element in `stack` is less than `num`**
