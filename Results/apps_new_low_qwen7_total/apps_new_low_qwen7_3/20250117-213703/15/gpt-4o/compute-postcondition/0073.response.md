The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the top element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `stack` or `max_seen`. After executing the code, `max_seen` will hold the value that was popped from `stack`. The state of `stack` will be updated to remove the top element.

Output State: **`max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`; `stack` is the stack with its top element removed.**
