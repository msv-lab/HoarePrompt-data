`stack` is an empty list before the code is executed. The code appends the value of `num` to the stack. Since `num` is the first element of the list `p`, it is added to the stack. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is now `[num]`, `max_seen` is the maximum value that was popped from the stack, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.**
