To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `while stack and stack[-1] < num:`.

1. **Condition Analysis**: The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are met:
   - `stack` is not empty (`stack`)
   - The last element of `stack` is less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`)

2. **Current States**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers
   - `num` is the third element of the list `p`
   - `stack` is a list containing `[num1]`
   - `max_seen` is `num2` and is less than `num`

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - **Stack**: For the loop to continue, `stack` must not be empty. Since `stack` currently contains `[num1]`, it is not empty.
   - **Last Element of Stack**: For the loop to continue, the last element of `stack` (which is `num1`) must be less than `num`. According to the given information, `num2` is less than `num`, but we don't know if `num1` is equal to `num2`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num1` is less than `num`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num1` in the `stack` to ensure it is less than `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is a list containing `[num1]` where `num1` must be less than `num`, `max_seen` is `num2` and is less than `num`**
