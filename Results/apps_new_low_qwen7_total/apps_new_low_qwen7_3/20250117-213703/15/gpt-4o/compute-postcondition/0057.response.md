`result` is appended with the value popped from `stack`. Since `stack` must contain an element less than `num`, popping an element from `stack` removes that element, and this element is appended to `result`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` does not contain the element it previously held (which was less than `num`); `result` contains the value that was popped from `stack`.

Output State: **`stack` does not contain the element it previously held (which was less than `num`); `result` contains the value that was popped from `stack`**
