Initial State: `total` is 0, `p` is a list of k unique integers, `stack` is a list containing the elements of `p` in non-decreasing order, `max_seen` is the last element of the `stack`, and `num` is the last element of the `p` list that was processed.

Code Snippet:
```
remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)
remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)
result = p[:]
```

Analysis:
1. `remaining_numbers = set(range(1, n + 1)) - set(p)` creates a set of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are not present in the list `p`. This set is then converted to a list and sorted in descending order.
2. `remaining_numbers = sorted(remaining_numbers, reverse=True)` sorts the `remaining_numbers` list in descending order.
3. `result = p[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `p` and assigns it to `result`.

Since the code does not modify the values of `total`, `stack`, `max_seen`, or `num`, these variables remain unchanged. The `result` variable is newly introduced and assigned the value of a shallow copy of `p`.

Final Output State: **total is 0, p is a list of k unique integers, stack is a list containing the elements of p in non-decreasing order, max_seen is the last element of the stack, num is the last element of the p list that was processed, result is a list containing the same elements as p in the same order**
