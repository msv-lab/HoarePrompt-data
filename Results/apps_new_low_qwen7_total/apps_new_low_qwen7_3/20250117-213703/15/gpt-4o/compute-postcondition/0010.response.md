The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the stack and assigns it to `max_seen`. Given the initial conditions, the last element of `stack` is less than `num` and `max_seen` is the value of this last element. After popping the last element, `max_seen` will be assigned this value, and the stack will no longer contain this last element.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` does not contain the last element (which was less than `num`), `max_seen` is the value of the last element popped from `stack` (which is less than `num`).**
