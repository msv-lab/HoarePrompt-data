The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head need to be satisfied:

1. `stack` should not be empty (`stack` is a non-empty list).
2. The top element of the stack should be less than `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `max_seen` is the value popped from `stack`, and `stack` is the stack with its top element removed.

For the loop to execute again, the following adjustments are needed:
- `stack` must not be empty.
- The new top element of `stack` (after removing the previous top) must be less than `num`.

To satisfy these conditions, we need to ensure that the stack still has elements and that the new top element of the stack is less than `num`.

State: **`max_seen` is the value popped from `stack` and `stack` must have an element such that the new top element is less than `num`**
