`result` appends the value popped from `stack`. The top element of `stack` is popped and added to `result`. Therefore, the updated states are: `stack` does not contain the top element it previously had, and `result` now contains the value that was popped from `stack`.

Output State: **`stack` does not contain the top element it previously had; `result` contains the value popped from `stack`**
