Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the second element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` is now `[num]`, `max_seen` is 0, and if `num` is less than `max_seen`, the function returns -1; otherwise, the function continues execution with the current state.***
