Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is:
- `stack` contains an undefined value.
- `max_seen` is the largest value popped from `stack`.
- `num` is 5.
- `result` is [5].

The condition for the loop to execute is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
```
This means the loop continues as long as `stack` is non-empty and the last element in `stack` is less than `num` (which is 5).

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- `num` remains constant at 5 throughout the loop.
- `max_seen` is updated each time the loop pops an element from `stack`.
- `stack` loses elements that are less than 5.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue popping elements from `stack` until it either becomes empty or the last element in `stack` is no longer less than 5. Since `num` is fixed at 5, the loop stops when `stack` contains elements that are all greater than or equal to 5.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that:
- After each iteration, the last element of `stack` that was less than 5 is popped and assigned to `max_seen`.
- The loop continues until `stack` contains only elements greater than or equal to 5.

### Final Output State Calculation
- `num` remains 5.
- `result` remains [5].
- `max_seen` is the maximum value that was popped from `stack` and is less than 5.
- `stack` will contain only elements that are greater than or equal to 5 if the loop completes.

If `stack` is empty after the loop, `max_seen` will still be the last valid value that was popped before `stack` became empty. If `stack` is not empty, `max_seen` will be the largest value in `stack`.

### Final Output State
Since the loop will terminate when `stack` contains only elements greater than or equal to 5, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`stack` contains only elements greater than or equal to 5, `max_seen` is the largest value that was popped from `stack` and is less than 5, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5].**
