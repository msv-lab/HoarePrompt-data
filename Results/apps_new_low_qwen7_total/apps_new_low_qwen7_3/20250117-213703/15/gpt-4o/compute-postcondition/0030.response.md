The code `max_seen = stack.pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `max_seen`. Since `stack` contains `[num1]` and `num1` is less than `num`, popping the stack will assign `num1` to `max_seen`. The values of the other variables (`total`, `p`, `num`, and `stack`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers, `num` is the third element of the list `p`, `stack` is a list containing [], `max_seen` is `num1`**
