The code appends the value of `num` to the list `stack`. Since `num` is greater than 5, appending it to `stack` which initially is an empty list (`[]`), will result in `stack` becoming `[num]`. The values of `max_seen`, `num`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` is `[num]`, `max_seen` is 5, `num` is greater than 5, and `result` is [5, 5]**
