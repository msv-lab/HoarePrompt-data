Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `stack and stack[-1] < num`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `stack` does not contain its last element which was less than 5.
   - `max_seen` is the last element popped from `stack`.
   - `num` is 5.
   - `result` is `[5]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both `stack` should not be empty and the last element in `stack` should be less than `num`.
   - Given `num` is 5, the last element in `stack` must be less than 5.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - Since `stack` does not contain its last element which was less than 5, this means the last element popped from `stack` (which is `max_seen`) was not less than 5.
   - To make the loop execute again, the last element in `stack` must be less than 5. This can be achieved by adding an appropriate element to `stack`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The state of `stack` and `max_seen` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again.
   - We need to add an element to `stack` that is less than 5.

6. **Final state**:
   - `stack` must contain an element less than 5.
   - `max_seen` remains as the last element popped from `stack` in the previous iteration.
   - `num` remains 5.
   - `result` remains `[5]`.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:

State: **`stack` must contain an element less than 5, `max_seen` is the last element popped from `stack`, `num` is 5, and `result` is [5]**
