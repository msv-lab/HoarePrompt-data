The code `stack.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the stack. However, since `num` is undefined in the initial state, the value added to the stack is undefined. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **stack contains an undefined value, max_seen is the largest value popped from stack, num is undefined, result is an empty list.**
