Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step to determine the final output state after the loop has executed.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is:
```python
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
    result.append(stack.pop())
```
This means the loop will continue as long as the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is less than `num`.

### Track Variable Changes
- **stack**: Elements are popped from the stack if the top element is less than `num`.
- **result**: The popped elements are appended to this list.
- **num**: This variable is not modified inside the loop, so it remains invariant.

### Summary of Loop Behavior
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop pops elements from the stack and appends them to `result` until the top element of the stack is no longer less than `num`.
2. **Invariants**: `num` remains unchanged.
3. **Final State**: After the loop terminates, the stack will only contain elements that are greater than or equal to `num`. If the loop never executes, the stack remains unchanged.

### Verify Relationships
Given the information:
- After the loop executes 1 time: `stack` does not contain the element it previously held (which was less than `num`); `result` contains the value that was popped from `stack`.
- After the loop executes 2 times: `stack` does not contain the top element it previously had; `result` contains the values popped from `stack`.
- After the loop executes 3 times: `stack` does not contain the top element which was less than `num`; `result` contains the popped element from `stack`; `num` remains the same.

These observations confirm that the loop continues to pop elements from the stack while the top element is less than `num` and appends them to `result`.

### Final Output State
- **stack**: Contains elements all greater than or equal to `num`.
- **result**: Contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack` during the loop execution.
- **num**: Remains the same as the initial value.

Thus, the final output state after all the loop executions is:
Output State: **stack** contains elements all greater than or equal to `num`, **result** contains the sequence of elements that were popped from `stack`, and **num** remains the same.
