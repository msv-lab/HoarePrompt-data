`result` appends the last element of `stack` and then `stack` pops that element. Since `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`, after executing `result.append(stack.pop())`, the last element of `stack` is removed and added to `result`. The value of `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `stack` does not contain its last element (which was less than `num`), and `result` contains the last element of `stack` which was popped.**
