Output State: **stack is empty, max_seen is 0, num is the last element of remaining_numbers (which is now empty), result is a reversed list of the original stack's elements**

Explanation:
- The first line `result.extend(reversed(stack))` extends the `result` list with the reversed elements of the `stack`. Since the `stack` is initially empty, this operation does not change `result`.
- The second line `stack = []` clears the `stack`, making it empty.
- The third line `max_seen = 0` sets `max_seen` to 0.

Given that `remaining_numbers` is also mentioned to be empty after the code block, we can conclude that no new elements are added to `remaining_numbers` within the provided code block. Therefore, `num` retains its original value as the last element of `remaining_numbers` before it became empty. 

Thus, the final state includes an empty `stack`, `max_seen` set to 0, `num` being the last element of the now-empty `remaining_numbers`, and `result` containing the reversed elements of the original `stack` (which were none).
