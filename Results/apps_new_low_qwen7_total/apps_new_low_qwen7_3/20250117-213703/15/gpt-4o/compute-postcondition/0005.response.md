To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions and the given states step by step.

### Given States:
- `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\).
- `num` is the first element of the list `p`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `max_seen` is 0.
- `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```
while stack and stack[-1] < num:
```

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions inside the `while` statement must be true:

1. **Condition 1**: `stack` must not be empty (`stack` should contain at least one element).
2. **Condition 2**: The last element of `stack` must be less than `num` (`stack[-1] < num`).

Given that `stack` is initially empty, it cannot satisfy the first condition (`stack` is empty). Therefore, the loop cannot execute the first time based on the current state.

### Required Adjustments:
To make the loop execute the first time, we need to adjust the state such that `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `num`.

Since `stack` is initially empty, we need to add an element to it before the loop starts. Let's assume we add an element to `stack` such that the condition `stack[-1] < num` is satisfied.

### New State:
- `stack` must contain at least one element, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Thus, the modified state before the loop should be:
- `stack` contains at least one element, and the last element of `stack` must be less than `num`.

Since `num` is the first element of the list `p` and is greater than or equal to `max_seen`, we can choose any element from the list `p` to add to `stack` as long as it is less than `num`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `p` is a list of \(k\) unique integers where \(k \geq 1\), `num` is the first element of the list `p`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\), `stack` must contain at least one element less than `num`, `max_seen` is 0, and `num` is greater than or equal to `max_seen`**.
