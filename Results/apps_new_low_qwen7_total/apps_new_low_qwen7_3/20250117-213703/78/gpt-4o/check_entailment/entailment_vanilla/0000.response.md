### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Total Sum Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
   - If the total sum is already odd, it prints the total sum, which is correct.

2. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - When the total sum is even, the code aims to find the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number.
   - If the total sum is even, we need to remove either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number to make the sum odd and maximize the sum of the remaining elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code uses `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` to handle cases where there are no positive or negative odd numbers respectively.
   - For each odd number found, it updates `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` accordingly.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - If there is a positive odd number, it calculates the new sum by subtracting the smallest positive odd number from the total sum.
   - If there is a negative odd number, it calculates the new sum by subtracting the largest negative odd number from the total sum.
   - It prints the maximum of these two results.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first example (`-2 2 -3 1`), the total sum is 0 (even), and the minimum positive odd number is 1. Removing 1 makes the sum 3, which is the correct answer.
   - For the second example (`2 -5 -3`), the total sum is -6 (even), and the maximum negative odd number is -5. Removing -5 makes the sum -1, which is the correct answer.

Given this analysis, the logic of the provided code matches the problem statement correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
