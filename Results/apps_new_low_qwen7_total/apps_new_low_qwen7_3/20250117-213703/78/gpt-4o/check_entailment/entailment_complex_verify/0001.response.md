### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Total Sum Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
   - If the total sum is already odd, it prints the total sum, which is correct.

2. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - The approach of finding the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number is sound. However, the implementation has some issues:
     - When the total sum is even, the code should aim to maximize the sum of the subsequence by removing the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number.
     - The current implementation only considers the subtraction of these values from the total sum. This might not always yield the optimal subsequence sum because:
       - The code does not consider the possibility of constructing a subsequence using both the smallest positive odd number and any subset of the remaining elements to achieve an odd sum greater than just removing a single element.
       - The code does not account for the scenario where the total sum minus the smallest positive odd number might still yield an even number, which is invalid.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The use of `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` to handle cases where there are no positive or negative odd numbers is correct.
   - However, the logic for determining the result needs to be more robust. The current implementation only considers the subtraction of the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number, which might not always give the maximum odd sum.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The current logic for calculating the results (`result1` and `result2`) only considers the direct subtraction of the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number. This might miss out on the optimal subsequence sum.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - While the test cases provided in the original assessment are correct and the code passes them, they do not cover all possible edge cases. For example, if the sequence has multiple positive and negative odd numbers, the current implementation might not find the optimal subsequence sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code does not guarantee that it will find the subsequence with the maximum odd sum. The current implementation only considers direct subtraction of the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number, which might not always yield the optimal result.

### Final:
**False**
