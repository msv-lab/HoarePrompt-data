### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Total Sum Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
   - If the total sum is already odd, it prints the total sum, which is correct.

2. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - The code aims to find the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number to adjust the total sum to be odd and maximized.
   - However, the logic for handling the case where the total sum is even has a flaw. Specifically, the approach of subtracting the minimum positive odd number or the maximum negative odd number might not always yield the maximum possible sum.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code uses `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` to handle cases where there are no positive or negative odd numbers respectively, which is correct.
   - The issue arises when the total sum is even, and the code tries to remove the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number to make the sum odd. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible sum because it does not consider all possible combinations of removing elements to achieve the desired odd sum.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The current implementation only considers removing one element (either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number) to make the sum odd. This might not be the optimal solution. For instance, in the case where there are multiple positive and negative odd numbers, removing just one might not yield the maximum possible sum.
   - A better approach would be to consider all possible combinations of elements that can be removed to achieve the maximum odd sum. This could involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to explore different subsets of the array.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases do not cover all possible edge cases, such as sequences with multiple positive and negative odd numbers. The current implementation might fail for such cases.

Given this analysis, the logic of the provided code does not necessarily match the problem statement correctly because it does not guarantee the maximum possible sum when the total sum is even. It only considers a limited set of operations (removing one element) instead of exploring all possible combinations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code does not guarantee the correct solution for all possible inputs, especially when the total sum is even.

**Final: False**
