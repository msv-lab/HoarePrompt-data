You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and a sequence of \( n \) integers from standard input. It calculates the total sum of the sequence and finds the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number within the sequence. Based on the parity of the total sum, it either prints the total sum directly or computes two potential new sums: one by subtracting the minimum positive odd number from the total sum (if it exists), and another by subtracting the maximum negative odd number from the total sum (if it exists). Finally, it prints the larger of these two computed sums. The function does not return a value but modifies the output stream directly. Potential edge cases include sequences without positive or negative odd numbers, which are handled by setting `min_positive_odd` to positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` to negative infinity, ensuring that the resulting sums are appropriately set to negative infinity.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Total Sum Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
   - If the total sum is already odd, it prints the total sum, which is correct.

2. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - When the total sum is even, the code aims to find the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number.
   - If the total sum is even, we need to remove either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number to make the sum odd and maximize the sum of the remaining elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code uses `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` to handle cases where there are no positive or negative odd numbers respectively.
   - For each odd number found, it updates `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` accordingly.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - If there is a positive odd number, it calculates the new sum by subtracting the smallest positive odd number from the total sum.
   - If there is a negative odd number, it calculates the new sum by subtracting the largest negative odd number from the total sum.
   - It prints the maximum of these two results.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first example (`-2 2 -3 1`), the total sum is 0 (even), and the minimum positive odd number is 1. Removing 1 makes the sum 3, which is the correct answer.
   - For the second example (`2 -5 -3`), the total sum is -6 (even), and the maximum negative odd number is -5. Removing -5 makes the sum -1, which is the correct answer.

Given this analysis, the logic of the provided code matches the problem statement correctly.
