### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Total Sum Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
   - If the total sum is already odd, it prints the total sum, which is correct.

2. **Handling Even Total Sum**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`) and the maximum negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`) is correct.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the final result is calculated. Specifically, the current implementation does not ensure that the resulting subsequence actually has an odd sum.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The use of `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')` to handle cases where there are no positive or negative odd numbers is appropriate.
   - The logic updates `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` correctly as it iterates through the list `a`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The current approach assumes that removing either the smallest positive odd number or the largest negative odd number will always result in an odd sum. This assumption is flawed because it does not consider all possible combinations of odd and even numbers that could form an odd sum subsequence.
   - For example, consider the input `[1, -1, 2, -2]`. The total sum is 0 (even), and both `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` are 1 and -1, respectively. The code would subtract 1 from the total sum, resulting in 1, but the actual maximum odd sum subsequence here could be `[1, -1]` which sums to 0.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - While the provided examples (`-2 2 -3 1` and `2 -5 -3`) work correctly, they do not cover all edge cases. The previous test case (`[1, -1, 2, -2]`) demonstrates a scenario where the current logic fails.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code does not guarantee that the resulting subsequence will have an odd sum, even if the total sum is even. A more comprehensive approach is needed to ensure that the resulting subsequence has an odd sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
