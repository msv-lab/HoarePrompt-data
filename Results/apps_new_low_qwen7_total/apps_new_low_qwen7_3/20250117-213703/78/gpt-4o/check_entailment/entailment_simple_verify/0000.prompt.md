You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of integer numbers of length n. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4). The sequence contains at least one subsequence with odd sum.


-----Output-----

Print sum of resulting subseqeuence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
-2 2 -3 1

Output
3

Input
3
2 -5 -3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example sum of the second and the fourth elements is 3.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(a)
    min_positive_odd = float('inf')
    max_negative_odd = float('-inf')
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print(total_sum)
    else:
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                if num > 0:
                    min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
                else:
                    max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)
        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf') else float('-inf')
        result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf') else float('-inf')
        print(max(result1, result2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (-10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4), representing the sequence. The sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.

        result1 = total_sum - min_positive_odd if min_positive_odd != float('inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

result2 = total_sum - max_negative_odd if max_negative_odd != float('-inf'
    ) else float('-inf')

print(max(result1, result2))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum positive odd number encountered in the list `a` (or positive infinity if no positive odd numbers are present), `max_negative_odd` is the maximum negative odd number encountered in the list `a` (or negative infinity if no negative odd numbers are present). If `total_sum` is odd, `min_positive_odd` remains as positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` remains as negative infinity. Otherwise, `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` reflect the minimum positive odd and maximum negative odd numbers in the list `a`, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for finding the minimum positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`) and the maximum negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`) is flawed. This logic only considers removing one positive odd number or one negative odd number to make the total sum odd, but it does not consider other possible combinations that could yield a larger odd sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -3 2 -4
```
The program will output `-5` because it subtracts the smallest positive odd number `1` from the total sum `0`. However, the correct output should be `3`, which can be achieved by including the subsequence `[1, -3, 2]`.

The program needs to evaluate all possible subsequences to ensure the sum is maximized while being odd. The current implementation only tries to remove one element, which is insufficient to guarantee the correct result in all cases.
