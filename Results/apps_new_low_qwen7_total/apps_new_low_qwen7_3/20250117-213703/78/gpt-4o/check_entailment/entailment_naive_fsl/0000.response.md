Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for finding the minimum positive odd number (`min_positive_odd`) and the maximum negative odd number (`max_negative_odd`) is flawed. This logic only considers removing one positive odd number or one negative odd number to make the total sum odd, but it does not consider other possible combinations that could yield a larger odd sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -3 2 -4
```
The program will output `-5` because it subtracts the smallest positive odd number `1` from the total sum `0`. However, the correct output should be `3`, which can be achieved by including the subsequence `[1, -3, 2]`.

The program needs to evaluate all possible subsequences to ensure the sum is maximized while being odd. The current implementation only tries to remove one element, which is insufficient to guarantee the correct result in all cases.
