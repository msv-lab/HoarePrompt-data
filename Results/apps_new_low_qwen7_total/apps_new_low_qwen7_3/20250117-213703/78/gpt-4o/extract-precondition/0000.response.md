Precondition: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (-10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4), representing the sequence. The sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum.**
