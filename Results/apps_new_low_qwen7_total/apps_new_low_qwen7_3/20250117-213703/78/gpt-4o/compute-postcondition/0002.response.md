The code `print(total_sum)` simply prints the value of `total_sum`. Since printing does not change the value of any variables, the value of `total_sum` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is positive infinity, `max_negative_odd` is negative infinity, and the `total_sum` is odd**
