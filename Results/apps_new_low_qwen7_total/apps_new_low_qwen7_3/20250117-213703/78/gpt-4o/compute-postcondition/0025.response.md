The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but takes input from the user in the form of two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, representing the length of the sequence. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` where `-10^4 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4`, representing the sequence. The sequence contains at least one subsequence with an odd sum. The function returns whether there exists a subsequence with an odd sum.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but takes an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers as input, and returns True if there exists a subsequence with an odd sum.**
