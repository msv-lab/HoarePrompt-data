Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum positive odd number encountered in the list `a` (or positive infinity if no positive odd numbers are present), `max_negative_odd` is the maximum negative odd number encountered in the list `a` (or negative infinity if no negative odd numbers are present). If `total_sum` is odd, `min_positive_odd` remains as positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` remains as negative infinity. Otherwise, `min_positive_odd` and `max_negative_odd` reflect the minimum positive odd and maximum negative odd numbers in the list `a`, respectively.**
