The code updates `max_negative_odd` to be the maximum of its current value (`negative infinity`) and `num`. Since `num` is less than or equal to 0 and is an odd integer, `max_negative_odd` will be updated to `num` because it is now the maximum value between `negative infinity` and `num`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is positive infinity, `max_negative_odd` is `num`, and `num` is the first element in the list `a`.**
