Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum positive odd number encountered (either from the current `min_positive_odd` or the current `num` if it's positive and odd), `max_negative_odd` is the maximum negative odd number encountered (updated based on the next element in the list `a` if `num` is not negative and odd, otherwise updated based on the current `max_negative_odd` and `num`). `num` is the next element in the list `a`.***
