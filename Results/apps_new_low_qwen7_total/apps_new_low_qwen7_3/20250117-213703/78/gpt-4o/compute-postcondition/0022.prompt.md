Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is positive infinity, `max_negative_odd` is negative infinity, and `total_sum` is even
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        if num > 0:
            min_positive_odd = min(min_positive_odd, num)
        else:
            max_negative_odd = max(max_negative_odd, num)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`. If the first element of `a` (which is `num`) is a positive odd number, `min_positive_odd` is set to `num` and `max_negative_odd` remains negative infinity. If the first element of `a` is a negative odd number, `max_negative_odd` is set to `num`. Otherwise, `min_positive_odd` remains positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` remains negative infinity.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum positive odd number encountered (either from the current `min_positive_odd` or the current `num` if it's positive and odd), `max_negative_odd` is the maximum negative odd number encountered (updated based on the next element in the list `a` if `num` is not negative and odd, otherwise updated based on the current `max_negative_odd` and `num`). `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `min_positive_odd` is the minimum positive odd number encountered (updated based on whether `num` is positive and odd), `max_negative_odd` is the maximum negative odd number encountered (updated based on whether `num` is negative and odd), `num` is the next element in the list `a`, if `num` is odd, it updates the respective minimum or maximum value as needed.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
