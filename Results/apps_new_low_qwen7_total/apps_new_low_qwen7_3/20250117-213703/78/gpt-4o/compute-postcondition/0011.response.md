Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `a`. If the first element of `a` (which is `num`) is a positive odd number, `min_positive_odd` is set to `num` and `max_negative_odd` remains negative infinity. If the first element of `a` is a negative odd number, `max_negative_odd` is set to `num`. Otherwise, `min_positive_odd` remains positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` remains negative infinity.***
