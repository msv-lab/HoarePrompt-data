The function reads an integer \( n \) and a sequence of \( n \) integers from standard input. It calculates the total sum of the sequence and finds the minimum positive odd number and the maximum negative odd number within the sequence. Based on the parity of the total sum, it either prints the total sum directly or computes two potential new sums: one by subtracting the minimum positive odd number from the total sum (if it exists), and another by subtracting the maximum negative odd number from the total sum (if it exists). Finally, it prints the larger of these two computed sums. The function does not return a value but modifies the output stream directly. Potential edge cases include sequences without positive or negative odd numbers, which are handled by setting `min_positive_odd` to positive infinity and `max_negative_odd` to negative infinity, ensuring that the resulting sums are appropriately set to negative infinity.
