The provided code snippet does not include the complete logic to determine the number of snoozes based on the wake-up time and the interval `x`. However, we can infer the following from the given lines:

1. The first line reads an integer input and assigns it to `x`.
2. The second line takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `hh` and `mm`.
3. The third line initializes `snooze_count` to 0.

Since no further operations are performed on `x`, `hh`, `mm`, or `snooze_count` within the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button.
- `hh` and `mm` are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format.
- `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.

The final output state remains as follows:
Output State: **x is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button, hh and mm are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format, func_1(hh, mm) returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise, snooze_count is 0**
