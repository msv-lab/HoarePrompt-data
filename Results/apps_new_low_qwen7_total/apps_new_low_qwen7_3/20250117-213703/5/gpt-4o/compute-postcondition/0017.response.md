Output State: **hh is unchanged - 1, mm is unchanged + 60, snooze_count is incremented by 1, x is unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line `mm += 60` adds 60 to the current value of `mm`.
- The second line `hh -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `hh`.

Since the initial state mentions that `hh` and `mm` are unchanged except for the specified operations, and `x` and `snooze_count` remain unchanged, the final state is updated accordingly.
