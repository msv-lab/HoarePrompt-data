The loop condition `while not func_1(hh, mm)` means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. From the given information, `hh` and `mm` are unchanged from the previous iteration, and `snooze_count` is incremented by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. The states that can be adjusted are `hh` and `mm`.

Since `hh` and `mm` are unchanged, they need to be adjusted such that `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. Given that `mm` cannot be negative (as stated in the problem), the only way to satisfy the loop condition is to ensure that `func_1(hh, mm)` is still `False` for the current values of `hh` and `mm`.

Therefore, no changes need to be made to `hh` and `mm` directly because they are already in a state where `func_1(hh, mm)` could return `False`. The only state that needs to be ensured is that `snooze_count` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`hh` is unchanged, `mm` is unchanged, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1**
