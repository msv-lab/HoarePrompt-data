The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `x`, `hh`, and `mm`. `x` is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button, `hh` and `mm` are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59). The function also calls `func_1(hh, mm)` which returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.

Based on the given constraints and the call to `func_1`, the function does not explicitly return anything from within the provided snippet. However, considering the typical structure of such functions, the return value would depend on the result of `func_1(hh, mm)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `x`, `hh`, and `mm`, and return the result of `func_1(hh, mm)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x`, `hh`, and `mm`, and returns the result of `func_1(hh, mm)`.**
