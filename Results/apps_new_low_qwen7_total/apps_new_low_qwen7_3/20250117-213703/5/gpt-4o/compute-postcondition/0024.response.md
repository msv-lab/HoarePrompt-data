Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer representing the snooze interval in minutes), `hh` (an integer representing the hour part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format), and `mm` (an integer representing the minute part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format). The function continuously decreases the `mm` value by `x` every iteration of the while loop until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', as determined by the function `func_1(hh, mm)`. If the `mm` value goes below zero during the subtraction, it wraps around to the next minute. Similarly, if the `hh` value goes below zero, it wraps around to the next day. The function increments a counter `snooze_count` with each iteration of the loop. Once the condition in `func_1(hh, mm)` is met, the function prints the value of `snooze_count` and does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `hh` and `mm` have been adjusted to the nearest valid time where `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True, and `snooze_count` reflects the number of iterations needed to reach this state.**

**Potential edge cases include:**
- If `x` is greater than 60, `mm` might wrap around multiple times before reaching a valid time.
- If the initial `hh:mm` already contains the digit '7', no iterations will occur, and `snooze_count` will be 0.
- If `hh` and `mm` represent a time after midnight (e.g., 23:60), they will wrap around correctly.**

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `x`, `hh`, or `mm`, or values outside the valid range for time (e.g., `hh` < 0 or `mm` > 59).
