The code `hh += 24` increments the value of `hh` by 24. Given that the initial state is `hh` is unchanged -1 (meaning its value is -1) and the condition that the current value of `hh` is less than 0, adding 24 to -1 results in 23. The other variables `mm` and `snooze_count` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`hh` is 23, `mm` is a positive number at least 59, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, the current value of `hh` is less than 0**
