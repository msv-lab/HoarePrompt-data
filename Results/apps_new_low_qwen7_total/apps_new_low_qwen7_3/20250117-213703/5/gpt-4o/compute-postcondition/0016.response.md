Output State: **hh is unchanged, mm is unchanged, snooze_count is incremented by 1, x is unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line increments `snooze_count` by 1.
- The second line subtracts the value of `x` from `mm`.
Since the initial state specifies that `hh` and `mm` are unchanged, and there is no value given for `x`, it remains unchanged. The only variable that is modified is `snooze_count`, which is incremented by 1.
