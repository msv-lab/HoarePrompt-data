`hh` is incremented by 24. Since `hh` was initially `-1`, adding 24 to it results in `23`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh` is 23, `mm` is unchanged + 60, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, `x` is unchanged.

Output State: **`hh` is 23, `mm` is unchanged + 60, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, `x` is unchanged**
