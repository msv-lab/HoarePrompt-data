Output State: **hh is unchanged -1, mm is unchanged +60, snooze_count is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state mentions that `hh` and `mm` are unchanged, meaning their values remain the same before the code execution. The code then increments `snooze_count` by 1, so `snooze_count` is now one more than its initial value.
- The first line `mm += 60` adds 60 to the current value of `mm`.
- The second line `hh -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `hh`.

Since the exact initial values of `hh` and `mm` were not provided, they are represented as "unchanged -1" and "unchanged +60" respectively, indicating the operations performed on them. The `snooze_count` is explicitly stated to be incremented by 1.
