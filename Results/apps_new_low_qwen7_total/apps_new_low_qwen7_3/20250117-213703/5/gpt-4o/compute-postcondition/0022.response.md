The code `print(snooze_count)` does not change any variables but simply prints the value of `snooze_count`. Based on the initial state, `snooze_count` is incremented by the number of iterations until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `snooze_count`, which is now the number of iterations it took for `func_1(hh, mm)` to return True. Since the initial state does not specify the exact behavior of `func_1(hh, mm)`, we can only say that `snooze_count` is updated to reflect the number of iterations needed for the function to return True.

Output State: **`hh` is reduced by the total amount of minutes divided by `x` until it becomes 23, `mm` is reduced by the total amount of minutes modulo 60 until it is 59 or less, `snooze_count` is the number of iterations until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True, `x` remains unchanged, `print(snooze_count)` is executed.**
