Initial State: hh is unchanged, mm is unchanged, snooze_count is incremented by 1. The current value of mm is less than 0.
```
```
mm += 60
hh -= 1
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `mm += 60` adds 60 to the current value of `mm`. Since `mm` is currently less than 0, adding 60 will make `mm` a positive number.
2. The second line `hh -= 1` decrements `hh` by 1. Since `hh` was unchanged in the initial state, this operation reduces `hh` by 1.

Given these operations, we can conclude:
- `mm` will now be a positive number (specifically, it will be at least 59 since it was originally less than 0).
- `hh` will be reduced by 1 from its original value.
- `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, but no specific value is given, so it remains just incremented without a numeric value.

Final Output State: **hh is unchanged - 1, mm is a positive number at least 59, snooze_count is incremented by 1**
