The loop continues as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`. To proceed to the next iteration, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False` at the end of the current iteration. The only variables in the loop head are `hh` and `mm`. However, since the problem statement mentions that `hh` and `mm` are unchanged, they cannot be adjusted. Therefore, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to keep `func_1(hh, mm)` returning `False`.

Since no adjustments can be made to `hh` and `mm`, the state remains as described in the precondition.

State: **`hh` is unchanged, `mm` is unchanged, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1. Since the condition `mm < 0` is false, the values of `hh` and `mm` remain as specified in the precondition.**
