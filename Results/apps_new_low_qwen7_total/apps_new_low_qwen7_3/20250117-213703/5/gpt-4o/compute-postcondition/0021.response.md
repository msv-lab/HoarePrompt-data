Output State: **hh is reduced by the total amount of minutes divided by x until it becomes 23, mm is reduced by the total amount of minutes modulo 60 until it is 59 or less, snooze_count is incremented by the number of iterations until the condition func_1(hh, mm) returns True, x remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues to run as long as `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.
   - In each iteration, `snooze_count` is incremented by 1, `mm` is decremented by `x`, and if `mm` becomes negative, it wraps around to `mm + 60` and `hh` is decremented by 1. If `hh` becomes negative, it wraps around to `hh + 24`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `func_1(hh, mm)` determines whether the loop will continue.
   - `snooze_count` is incremented in every iteration.
   - `mm` and `hh` are adjusted based on the value of `x` and whether `mm` goes below zero.
   - `x` remains constant and is not modified within the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to run until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`. This means the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'.
   - Each iteration decreases `mm` by `x` and possibly adjusts `hh` and `mm` to ensure `mm` is within the range [0, 59].
   - `snooze_count` keeps track of the number of iterations taken to reach the desired condition.

4. **Final Values**:
   - Once the loop exits, `hh` and `mm` will form a time that contains the digit '7', and `snooze_count` will be the number of times the loop executed.
   - `x` will remain the same as its initial value.
   - The exact final values of `hh` and `mm` depend on the initial values and the number of iterations, but `hh` will be reduced by the total number of minutes divided by `x` until it becomes 23 (the last valid hour before containing '7'), and `mm` will be reduced by the remainder of the total minutes modulo 60.

### Example:

If the initial state is `hh = 22`, `mm = 45`, and `x = 15`, the loop will execute until `func_1(22, 45)` returns `False`. After the loop, `hh` might be 23 (if the subtraction caused `hh` to drop below 22), and `mm` will be adjusted to a value between 0 and 59. The exact values depend on the number of iterations.
