Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `not func_1(hh, mm)` is true. This means the loop will execute if `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`.

2. **Understand `func_1(hh, mm)`**: The function `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True` if the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`, meaning `hh:mm` does not contain the digit '7'.

3. **Initial states**:
   - `x` is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `hh` and `mm` are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format.
   - `snooze_count` is 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).

4. **Loop head requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(hh, mm)` must return `False`, i.e., the time `hh:mm` should not contain the digit '7'.

Since `x`, `snooze_count`, and the specific values of `hh` and `mm` do not directly affect whether `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `False`, the only relevant state for the loop to execute the first time is the condition on `hh` and `mm`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be:

State: **`hh` and `mm` must not contain the digit '7'**
