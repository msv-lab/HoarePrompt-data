The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `h` (an integer representing the hour, 00 to 23) and `m` (an integer representing the minute, 00 to 59), and checks if the digit '7' appears in the string representation of the hour or minute. If the digit '7' is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes all possible cases where `h` or `m` could contain the digit '7', such as 17, 207, 14:37, etc. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the edge cases are correctly handled by checking both the hour and minute as strings.
