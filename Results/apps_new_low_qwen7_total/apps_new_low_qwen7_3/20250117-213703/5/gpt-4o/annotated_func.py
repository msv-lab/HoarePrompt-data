#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is an integer representing the hour (00 to 23), m is an integer representing the minute (00 to 59), and the function checks if the time h:m contains the digit '7'.
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)
    #`The program returns True if the digit 7 appears in the hour (h) or minute (m) as a string, otherwise returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `h` (an integer representing the hour, 00 to 23) and `m` (an integer representing the minute, 00 to 59), and checks if the digit '7' appears in the string representation of the hour or minute. If the digit '7' is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes all possible cases where `h` or `m` could contain the digit '7', such as 17, 207, 14:37, etc. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the edge cases are correctly handled by checking both the hour and minute as strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button, hh and mm are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59), and func_1(hh, mm) returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.
def func_2():
    x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        
        mm -= x
        
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: hh is reduced by the total amount of minutes divided by x until it becomes 23, mm is reduced by the total amount of minutes modulo 60 until it is 59 or less, snooze_count is incremented by the number of iterations until the condition func_1(hh, mm) returns True, x remains unchanged.
    print(snooze_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer representing the snooze interval in minutes), `hh` (an integer representing the hour part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format), and `mm` (an integer representing the minute part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format). The function continuously decreases the `mm` value by `x` every iteration of the while loop until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', as determined by the function `func_1(hh, mm)`. If the `mm` value goes below zero during the subtraction, it wraps around to the next minute. Similarly, if the `hh` value goes below zero, it wraps around to the next day. The function increments a counter `snooze_count` with each iteration of the loop. Once the condition in `func_1(hh, mm)` is met, the function prints the value of `snooze_count` and does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `hh` and `mm` have been adjusted to the nearest valid time where `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True, and `snooze_count` reflects the number of iterations needed to reach this state.
