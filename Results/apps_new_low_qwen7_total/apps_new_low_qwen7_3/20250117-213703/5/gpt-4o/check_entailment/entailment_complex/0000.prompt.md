Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is an integer representing the hour (00 to 23), m is an integer representing the minute (00 to 59), and the function checks if the time h:m contains the digit '7'.
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)
    #`The program returns True if the digit 7 appears in the hour (h) or minute (m) as a string, otherwise returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `h` (an integer representing the hour, 00 to 23) and `m` (an integer representing the minute, 00 to 59), and checks if the digit '7' appears in the string representation of the hour or minute. If the digit '7' is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes all possible cases where `h` or `m` could contain the digit '7', such as 17, 207, 14:37, etc. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the edge cases are correctly handled by checking both the hour and minute as strings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button, hh and mm are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59), and func_1(hh, mm) returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.
def func_2():
    x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        
        mm -= x
        
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: hh is reduced by the total amount of minutes divided by x until it becomes 23, mm is reduced by the total amount of minutes modulo 60 until it is 59 or less, snooze_count is incremented by the number of iterations until the condition func_1(hh, mm) returns True, x remains unchanged.
    print(snooze_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer representing the snooze interval in minutes), `hh` (an integer representing the hour part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format), and `mm` (an integer representing the minute part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format). The function continuously decreases the `mm` value by `x` every iteration of the while loop until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', as determined by the function `func_1(hh, mm)`. If the `mm` value goes below zero during the subtraction, it wraps around to the next minute. Similarly, if the `hh` value goes below zero, it wraps around to the next day. The function increments a counter `snooze_count` with each iteration of the loop. Once the condition in `func_1(hh, mm)` is met, the function prints the value of `snooze_count` and does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `hh` and `mm` have been adjusted to the nearest valid time where `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True, and `snooze_count` reflects the number of iterations needed to reach this state.
