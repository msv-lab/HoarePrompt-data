Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the time `h:m` contains the digit '7' by converting the hour and minute to strings and checking for the presence of '7'.
   - It handles all valid inputs for hours and minutes within the specified ranges (00 to 23 for hours, 00 to 59 for minutes).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of times the snooze button needs to be pressed to reach a lucky time (`h:m` containing '7').
   - It uses a while loop to decrement the minutes (`mm`) by the snooze interval (`x`) and adjusts the hours (`hh`) and minutes (`mm`) appropriately when they go out of bounds (e.g., `mm < 0` or `hh < 0`).
   - The loop continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, indicating that the current time contains the digit '7'.
   - The count of iterations (`snooze_count`) accurately reflects the number of times the snooze button was pressed.

Given the detailed analysis of both functions, they correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions handle all edge cases properly, and the overall solution meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
