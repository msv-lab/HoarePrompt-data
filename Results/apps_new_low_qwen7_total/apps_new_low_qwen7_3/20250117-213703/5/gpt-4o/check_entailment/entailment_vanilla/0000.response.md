### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to find the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time (a time containing the digit '7') starting from a given time \(hh:mm\), with snoozes happening every \(x\) minutes.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a given time \(h:m\) contains the digit '7'.
   - It correctly checks both hours and minutes.
   
3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values for \(x\), \(hh\), and \(mm\).
   - It initializes the count of snoozes to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time is lucky using `func_1`.
   - If the time is not lucky, it decreases the minute value by \(x\) and handles the wrap-around for minutes and hours appropriately.
   - It increments the snooze count each time the time is not lucky.
   - Once a lucky time is reached, it prints the count of snoozes.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct, converting string inputs to integers.

5. **Time Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic for adjusting the time (minutes and hours) and handling the 24-hour format is correct.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be logically sound and should work as expected for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
