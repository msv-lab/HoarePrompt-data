Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly defines the functions `func_1` and `func_2` as per the problem statement.
2. `func_1` checks if the current time (represented by `h` and `m`) contains the digit '7', which is correctly implemented.
3. `func_2` reads the input values `x`, `hh`, and `mm`. It then iteratively decreases the minutes (`mm`) by `x` and adjusts the hours (`hh`) and minutes (`mm`) according to the 24-hour clock rules until a lucky time (containing '7') is reached.
4. The loop increments `snooze_count` each time the minutes are decreased by `x` without finding a lucky time, and correctly handles the cases where `mm` goes below zero or `hh` goes below zero by wrapping around to the next hour or day.
5. The final output is the count of how many times the snooze button was pressed, which is the number of iterations required to reach a lucky time.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and implementation match the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
