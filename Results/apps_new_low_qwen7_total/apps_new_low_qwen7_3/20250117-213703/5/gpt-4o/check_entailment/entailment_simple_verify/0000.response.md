### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the current time `h:m` contains the digit '7'.
   - It works correctly by converting both `h` and `mm` to strings and checking if '7' is present in either string.
   - This is a correct implementation and ensures that we can accurately determine if a time is lucky.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the inputs: `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - Initializes `snooze_count` to 0.
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues until the current time `hh:mm` is lucky (i.e., contains the digit '7').
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - Increments `snooze_count` by 1.
     - Decreases `mm` by `x` minutes.
     - If `mm` goes below 0, it wraps around by adding 60 minutes and decreasing `hh` by 1. This also wraps `hh` around to 24 if it goes below 0.

### Key Points to Validate:

1. **Time Wrapping Logic:**
   - The logic for wrapping around `hh` and `mm` is correct. When `mm` goes below 0, it correctly adjusts `mm` to be within the range `[0, 59]` and decreases `hh` by 1. Similarly, if `hh` goes below 0, it wraps around to 24.

2. **Loop Termination Condition:**
   - The loop terminates when `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, meaning the current time is lucky. This ensures that the smallest number of snoozes is counted.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the target time itself might already be a lucky time (e.g., `01:07`).
   - It also correctly handles times like `23:59` transitioning to `00:00`.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is straightforward and follows the problem's constraints.

### Validation Against Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `func_2` is called with valid inputs `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Checks if the current time `h:m` contains the digit '7'.
  - Returns `True` or `False` correctly.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Iterates correctly, reducing `mm` by `x` and wrapping around as needed.
  - Terminates the loop when a lucky time is found, ensuring the smallest number of snoozes is counted.

### Conclusion:

After systematically evaluating the program and comparing it with the annotations, it is clear that the program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7'. The program handles all edge cases and input scenarios as required.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
