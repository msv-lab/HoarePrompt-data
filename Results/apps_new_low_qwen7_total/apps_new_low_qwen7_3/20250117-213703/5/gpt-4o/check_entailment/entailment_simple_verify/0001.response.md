### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time (a time containing the digit '7') starting from a given time \(hh:mm\), with snoozes happening every \(x\) minutes.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a given time \(h:m\) contains the digit '7'.
   - It correctly checks both hours and minutes.
   - The function is logically correct and should work as intended.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values for \(x\), \(hh\), and \(mm\).
   - It initializes the count of snoozes to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time is lucky using `func_1`.
   - If the time is not lucky, it decreases the minute value by \(x\) and handles the wrap-around for minutes and hours appropriately.
   - It increments the snooze count each time the time is not lucky.
   - Once a lucky time is reached, it prints the count of snoozes.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct, converting string inputs to integers.

5. **Time Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic for adjusting the time (minutes and hours) and handling the 24-hour format is correct.
   - Specifically, the logic ensures that if minutes go below zero, they are adjusted by adding 60 and decrementing the hour. Similarly, if hours go below zero, they are adjusted by adding 24.

6. **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - They confirm that the program logic correctly simulates the passage of time and the incrementation of the snooze count until a lucky time is reached.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be logically sound and should work as expected for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of snoozes required to reach a lucky time.

### Final:
**True**
