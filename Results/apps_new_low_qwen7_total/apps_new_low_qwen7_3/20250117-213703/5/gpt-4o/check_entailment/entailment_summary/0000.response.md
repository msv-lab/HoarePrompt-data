Reasoning: 
The program seems to be correctly designed to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks whether a given time (in hours and minutes) contains the digit '7'.
   - It correctly handles all cases where either the hour or the minute might contain the digit '7'.
   - The implementation is simple and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values for `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes a counter `snooze_count` to count the number of snoozes.
   - It enters a loop where it repeatedly subtracts `x` from `mm` until the resulting time contains the digit '7'.
   - Proper handling of time wrap-around is implemented for both hours and minutes.
   - The loop continues until the condition in `func_1(hh, mm)` is satisfied, meaning the time now contains the digit '7'.
   - The counter `snooze_count` is incremented appropriately, reflecting the number of times the snooze button was pressed.

Given these points, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button to reach a lucky time (`hh:mm` containing the digit '7').

Correctness: **True**
