### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if either the hour or minute contains the digit '7'. This is done by converting both `h` and `m` to strings and checking if '7' is in either string.
   - This function handles all edge cases correctly, including leading zeros (e.g., `17`, `207`, `14:37`).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The main function `func_2` correctly reads the input values `x`, `hh`, and `mm`.
   - It initializes `snooze_count` to zero.
   - It enters a loop that continues to decrement `mm` by `x` until the current time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7'.
   - The loop handles wrap-around cases correctly:
     - If `mm` goes below zero, it adds 60 to `mm` and decrements `hh` by one.
     - If `hh` goes below zero, it adds 24 to `hh` to wrap around to the next day.
   - The loop increments `snooze_count` with each iteration.
   - The loop terminates when `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`, meaning the current time is lucky.
   - The function then prints the value of `snooze_count`.

3. **Annotations Verification**:
   - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the wrap-around cases and increments the snooze count appropriately.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program stops once a lucky time is found, ensuring the smallest number of snoozes is returned.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial time `hh:mm` itself is lucky.
   - It also handles cases where the initial time is not lucky and requires multiple iterations to reach a lucky time.
   - The program correctly adjusts the time across days when necessary.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7'.
   - The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the wrap-around scenarios and the initial lucky time scenario.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
