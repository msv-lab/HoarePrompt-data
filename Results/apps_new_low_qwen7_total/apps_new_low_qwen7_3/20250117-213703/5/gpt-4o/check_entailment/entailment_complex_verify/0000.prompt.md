You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x·y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 60).

The second line contains two two-digit integers, hh and mm (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
11 23

Output
2

Input
5
01 07

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.

In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    x = int(input())
    (hh, mm) = map(int, input().split())
    snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        mm -= x
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
    print(snooze_count)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is an integer representing the hour (00 to 23), m is an integer representing the minute (00 to 59), and the function checks if the time h:m contains the digit '7'.
def func_1(h, m):
    """Check if the time h:m contains a '7'."""
    return '7' in str(h) or '7' in str(m)
    #`The program returns True if the digit 7 appears in the hour (h) or minute (m) as a string, otherwise returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `h` (an integer representing the hour, 00 to 23) and `m` (an integer representing the minute, 00 to 59), and checks if the digit '7' appears in the string representation of the hour or minute. If the digit '7' is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes all possible cases where `h` or `m` could contain the digit '7', such as 17, 207, 14:37, etc. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the edge cases are correctly handled by checking both the hour and minute as strings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the interval in minutes for pressing the snooze button, hh and mm are integers representing the target wake-up time in 24-hour format (00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59), and func_1(hh, mm) returns True if the time hh:mm contains the digit '7' and False otherwise.
def func_2():
    x = int(input())

hh, mm = map(int, input().split())

snooze_count = 0
    while not func_1(hh, mm):
        snooze_count += 1
        
        mm -= x
        
        if mm < 0:
            mm += 60
            hh -= 1
            if hh < 0:
                hh += 24
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: hh is reduced by the total amount of minutes divided by x until it becomes 23, mm is reduced by the total amount of minutes modulo 60 until it is 59 or less, snooze_count is incremented by the number of iterations until the condition func_1(hh, mm) returns True, x remains unchanged.
    print(snooze_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer representing the snooze interval in minutes), `hh` (an integer representing the hour part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format), and `mm` (an integer representing the minute part of the wake-up time in 24-hour format). The function continuously decreases the `mm` value by `x` every iteration of the while loop until the time `hh:mm` contains the digit '7', as determined by the function `func_1(hh, mm)`. If the `mm` value goes below zero during the subtraction, it wraps around to the next minute. Similarly, if the `hh` value goes below zero, it wraps around to the next day. The function increments a counter `snooze_count` with each iteration of the loop. Once the condition in `func_1(hh, mm)` is met, the function prints the value of `snooze_count` and does not return anything. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `hh` and `mm` have been adjusted to the nearest valid time where `func_1(hh, mm)` returns True, and `snooze_count` reflects the number of iterations needed to reach this state.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7'. 

- **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the current time `h:m` contains the digit '7', which is used to determine if the current time is lucky.
- **Main Function `func_2`**: This function reads the inputs, initializes the snooze count, and iteratively reduces the minutes by `x` until the current time becomes lucky. It handles the transition from 00:00 to 23:59 correctly by adjusting hours and minutes accordingly.

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the time is adjusted properly when minutes go below zero and correctly increments the hour when necessary. Additionally, it stops once a lucky time is found, ensuring the smallest number of snoozes is returned. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
