### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of snoozes needed to reach a lucky time (containing the digit '7') starting from a given time \(hh:mm\), with snoozes occurring every \(x\) minutes.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly checks if a given time \(h:m\) contains the digit '7'.
   - It concatenates the hour and minute parts into strings and checks if '7' is present.
   - This function works correctly and is used appropriately in the main logic.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values for \(x\), \(hh\), and \(mm\).
   - It initializes the count of snoozes to zero.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current time is lucky using `func_1`.
   - If the time is not lucky, it decreases the minute value by \(x\) and handles the wrap-around for minutes and hours appropriately.
   - It increments the snooze count each time the time is not lucky.
   - Once a lucky time is reached, it prints the count of snoozes.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct, converting string inputs to integers.
   - The function correctly processes the 24-hour format and handles wrap-around conditions for hours and minutes.

5. **Time Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic for adjusting the time (minutes and hours) and handling the 24-hour format is correct.
   - The function ensures that the time is adjusted correctly until a lucky time is reached.

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to be logically sound and should work as expected for all valid inputs as per the problem statement. The function summaries align well with the actual implementation, confirming that the program behaves as intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of snoozes needed to reach a lucky time.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
