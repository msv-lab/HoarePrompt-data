Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis to confirm:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the current time `h:m` contains the digit '7'. This is essential for determining if the time is lucky.
   
2. **Main Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the inputs `x`, `hh`, and `mm` and initializes the `snooze_count`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `func_1(hh, mm)` returns `True`.
   - Inside the loop, it subtracts `x` from `mm` and adjusts `hh` and `mm` appropriately when `mm` goes below zero or `hh` goes below zero.
   - The loop increments `snooze_count` with each iteration, ensuring that the smallest number of snoozes is counted.

The function handles all edge cases correctly:
- When `mm` goes below zero, it wraps around to the next minute by adding 60 to `mm` and decrementing `hh`.
- When `hh` goes below zero, it wraps around to the next day by adding 24 to `hh`.

Given these observations, the function indeed finds the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7'. The provided examples also support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
