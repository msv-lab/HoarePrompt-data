Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number of times Jamie needs to press the snooze button until the time contains the digit '7'. 

- **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the current time `h:m` contains the digit '7', which is used to determine if the current time is lucky.
- **Main Function `func_2`**: This function reads the inputs, initializes the snooze count, and iteratively reduces the minutes by `x` until the current time becomes lucky. It handles the transition from 00:00 to 23:59 correctly by adjusting hours and minutes accordingly.

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the time is adjusted properly when minutes go below zero and correctly increments the hour when necessary. Additionally, it stops once a lucky time is found, ensuring the smallest number of snoozes is returned. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
