Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `half_n + 1` and `n` is greater than `half_n`.
3. **Update `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` will become `half_n + 2`.
4. **Check `n`**: Since `n` is greater than `half_n`, it does not change and still satisfies the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `half_n + 2`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains unchanged, `right_sum` is updated to `0` if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n + 1`**.
