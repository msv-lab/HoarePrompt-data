The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `half_n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `half_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `half_n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `half_n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `half_n` is greater than 0**
