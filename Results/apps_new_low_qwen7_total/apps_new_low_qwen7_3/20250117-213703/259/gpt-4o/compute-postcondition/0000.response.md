Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, half_n is n // 2, left_sum is 0, right_sum is 0, left_question_marks is 0, right_question_marks is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `half_n` by dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means `half_n` is exactly `n / 2`.
- The next three lines initialize `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_question_marks`, and `right_question_marks` to 0. These variables are used to keep track of the sum of digits and the count of question marks in the left and right halves of the string `ticket`, respectively. Since no operations are performed on these variables in the given code, they remain at their initialized values of 0.

The code block does not modify the value of `n` or the content of the string `ticket`, so these remain as specified in the initial state.
