The code snippet `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates `right_sum` by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially `half_n + 2`, and considering the precondition that `n` is greater than `half_n + 1`, it means that `i` is within the range of the list `ticket` and specifically refers to the element right after the `half_n + 1` index.

Since `right_sum` is updated by adding `int(ticket[i])` to its current value, and `i` is `half_n + 2`, the output state will reflect this change. The other variables (`i`, `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_question_marks`, `half_n`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `half_n + 2`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains unchanged, `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])` if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is not '?', otherwise it remains `0`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n + 1`.**
