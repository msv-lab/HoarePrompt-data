The code `right_question_marks += 1` increments the value of `right_question_marks` by 1. Based on the initial state, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `half_n + 2`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1, `right_sum` is updated to `0` if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n + 1`.**
