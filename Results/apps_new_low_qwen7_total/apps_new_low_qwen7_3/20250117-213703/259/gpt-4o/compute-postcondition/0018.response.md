The code increments `right_question_marks` by 1. Since `ticket[i]` is '?', this means that we are moving from the left side to the right side of the list and counting the number of '?' on the right side. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented to `half_n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is now `right_question_marks + 1`, `right_sum` remains 0, and `half_n` remains unchanged.**
