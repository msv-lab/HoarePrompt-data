`left_sum` is assigned the value of `left_sum + int(ticket[i])`. Since `i` is 1, `ticket[i]` refers to `ticket[1]`. The value of `half_n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1; `half_n` is greater than 0; `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `half_n` is greater than 0; `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[1]`**
