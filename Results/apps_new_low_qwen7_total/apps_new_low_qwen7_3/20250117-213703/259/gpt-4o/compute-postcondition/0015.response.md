Output State: **`i` is `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` remains 0, `right_sum` remains 0, and `half_n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`.
   - If `ticket[i]` is `'?'`, `left_question_marks` increments by 1.
   - If `ticket[i]` is not `'?'`, `left_sum` increments by the integer value of `ticket[i]`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `half_n - 1`.
   - `left_question_marks` increases by 1 each time `ticket[i]` is `'?'`.
   - `left_sum` increases by the integer value of `ticket[i]` each time `ticket[i]` is not `'?'`.
   - `half_n` is the initial integer value and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `left_question_marks` and `left_sum` are updated based on the values of `ticket`.
   - `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` remain 0 because they are not updated inside the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After `half_n` iterations, `i` will be `half_n - 1`.
   - `left_question_marks` will be the count of `'?'` in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`.
   - `left_sum` will be the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`.
   - `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` remain 0 because the loop only updates the left side.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final values of `i`, `left_question_marks`, and `left_sum` are consistent with the loop's behavior.
   - `half_n`, `right_question_marks`, and `right_sum` remain unchanged as expected.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed `half_n` times is as described above.
