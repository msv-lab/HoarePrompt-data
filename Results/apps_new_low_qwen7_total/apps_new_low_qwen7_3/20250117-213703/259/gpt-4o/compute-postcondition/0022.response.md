Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given code snippet are `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop runs from `half_n` to `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true. Given that `i` starts at `half_n` and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented to `half_n`.
   - `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`.
   - `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`.
   - If `ticket[i]` is '?', `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 and `right_sum` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, `right_question_marks` remains 0 and `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`.
   - `half_n` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is greater than `half_n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented to `half_n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `half_n + 1`.
   - `left_question_marks` and `left_sum` remain unchanged.
   - `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` will be checked based on the new value of `i` (which is now `half_n + 1`).
   - `half_n` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must still be greater than `half_n`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` is `half_n + 1`.
   - `left_question_marks` remains the same.
   - `left_sum` remains the same.
   - `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains 0.
   - `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])`.
   - `half_n` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must be greater than `half_n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is half_n + 1, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains 0, `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1]), `half_n` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than half_n**.
