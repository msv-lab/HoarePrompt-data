`left_question_marks` is assigned the value of `left_question_marks` plus 1. The value of `i` is 1, and the condition that `half_n` is greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `left_question_marks` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `half_n` is greater than 0, `left_question_marks` is 2**
