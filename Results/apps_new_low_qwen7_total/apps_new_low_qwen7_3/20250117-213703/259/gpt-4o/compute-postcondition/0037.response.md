The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. 

- `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the `ticket` is even.

Case_1: The function checks if the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even. If it is, the function returns a specific value (the exact value is not provided in the given information). If the number of '?' characters is not even, the function returns an error or a specific message indicating that the number of '?' characters is not even.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters, ensuring the number of '?' characters is even, and then return a specific value or an error message based on this condition.
