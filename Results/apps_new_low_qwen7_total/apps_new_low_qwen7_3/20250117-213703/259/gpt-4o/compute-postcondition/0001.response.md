Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Control Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` using `range(half_n)`.
   - The control variable here is `i`, and the loop will execute as long as `i < half_n`.

2. **Initial States Before the Loop:**
   - `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `half_n` is `n // 2`.
   - `left_sum` is 0.
   - `right_sum` is 0.
   - `left_question_marks` is 0.
   - `right_question_marks` is 0.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue as long as `i < half_n`.

4. **Initial Values for `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0.

5. **Value of `half_n`:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0, `half_n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all.
   - Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `half_n` will be at least 1 (since `n // 2` will be at least 1 when `n` is at least 2).

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` must be 0.
- `half_n` must be greater than 0.

Given that `half_n` is derived from `n` and `n` is an even integer, `half_n` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 0, `half_n` must be greater than 0**
