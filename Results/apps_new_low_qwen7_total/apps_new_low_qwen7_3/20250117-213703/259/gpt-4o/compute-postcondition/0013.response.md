The code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates `left_sum` by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 2, we need to know the value of `ticket[2]`. However, since the value of `ticket[2]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `left_sum`. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged variables and the updated `left_sum` which is the sum of its previous value and `int(ticket[2])`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `half_n` is greater than 0, `left_sum` is the original value of `left_sum` plus `int(ticket[2])`**
