`right_question_marks` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `left_question_marks + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is half_n + 1, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is left_question_marks + 1, `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1]), `half_n` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than half_n.
