Postcondition: **`i` is `half_n + 2`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains unchanged, `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])` if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is not '?', otherwise it remains `0`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n + 1`. If `ticket[i]` is '?', then `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1, `right_sum` is updated to `0` if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains unchanged. If `ticket[i]` is not '?', then `right_sum` is updated by adding the integer value of `ticket[i]` to its current value.**
