The code `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `right_sum` by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Since `ticket[i]` is not '?', it will be converted to its integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented to `half_n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` remains 0, `right_sum` is `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n`.**
