The code `left_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `left_sum` by the integer value of the ticket at index `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `half_n` is greater than 0, and the ticket at index `i` is not '?'. However, the initial value of `left_sum` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact new value. But we know that `left_sum` has been updated.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `half_n` is greater than 0, `left_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[0]`, and the ticket at index `i` is not '?'**
