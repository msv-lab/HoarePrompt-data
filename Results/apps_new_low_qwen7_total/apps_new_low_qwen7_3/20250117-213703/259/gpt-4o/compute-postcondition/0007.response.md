Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `half_n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < half_n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `half_n` is greater than 0.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues if `i < half_n`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `half_n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop body.

Given this information, we can adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1.
- `half_n` remains the same and is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `half_n` is greater than 0**
