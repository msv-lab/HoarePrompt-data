Output State: **i is n, left_question_marks is the total number of '?' in the first half_n elements of ticket, left_sum is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first half_n elements of ticket, right_question_marks is the total number of '?' in the elements from half_n to n-1 of ticket, right_sum is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the elements from half_n to n-1 of ticket, half_n remains unchanged, n is greater than half_n, diff is left_sum - right_sum, q_diff is left_question_marks - right_question_marks**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `diff` as the difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum`.
- The second line calculates `q_diff` as the difference between `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks`.

No other variables are affected by these lines of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_question_marks`, `right_sum`, `half_n`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
