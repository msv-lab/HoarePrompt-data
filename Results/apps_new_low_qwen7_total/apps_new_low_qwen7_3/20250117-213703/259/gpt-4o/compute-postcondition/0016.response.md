To determine the state of the objects at the start of the for loop, we need to focus on the loop's initialization and condition. The loop starts with `i = half_n - 1` and iterates over the range from `half_n` to `n-1`.

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute the first time:

1. **Variable `i`:** 
   - Initially, `i` is set to `half_n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be incremented to `half_n` (the start of the range).
   - Therefore, `i` must be incremented once before the loop starts.

2. **Variables `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `half_n`:**
   - These variables remain unchanged during the loop, as indicated in the problem statement.
   - The values of `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_question_marks`, `right_sum`, and `half_n` do not affect whether the loop can execute. They are simply part of the initial state and will be used within the loop body.

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - To enter the loop, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at `half_n - 1` and needs to be incremented to `half_n` to start the loop, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state required for the loop to execute the first time:

- `i` must be incremented to `half_n` before the loop starts.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is incremented to `half_n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` remains 0, `right_sum` remains 0, and `half_n` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `half_n`**.
