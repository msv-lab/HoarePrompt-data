The code `right_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `right_sum` by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Given that `i` is `half_n + 1`, the value added to `right_sum` is `int(ticket[half_n + 1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is `half_n + 1`
- `left_question_marks` remains the same
- `left_sum` remains the same
- `right_question_marks` remains the same (as `ticket[half_n + 1]` is not specified to be '?', so it does not increment)
- `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1])`
- `half_n` remains unchanged
- `n` is greater than `half_n`

Output State: **`i` is `half_n + 1`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first half_n elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it remains 0, `right_sum` is 0 if `ticket[half_n + 1]` is '?', otherwise it is updated to right_sum + int(ticket[half_n + 1]), `half_n` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `half_n`**
