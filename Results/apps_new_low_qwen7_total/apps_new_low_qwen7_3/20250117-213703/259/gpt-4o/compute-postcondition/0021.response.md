Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented to `half_n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`. If `ticket[i]` is '?', `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 and `right_sum` remains 0. Otherwise, `right_question_marks` remains 0 and `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`. `half_n` remains unchanged and `n` is greater than `half_n`.***
