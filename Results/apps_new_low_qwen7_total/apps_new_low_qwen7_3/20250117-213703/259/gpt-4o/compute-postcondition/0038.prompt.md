You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and ticket is a string of length n consisting of digits and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the ticket is even.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2

left_sum = 0

right_sum = 0

left_question_marks = 0

right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `half_n - 1`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` remains 0, `right_sum` remains 0, and `half_n` remains unchanged.
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n`
    diff = left_sum - right_sum

q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if ((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0) :
        print('Bicarp')
    else :
        print('Monocarp')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is `n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `half_n` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `half_n`, `diff` is `left_sum - right_sum`, `q_diff` is `left_question_marks - right_question_marks`. If `((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0)`, the function prints 'Bicarp'. Otherwise, nothing specific changes in the variables and the program continues with the same conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. 
#
#- `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
#- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in the `ticket` is even.
#
#Case_1: The function checks if the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even. If it is, the function returns a specific value (the exact value is not provided in the given information). If the number of '?' characters is not even, the function returns an error or a specific message indicating that the number of '?' characters is not even.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an even integer `n` and a string `ticket` of length `n` containing digits and '?' characters, ensuring the number of '?' characters is even, and then return a specific value or an error message based on this condition.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
