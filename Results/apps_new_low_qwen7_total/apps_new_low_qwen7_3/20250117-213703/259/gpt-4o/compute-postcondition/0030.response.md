Output State: **`i` is `n`, `left_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `left_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first `half_n` elements of `ticket`, `right_question_marks` is the total number of '?' in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `right_sum` is the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the elements from `half_n` to `n-1` of `ticket`, `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `half_n`**.

### Analysis:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop starts with `i = half_n - 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`.
   - During each iteration, if `ticket[i]` is '?', `right_question_marks` is incremented by 1 and `right_sum` remains 0. Otherwise, `right_sum` is updated to `right_sum + int(ticket[i])`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `half_n` remains unchanged, and `n` must always be greater than `half_n` for the loop to start.
   - **Variables that Change**: 
     - `i`: Starts at `half_n - 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
     - `left_question_marks`: Remains constant as it is only evaluated at the start.
     - `left_sum`: Remains constant as it is only evaluated at the start.
     - `right_question_marks`: Increases by 1 for each '?' encountered from `half_n` to `n-1`.
     - `right_sum`: Updates with the integer value of `ticket[i]` for each non-'?' element from `half_n` to `n-1`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`. Once `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates.
   - By the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - `left_question_marks` and `left_sum` do not change throughout the loop.
   - `right_question_marks` will be the count of '?' from `half_n` to `n-1`.
   - `right_sum` will be the sum of the integer values of non-'?' elements from `half_n` to `n-1`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. Specifically, the loop correctly updates `right_question_marks` and `right_sum` based on the values in `ticket` from `half_n` to `n-1`.

Thus, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, and the values of `left_question_marks`, `left_sum`, `right_question_marks`, and `right_sum` will reflect the counts and sums from the specified segments of `ticket`.
