You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

If `((diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0)`, the function prints 'Bicarp'. Otherwise, nothing specific changes in the variables and the program continues with the same conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. 

- `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even.

The function calculates the sum of non-'?' characters in the first half and second half of the `ticket` string and counts the number of '?' characters in each half. It then computes the difference between these sums and the difference in the count of '?' characters. Based on these calculations, the function determines whether the ticket can be considered "Bicarp" or "Monocarp". Specifically, if the adjusted sum difference (considering the maximum possible value for '?' characters as 9) is divisible by 9, the function prints 'Bicarp'; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is always even, as stated in the problem constraints. There is no check to verify this condition, which means the function will only proceed correctly under this assumption. If the number of '?' characters were odd, the function would need to handle this case differently, potentially returning an error or a specific message indicating the inconsistency.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The variables `left_sum` and `right_sum` will hold the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first and second halves of `ticket`, respectively.
- The variables `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks` will hold the count of '?' characters in the first and second halves of `ticket`, respectively.
- The variables `half_n` and `n` will retain their original values.
- The function will print either 'Bicarp' or 'Monocarp' based on the computed conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the ticket has an odd number of digits, although the problem specifies that \( n \) is an even number. The program calculates `half_n` as \( \frac{n}{2} \), but it does not check if \( n \) is indeed even. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input does not meet the specified conditions. Additionally, the logic to determine the winner is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game where players take turns replacing digits to make the ticket happy. The current logic only checks the difference between the sums of the two halves and the number of question marks, which is insufficient to determine the winner in all scenarios.
