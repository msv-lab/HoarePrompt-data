You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of $n$ digits ($n$ is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. The number of digits that have been erased is even.

Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first $\frac{n}{2}$ digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last $\frac{n}{2}$ digits.

Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from $0$ to $9$. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.

If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one even integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains a string of $n$ digits and "?" characters — the ticket which Monocarp and Bicarp have found. If the $i$-th character is "?", then the $i$-th digit is erased. Note that there may be leading zeroes. The number of "?" characters is even.


-----Output-----

If Monocarp wins, print "Monocarp" (without quotes). Otherwise print "Bicarp" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
0523

Output
Bicarp

Input
2
??

Output
Bicarp

Input
8
?054??0?

Output
Bicarp

Input
6
???00?

Output
Monocarp



-----Note-----

Since there is no question mark in the ticket in the first example, the winner is determined before the game even starts, and it is Bicarp.

In the second example, Bicarp also wins. After Monocarp chooses an erased digit and replaces it with a new one, Bicap can choose another position with an erased digit and replace it with the same digit, so the ticket is happy.

- Program:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
func_1(n, ticket)

def func_1(n, ticket):
    half_n = n // 2
    left_sum = 0
    right_sum = 0
    left_question_marks = 0
    right_question_marks = 0
    for i in range(half_n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            left_question_marks += 1
        else:
            left_sum += int(ticket[i])
    for i in range(half_n, n):
        if ticket[i] == '?':
            right_question_marks += 1
        else:
            right_sum += int(ticket[i])
    diff = left_sum - right_sum
    q_diff = left_question_marks - right_question_marks
    if (diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0:
        print('Bicarp')
    else:
        print('Monocarp')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. 

- `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `ticket` is a string of length `n` consisting of digits and '?' characters. The number of '?' characters in `ticket` is even.

The function calculates the sum of non-'?' characters in the first half and second half of the `ticket` string and counts the number of '?' characters in each half. It then computes the difference between these sums and the difference in the count of '?' characters. Based on these calculations, the function determines whether the ticket can be considered "Bicarp" or "Monocarp". Specifically, if the adjusted sum difference (considering the maximum possible value for '?' characters as 9) is divisible by 9, the function prints 'Bicarp'; otherwise, it prints 'Monocarp'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the number of '?' characters in `ticket` is always even, as stated in the problem constraints. There is no check to verify this condition, which means the function will only proceed correctly under this assumption. If the number of '?' characters were odd, the function would need to handle this case differently, potentially returning an error or a specific message indicating the inconsistency.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The variables `left_sum` and `right_sum` will hold the sum of the integer values of the non-'?' elements in the first and second halves of `ticket`, respectively.
- The variables `left_question_marks` and `right_question_marks` will hold the count of '?' characters in the first and second halves of `ticket`, respectively.
- The variables `half_n` and `n` will retain their original values.
- The function will print either 'Bicarp' or 'Monocarp' based on the computed conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to verify if it correctly determines the winner based on the rules and conditions specified. Let's break down the logic and check its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program reads the number of digits \( n \) and the ticket string.
   - It calculates the midpoint `half_n` of the ticket.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - It iterates through the first half of the ticket to calculate the sum of non-question-mark digits (`left_sum`) and counts the number of question marks (`left_question_marks`).
   - Similarly, it does the same for the second half of the ticket (`right_sum` and `right_question_marks`).

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - It calculates the difference between the sums of the two halves (`diff`).
   - It calculates the difference between the number of question marks in the two halves (`q_diff`).

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0`. This condition is derived from the fact that replacing question marks with any digit from 0 to 9 can change the sum of the digits by multiples of 9. If this condition is met, Bicarp can make the ticket happy; otherwise, Monocarp can prevent Bicarp from doing so.

Given this breakdown, let's verify the logic:
- If the calculated condition holds true, it means Bicarp can always make the ticket happy, so Bicarp wins.
- If the condition is not met, Monocarp can always prevent Bicarp from making the ticket happy, so Monocarp wins.

Upon review, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic and accurately determine the winner based on the given rules.
