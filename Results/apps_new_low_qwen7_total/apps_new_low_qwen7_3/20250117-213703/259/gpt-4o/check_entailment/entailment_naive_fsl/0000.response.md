Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the ticket has an odd number of digits, although the problem specifies that \( n \) is an even number. The program calculates `half_n` as \( \frac{n}{2} \), but it does not check if \( n \) is indeed even. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input does not meet the specified conditions. Additionally, the logic to determine the winner is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game where players take turns replacing digits to make the ticket happy. The current logic only checks the difference between the sums of the two halves and the number of question marks, which is insufficient to determine the winner in all scenarios.
