Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-'?' digits in the first half and the second half of the ticket string.
2. It also counts the number of '?' characters in each half.
3. The logic to determine the winner is based on the difference between these sums and the difference in the count of '?' characters, considering the maximum possible value for '?' characters as 9.
4. The condition `(diff + q_diff // 2 * 9) % 9 == 0` checks if the adjusted sum difference can be made divisible by 9, which would make the ticket happy. This is the core logic to decide the winner.
5. The function handles the given constraints and examples correctly.
6. Although the function does not explicitly check if the number of '?' characters is even, it implicitly relies on this assumption because the problem statement guarantees it.

Given these points, the function logic appears to be sound and should work as intended for the given problem constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
