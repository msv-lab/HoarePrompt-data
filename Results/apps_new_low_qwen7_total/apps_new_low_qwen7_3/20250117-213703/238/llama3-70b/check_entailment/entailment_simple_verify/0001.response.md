### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` which reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), Frodo is on the first bed.
   - The program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} \): This represents the equal distribution of pillows among all hobbits.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - 1) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to one more pillow than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while still having at least one more pillow than the last hobbit.
   - This calculation is correct because if \( k = 1 \), Frodo can have \( \text{m} // \text{n} \) pillows plus one more to ensure he has at least one more pillow than the last hobbit.

3. **General Case for \( k > 1 \)**:
   - For any other position \( k \), the program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} + 1 \): This represents the equal distribution plus one additional pillow for Frodo.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while ensuring no hobbit is hurt.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic here. The value \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \) should be interpreted differently. It means that Frodo can have \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution, and the remaining pillows are distributed to the other hobbits. This should be \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \leq (m // n + (k-1)) \).

Let's re-examine the examples with this corrected understanding:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 4 \), \( m = 6 \), \( k = 2 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 6 // 4 = 1 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(1 + 1, 6 - (4 - 2)) = \min(2, 4) = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2 (This is correct)

- **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 10 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 10 // 3 = 3 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(3 + 1, 10 - (3 - 3)) = \min(4, 10) = 4 \)
  - Correct output: 4 (This is correct)

- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 6 // 3 = 2 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(2, 6 - (3 - 1)) = \min(2, 4) = 3 \)
  - Correct output: 3 (This is correct)

However, let's consider another example to further validate the logic:

- **Example 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 7 // 5 = 1 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(1 + 1, 7 - (5 - 3)) = \min(2, 5) = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2 (This is incorrect based on the problem constraints)

Based on this analysis, the logic in the program for the general case is flawed. Specifically, the value \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \) should be interpreted as ensuring Frodo has \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.
