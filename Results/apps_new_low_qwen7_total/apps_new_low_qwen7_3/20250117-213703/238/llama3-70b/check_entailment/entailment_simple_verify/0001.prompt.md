You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n hobbits are planning to spend the night at Frodo's house. Frodo has n beds standing in a row and m pillows (n ≤ m). Each hobbit needs a bed and at least one pillow to sleep, however, everyone wants as many pillows as possible. Of course, it's not always possible to share pillows equally, but any hobbit gets hurt if he has at least two pillows less than some of his neighbors have. 

Frodo will sleep on the k-th bed in the row. What is the maximum number of pillows he can have so that every hobbit has at least one pillow, every pillow is given to some hobbit and no one is hurt?


-----Input-----

The only line contain three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hobbits, the number of pillows and the number of Frodo's bed.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have so that no one is hurt.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 6 2

Output
2

Input
3 10 3

Output
4

Input
3 6 1

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example Frodo can have at most two pillows. In this case, he can give two pillows to the hobbit on the first bed, and one pillow to each of the hobbits on the third and the fourth beds.

In the second example Frodo can take at most four pillows, giving three pillows to each of the others.

In the third example Frodo can take three pillows, giving two pillows to the hobbit in the middle and one pillow to the hobbit on the third bed.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else:
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k == 1) :
        print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
    else :
        print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. If `k` equals 1, the printed value is `min(m // n, m - (n - 1))`. If `k` does not equal 1, the printed value is `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` which reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), Frodo is on the first bed.
   - The program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} \): This represents the equal distribution of pillows among all hobbits.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - 1) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to one more pillow than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while still having at least one more pillow than the last hobbit.
   
3. **General Case for \( k > 1 \)**:
   - For any other position \( k \), the program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} + 1 \): This represents the equal distribution plus one additional pillow for Frodo.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while ensuring no hobbit is hurt.

Given these calculations, let's verify the examples provided:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 4 \), \( m = 6 \), \( k = 2 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 6 // 4 = 1 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(1 + 1, 6 - (4 - 2)) = \min(2, 4) = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2

- **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 10 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 10 // 3 = 3 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(3 + 1, 10 - (3 - 3)) = \min(4, 10) = 4 \)
  - Correct output: 4

- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 6 // 3 = 2 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(2, 6 - (3 - 1)) = \min(2, 4) = 3 \)
  - Correct output: 3

The logic in the program correctly handles both special and general cases, ensuring that Frodo can have the maximum number of pillows without hurting any other hobbit.

The given program is correct according to the problem statement and examples provided.
