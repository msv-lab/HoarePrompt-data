### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires distributing \(m\) pillows among \(n\) hobbits such that each hobbit gets at least one pillow, and no hobbit feels "hurt," meaning no hobbit has at least two fewer pillows than any of their neighbors.
   - Frodo is placed on the \(k\)-th bed and we need to find the maximum number of pillows he can have under these constraints.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - If Frodo has more pillows than his neighbors, his neighbors must be able to distribute their pillows to avoid being "hurt."
   - If \(k = 1\), Frodo cannot have more pillows than the hobbit on the second bed.
   - For other positions, the distribution logic changes slightly due to the positioning.

3. **Given Code**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case when \(k = 1\) by checking if Frodo can have at most \(\min(m // n, m - (n - 1))\) pillows.
   - For other positions (\(k > 1\)), it checks if Frodo can have at most \(\min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))\) pillows.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \(k = 1\):
     - If \(m // n < m - (n - 1)\), Frodo can have up to \(m // n\) pillows.
     - Otherwise, Frodo can have up to \(m - (n - 1)\) pillows.
   - When \(k > 1\):
     - If \(m // n + 1 < m - (n - k)\), Frodo can have up to \(m // n + 1\) pillows.
     - Otherwise, Frodo can have up to \(m - (n - k)\) pillows.

5. **Verification**:
   - The conditions and calculations in the given code correctly implement the logic for both edge cases and general cases.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
