### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())` which reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), Frodo is on the first bed.
   - The program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} \): This represents the equal distribution of pillows among all hobbits.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - 1) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to one more pillow than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while still having at least one more pillow than the last hobbit.
   - This part of the logic is correct because it ensures that Frodo has the maximum possible pillows without hurting any other hobbit.

3. **General Case for \( k > 1 \)**:
   - For any other position \( k \), the program calculates the minimum of two values:
     - \( \text{m} // \text{n} + 1 \): This represents the equal distribution plus one additional pillow for Frodo.
     - \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \): This ensures that Frodo can have up to \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution, allowing him to give the rest of the pillows to other hobbits while ensuring no hobbit is hurt.
   - However, the formula \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \) is incorrect. This formula subtracts the difference between the total number of hobbits and the position of Frodo from the total number of pillows. This does not correctly represent the scenario where Frodo should have \( k-1 \) more pillows than the equal distribution.

To illustrate why the formula \( \text{m} - (\text{n} - k) \) is incorrect, consider the following counterexample:

- **Counterexample**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 7 \), \( k = 2 \)
  - Equal distribution: \( 7 // 3 = 2 \)
  - Frodo's pillows: \( \min(2 + 1, 7 - (3 - 2)) = \min(3, 6) = 3 \)
  - Correct calculation: Frodo should have 3 pillows, and the remaining pillows should be distributed as 3, 1, and 3 (2+1, 1, 3-1).

Using the correct formula, the correct value for Frodo's pillows should be:
\[ \min(2 + 1, 2 + (2 - 1)) = \min(3, 3) = 3 \]

Therefore, the program is not handling the general case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is not correct according to the problem statement and examples provided.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
