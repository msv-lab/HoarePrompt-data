Reasoning:
1. The function reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the standard input.
2. It correctly handles the case when \( k = 1 \):
   - The expression `min(m // n, m - (n - 1))` ensures that Frodo gets at most \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{n} \right\rfloor \) pillows, and if this value is too large, it reduces it by distributing the remaining pillows among the other hobbits.
3. For the case when \( k \neq 1 \):
   - The expression `min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k))` ensures that Frodo gets one more pillow than the average per hobbit (\( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 \)), and adjusts the total pillows available for the remaining hobbits.
4. Both expressions respect the condition that no hobbit should have at least two fewer pillows than any of their neighbors.

Given the provided examples and the logic of the solution, the program appears to be handling the problem statement correctly without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
