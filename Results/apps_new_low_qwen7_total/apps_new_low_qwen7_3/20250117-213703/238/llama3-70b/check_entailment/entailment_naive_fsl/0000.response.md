Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the distribution of pillows needs to be adjusted based on the position of Frodo's bed. Specifically, the program does not correctly ensure that no hobbit ends up with at least two fewer pillows than a neighboring hobbit. 

For example, consider the input `4 6 4`. According to the problem description, Frodo is on the 4th bed. The correct solution would be to give 2 pillows to Frodo and distribute the remaining 4 pillows such that no hobbit has at least two fewer pillows than a neighbor. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
