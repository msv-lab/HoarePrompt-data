The code prints the minimum value between `m // n + 1` and `m - (n - k)`. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are inputs, their specific values are not known. However, `k` is not equal to 1.

Let's denote the value of `m // n + 1` as `a` and the value of `m - (n - k)` as `b`.

- `a = m // n + 1`
- `b = m - (n - k)`

The code will print the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not equal to 1, the output is min(`m // n + 1`, `m - (n - k)`)**
