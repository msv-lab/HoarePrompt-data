The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are given as integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), after executing the code, these values will be replaced by the integers inputted by the user. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
