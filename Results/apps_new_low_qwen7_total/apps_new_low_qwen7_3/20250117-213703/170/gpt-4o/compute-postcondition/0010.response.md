Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the value of `n // a` is printed. Otherwise, if `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.***
