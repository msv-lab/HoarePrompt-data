Output State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, k is an integer, remaining_rubles is an integer**

Explanation:
1. The line `k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1` calculates the integer division of `(n - b)` by `(b - c)` and then adds 1 to the result. This value is assigned to `k`.
2. The line `remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `(b - c)` using the previously calculated `k` and assigns this value to `remaining_rubles`.

Since the initial values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change, they remain as specified in the initial state. The new variables `k` and `remaining_rubles` are introduced and their values are determined based on the given expressions. Therefore, the output state includes these new variables along with the unchanged ones.
