The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.

Case_1: If `n` is less than `a` (the cost of one plastic liter bottle) and `n` is also less than `b` (the cost of one glass liter bottle), the function returns the minimum number of liters Kolya can buy, which would be 0 since he cannot afford any bottles.

Case_2: The function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy by considering both plastic and glass bottles, including the money he gets back from returning empty glass bottles. It returns the total number of liters he can purchase.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and return the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy given his rubles and the costs and refund rates of the bottles.
