The code snippet `print(n // a)` performs integer division of `n` by `a` and prints the result. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only outputs the result. Therefore, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values, and the precondition that `a` is less than or equal to `b - c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and the value of `a` is less than or equal to the value of `b - c`. The result of `n // a` is printed.**
