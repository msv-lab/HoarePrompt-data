The code prints the value of `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Since `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, no changes are made to `remaining_rubles` itself. The values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as well. The output of the print statement will be the sum of `k` and the integer division of `remaining_rubles` by `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `remaining_rubles` is an integer and the current value of `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`; the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`.**
