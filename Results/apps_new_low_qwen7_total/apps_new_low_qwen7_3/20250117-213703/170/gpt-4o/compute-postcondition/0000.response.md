Output State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer**
```

Explanation:
The code block takes four inputs from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. These variables are updated with the new values from the input, but the initial state's description remains valid as no further operations modify the values of these variables. Thus, the final state includes the updated types and values of these variables as they were assigned by the input.
