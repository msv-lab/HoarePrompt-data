The code prints the value of `k + 1`. Since the values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `remaining_rubles`) are not affected by the code, they remain unchanged. The only change is the print statement which outputs `k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `remaining_rubles` is an integer, and print statement outputs `k + 1`**
