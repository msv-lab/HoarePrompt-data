Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, and `remaining_rubles` are integers. If `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the value of `n // a` is printed. Otherwise, if `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively. The function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy using both plastic and glass bottles, taking into account the refund for glass bottles.

If `a` is greater than `b - c`, the function calculates the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly (`n // a`). If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy by first determining how many full sets of glass bottles and refunds he can use (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`). Then, it calculates the remaining rubles after buying these sets of glass bottles (`remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)`). If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (`remaining_rubles < b`), the function returns the total number of liters Kolya can buy as `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the function returns `k + 1`.

This function handles the case where Kolya might have enough remaining rubles to buy one more plastic bottle after using the refund from the last glass bottle. The function considers all possible scenarios and provides the maximum number of liters Kolya can purchase given his rubles and the costs and refund rates of the bottles.
