Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Kolya buys a glass bottle, drinks the kefir, returns the bottle, and then uses the refunded money along with his remaining rubles to buy another glass bottle. This is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not account for.

For example, consider the following input:
```
17
11
9
8
```
- Kolya starts with 17 rubles.
- He buys one glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 8 rubles.
- He returns the glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 16 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 7 rubles.
- He returns the second glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 15 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 6 rubles.
- He returns the third glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 14 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 5 rubles.
- He returns the fourth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 13 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 4 rubles.
- He returns the fifth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 12 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 3 rubles.
- He returns the sixth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 11 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 2 rubles.
- He returns the seventh glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 10 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 1 ruble.
- He cannot buy another glass bottle with the remaining 1 ruble.

Thus, Kolya can drink a total of 7 liters of kefir. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 2 liters. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.
