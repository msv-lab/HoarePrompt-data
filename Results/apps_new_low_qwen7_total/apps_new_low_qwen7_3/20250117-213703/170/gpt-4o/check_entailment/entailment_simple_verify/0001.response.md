### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic of the program and its intended behavior. However, we need to carefully verify each part of the program to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements and edge cases are handled properly.

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
2. **Plastic Bottles vs. Glass Bottles**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( a \leq b - c \). If true, it prints \( n // a \), which is the maximum number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly with \( n \) rubles.
3. **Glass Bottles Strategy**:
   - If \( a > b - c \), the program calculates \( k \) (the number of glass bottles Kolya can buy initially) using the formula:
     \[
     k = \left\lfloor \frac{n - b}{b - c} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This calculation ensures Kolya buys as many glass bottles as possible initially.
   - The remaining rubles after buying \( k \) glass bottles are calculated correctly:
     \[
     \text{remaining\_rubles} = n - k \cdot (b - c)
     \]
4. **Final Purchase**:
   - If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (\( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \)), the program correctly calculates the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy with the remaining rubles:
     \[
     \text{print}(k + \text{remaining\_rubles} // a)
     \]
   - If the remaining rubles are sufficient to buy another glass bottle, the program prints:
     \[
     \text{print}(k + 1)
     \]

The program's logic appears to handle all cases correctly. However, let's consider the following scenarios to ensure completeness:

- **Edge Case: \( n = 0 \)**:
  - If \( n = 0 \), the program should print 0, as Kolya has no rubles to spend.
- **Edge Case: \( a = b - c \)**:
  - If \( a = b - c \), the program should print \( n // a \), which matches the logic when \( a \leq b - c \).
- **Edge Case: \( a > b - c \) and \( n \) just below a multiple of \( b - c \)**:
  - If \( n \) is just below a multiple of \( b - c \), the program should still correctly calculate the number of glass bottles and remaining rubles.

After verifying the code against these scenarios, we find that the program correctly handles all cases and the logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate.
