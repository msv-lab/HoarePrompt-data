You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, and `remaining_rubles` are integers. If `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the value of `n // a` is printed. Otherwise, if `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Kolya buys a glass bottle, drinks the kefir, returns the bottle, and then uses the refunded money along with his remaining rubles to buy another glass bottle. This is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not account for.

For example, consider the following input:
```
17
11
9
8
```
- Kolya starts with 17 rubles.
- He buys one glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 8 rubles.
- He returns the glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 16 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 7 rubles.
- He returns the second glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 15 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 6 rubles.
- He returns the third glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 14 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 5 rubles.
- He returns the fourth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 13 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 4 rubles.
- He returns the fifth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 12 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 3 rubles.
- He returns the sixth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 11 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 2 rubles.
- He returns the seventh glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 10 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 1 ruble.
- He cannot buy another glass bottle with the remaining 1 ruble.

Thus, Kolya can drink a total of 7 liters of kefir. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 2 liters. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.
