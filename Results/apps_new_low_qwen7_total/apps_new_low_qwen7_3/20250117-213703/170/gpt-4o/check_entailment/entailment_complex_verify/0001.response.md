### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's re-evaluate the logic and ensure that it accurately solves the problem according to the given constraints and examples.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the input values \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
   - \( n \) is the number of rubles Kolya has.
   - \( a \) is the cost of a plastic bottle.
   - \( b \) is the cost of a glass bottle.
   - \( c \) is the refund for returning a glass bottle (\( c < b \)).

2. **Plastic Bottles vs. Glass Bottles**:
   - If \( a \leq b - c \), it is indeed more efficient to buy plastic bottles because each plastic bottle costs less than the effective cost of a glass bottle minus the refund.
   - If \( a > b - c \), buying glass bottles first and using the refund to buy more bottles is more beneficial.

3. **Calculation Steps**:
   - **Initial Purchase of Glass Bottles**:
     - Calculate how many glass bottles Kolya can buy initially:
       \[
       k = \left\lfloor \frac{n - b}{b - c} \right\rfloor + 1
       \]
     - This ensures Kolya buys as many glass bottles as possible, getting the maximum refund.
   - **Remaining Rubles**:
     - After buying \( k \) glass bottles, calculate the remaining rubles:
       \[
       \text{remaining\_rubles} = n - k \cdot (b - c)
       \]
   - **Final Purchase**:
     - If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (\( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \)), Kolya should buy plastic bottles with the remaining rubles.
     - Otherwise, Kolya can buy one more glass bottle and use the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles.

Now, let's check the annotated code and the implementation:

- **Initial Purchase Check**:
  ```python
  if a <= b - c:
      print(n // a)
  ```
  This part of the code is correct. If \( a \leq b - c \), Kolya should only buy plastic bottles.

- **Glass Bottles Strategy**:
  ```python
  else:
      k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
      remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
  ```
  Here, the calculation of \( k \) and the remaining rubles is correct. \( k \) represents the number of full sets of glass bottles and refunds Kolya can buy, and \( \text{remaining\_rubles} \) represents the leftover rubles after these purchases.

- **Final Purchase**:
  ```python
  if remaining_rubles < b:
      print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
  else:
      print(k + 1)
  ```
  - If \( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \), Kolya uses the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles.
  - Otherwise, Kolya buys one more glass bottle and uses the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles, resulting in \( k + 1 \).

The annotated code and the provided solution handle all scenarios correctly. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink, considering both plastic and glass bottles and their respective costs and refunds.

**Correctness: True**

### Final:
**True**
