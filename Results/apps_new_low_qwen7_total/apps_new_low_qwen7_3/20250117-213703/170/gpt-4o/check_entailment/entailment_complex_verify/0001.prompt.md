You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and a, b, and c are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

c = int(input())
    if (a <= b - c) :
        print(n // a)
    else :
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1

remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if (remaining_rubles < b) :
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else :
            print(k + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, and `remaining_rubles` are integers. If `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the value of `n // a` is printed. Otherwise, if `remaining_rubles` is less than `b`, the output of the print statement is `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the output of the print statement is `k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively. The function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy using both plastic and glass bottles, taking into account the refund for glass bottles.

If `a` is greater than `b - c`, the function calculates the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly (`n // a`). If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy by first determining how many full sets of glass bottles and refunds he can use (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`). Then, it calculates the remaining rubles after buying these sets of glass bottles (`remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)`). If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (`remaining_rubles < b`), the function returns the total number of liters Kolya can buy as `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the function returns `k + 1`.

This function handles the case where Kolya might have enough remaining rubles to buy one more plastic bottle after using the refund from the last glass bottle. The function considers all possible scenarios and provides the maximum number of liters Kolya can purchase given his rubles and the costs and refund rates of the bottles.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic step-by-step and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the input values \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
   - \( n \) is the number of rubles Kolya has.
   - \( a \) is the cost of a plastic bottle.
   - \( b \) is the cost of a glass bottle.
   - \( c \) is the refund for returning a glass bottle (\( c < b \)).

2. **Plastic Bottles vs. Glass Bottles**:
   - If the cost of a plastic bottle \( a \) is less than or equal to the cost difference between a glass bottle and its refund \( b - c \), it's more efficient to use plastic bottles because:
     \[
     \text{Effective cost of a glass bottle} = b - c
     \]
     Since \( a \leq b - c \), Kolya should only buy plastic bottles initially.

3. **Glass Bottles Strategy**:
   - If \( a > b - c \), Kolya should buy a glass bottle and get \( c \) rubles back, which he can use to buy more bottles (either plastic or glass).

4. **Calculation Steps**:
   - **Initial Purchase of Glass Bottles**: Calculate how many glass bottles Kolya can buy initially with \( n \) rubles:
     \[
     k = \left\lfloor \frac{n - b}{b - c} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - **Remaining Rubles**: After buying \( k \) glass bottles, calculate the remaining rubles:
     \[
     \text{remaining\_rubles} = n - k \cdot (b - c)
     \]
   - **Final Purchase**:
     - If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (\( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \)), Kolya should buy plastic bottles with the remaining rubles.
     - Otherwise, Kolya can buy one more glass bottle and use the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles.

Let's analyze the provided solution against these steps:

- The program checks if \( a \leq b - c \) and prints \( n // a \) if true.
- If \( a > b - c \), the program calculates \( k \) and the remaining rubles correctly.
- It handles the remaining rubles appropriately to maximize the number of bottles.

Given the detailed logic and the code implementation, the program correctly addresses the problem requirements and handles all edge cases properly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink.
