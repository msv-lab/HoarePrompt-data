### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic step-by-step and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the input values \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
   - \( n \) is the number of rubles Kolya has.
   - \( a \) is the cost of a plastic bottle.
   - \( b \) is the cost of a glass bottle.
   - \( c \) is the refund for returning a glass bottle (\( c < b \)).

2. **Plastic Bottles vs. Glass Bottles**:
   - If the cost of a plastic bottle \( a \) is less than or equal to the cost difference between a glass bottle and its refund \( b - c \), it's more efficient to use plastic bottles because:
     \[
     \text{Effective cost of a glass bottle} = b - c
     \]
     Since \( a \leq b - c \), Kolya should only buy plastic bottles initially.

3. **Glass Bottles Strategy**:
   - If \( a > b - c \), Kolya should buy a glass bottle and get \( c \) rubles back, which he can use to buy more bottles (either plastic or glass).

4. **Calculation Steps**:
   - **Initial Purchase of Glass Bottles**: Calculate how many glass bottles Kolya can buy initially with \( n \) rubles:
     \[
     k = \left\lfloor \frac{n - b}{b - c} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - **Remaining Rubles**: After buying \( k \) glass bottles, calculate the remaining rubles:
     \[
     \text{remaining\_rubles} = n - k \cdot (b - c)
     \]
   - **Final Purchase**:
     - If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (\( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \)), Kolya should buy plastic bottles with the remaining rubles.
     - Otherwise, Kolya can buy one more glass bottle and use the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles.

Let's analyze the provided solution against these steps:

- The program checks if \( a \leq b - c \) and prints \( n // a \) if true.
- If \( a > b - c \), the program calculates \( k \) and the remaining rubles correctly.
- It handles the remaining rubles appropriately to maximize the number of bottles.

Given the detailed logic and the code implementation, the program correctly addresses the problem requirements and handles all edge cases properly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink.

**Correctness: True**
