### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to ensure the logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - Kolya has \( n \) rubles.
   - Plastic bottle costs \( a \) rubles.
   - Glass bottle costs \( b \) rubles.
   - Refund for returning a glass bottle is \( c \) rubles.
   - Kolya wants to maximize the number of liters of kefir he can drink.

2. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function `func` takes four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calculates the maximum number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink by considering both plastic and glass bottles and their respective costs and refunds.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first checks if \( a \leq b - c \). If true, it directly calculates the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy and prints it.
   - If \( a > b - c \), it calculates the number of full sets of glass bottles and refunds Kolya can use (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`).
   - It then calculates the remaining rubles after buying these sets of glass bottles.
   - Depending on the remaining rubles, it decides whether to buy additional plastic bottles or one more glass bottle.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Case 1: \( a \leq b - c \)**:
     - The logic is straightforward: Kolya can only buy plastic bottles, so the number of liters is \( n // a \).
   - **Case 2: \( a > b - c \)**:
     - The calculation for `k` is correct: \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{n - b}{b - c} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
     - The remaining rubles after buying \( k \) glass bottles is \( \text{remaining\_rubles} = n - k \cdot (b - c) \).
     - The program correctly handles the remaining rubles:
       - If \( \text{remaining\_rubles} < b \), Kolya buys plastic bottles with the remaining rubles: \( k + \text{remaining\_rubles} // a \).
       - Otherwise, Kolya buys one more glass bottle and uses the remaining rubles to buy plastic bottles: \( k + 1 \).

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly handles all scenarios and ensures Kolya maximizes the number of liters of kefir he can drink.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of liters of kefir Kolya can drink.

**Final: True**
