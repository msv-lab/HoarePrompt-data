You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the details of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he found himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.

Kolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy kefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter bottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c (c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles.

Kolya has n rubles and he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There were no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act optimally and asks for your help.


-----Input-----

First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning.

Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
11
9
8

Output
2

Input
10
5
6
1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir.

In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    if a <= b - c:
        print(n // a)
    else:
        k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1
        remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)
        if remaining_rubles < b:
            print(k + remaining_rubles // a)
        else:
            print(k + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of rubles Kolya has, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers representing the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle, and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively. The function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy using both plastic and glass bottles, taking into account the refund for glass bottles.

If `a` is greater than `b - c`, the function calculates the number of plastic bottles Kolya can buy directly (`n // a`). If `a` is less than or equal to `b - c`, the function calculates the maximum number of liters Kolya can buy by first determining how many full sets of glass bottles and refunds he can use (`k = (n - b) // (b - c) + 1`). Then, it calculates the remaining rubles after buying these sets of glass bottles (`remaining_rubles = n - k * (b - c)`). If the remaining rubles are not enough to buy another glass bottle (`remaining_rubles < b`), the function returns the total number of liters Kolya can buy as `k + remaining_rubles // a`. Otherwise, the function returns `k + 1`.

This function handles the case where Kolya might have enough remaining rubles to buy one more plastic bottle after using the refund from the last glass bottle. The function considers all possible scenarios and provides the maximum number of liters Kolya can purchase given his rubles and the costs and refund rates of the bottles.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Kolya buys a glass bottle, drinks the kefir, returns the bottle, and then uses the refunded money along with his remaining rubles to buy another glass bottle. This is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not account for.

For example, consider the following input:
```
17
11
9
8
```
- Kolya starts with 17 rubles.
- He buys one glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 8 rubles.
- He returns the glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 16 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 7 rubles.
- He returns the second glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 15 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 6 rubles.
- He returns the third glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 14 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 5 rubles.
- He returns the fourth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 13 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 4 rubles.
- He returns the fifth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 12 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 3 rubles.
- He returns the sixth glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 11 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 2 rubles.
- He returns the seventh glass bottle and gets 8 rubles back, making his total 10 rubles.
- He can now buy another glass bottle for 9 rubles, leaving him with 1 ruble.
- He cannot buy another glass bottle with the remaining 1 ruble.

Thus, Kolya can drink a total of 7 liters of kefir. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 2 liters. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.
