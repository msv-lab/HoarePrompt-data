The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\) inclusive, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. It then calculates all unique divisors of `n` and sorts them in ascending order. If `k` is greater than the number of divisors of `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor of `n`. If `k` equals the number of divisors, the function will print the largest divisor. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value, but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `n` is a prime number, in which case the function will only have two divisors (1 and `n` itself).
