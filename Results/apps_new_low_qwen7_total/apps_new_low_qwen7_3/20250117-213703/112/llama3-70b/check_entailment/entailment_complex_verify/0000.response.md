### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step and use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   ```python
   (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   This reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   ```python
   divisors = []
   for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
       if n % i == 0:
           divisors.append(i)
           if i * i != n:
               divisors.append(n // i)
   ```
   This loop finds all divisors of `n` and appends them to the `divisors` list. Note that it handles both divisors `i` and `n // i` only once, ensuring no duplicates.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   ```python
   divisors.sort()
   ```
   This sorts the list of divisors in ascending order.

4. **Checking and Printing Result**:
   ```python
   if k > len(divisors):
       print(-1)
   else:
       print(divisors[k - 1])
   ```
   This checks if `k` is within the bounds of the sorted divisors list. If `k` is within bounds, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the states and variables involved in each part of the code. The annotations help us understand that the program correctly finds all divisors, sorts them, and checks bounds before accessing the `k-th` element.

#### Validation:
The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case when `k` is larger than the total number of divisors. However, upon closer inspection of the code and annotations, we see that the program already includes a check to ensure `k` is within the bounds of the `divisors` list before attempting to access it. Specifically, the line:
```python
if k > len(divisors):
    print(-1)
else:
    print(divisors[k - 1])
```
ensures that the program only attempts to print `divisors[k - 1]` if `k` is within the valid range of indices of `divisors`.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the provided code already correctly handles the scenario where `k` is larger than the number of divisors by printing `-1` in that case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and handles all edge cases as required by the problem description.
