You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15. The variable `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n
    divisors.sort()
    if (k > len(divisors)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(divisors[k - 1])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n). If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `divisors[k - 1]` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is correct.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` by evaluating `n % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` (if they are different) to the `divisors` list.
   - This ensures that all divisors of `n` are found and stored in `divisors`.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The `divisors` list is sorted using `divisors.sort()`. This step is necessary to find the k-th smallest divisor.

4. **Output**:
   - The program checks if the length of `divisors` is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are fewer than `k` divisors.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` has fewer than `k` divisors correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also correctly sorts the divisors to ensure the k-th smallest divisor is found.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
