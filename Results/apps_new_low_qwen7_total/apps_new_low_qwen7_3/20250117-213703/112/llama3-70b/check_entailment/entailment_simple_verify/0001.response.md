### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is correct.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` by evaluating `n % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` (if they are different) to the `divisors` list.
   - This ensures that all divisors of `n` are found and stored in `divisors`.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The `divisors` list is sorted using `divisors.sort()`. This step is necessary to find the k-th smallest divisor.

4. **Output**:
   - The program checks if the length of `divisors` is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are fewer than `k` divisors.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` has fewer than `k` divisors correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also correctly sorts the divisors to ensure the k-th smallest divisor is found.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program correctly finds and prints the k-th smallest divisor of `n` or returns `-1` if there are fewer than `k` divisors. The logic and handling of edge cases are appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
