### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and compare it with the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - State: `n` and `k` are valid inputs with \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) to find all divisors of `n`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors` list.
   - This ensures all divisors are found and added to the list.
   - State: After the loop, `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n`.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The `divisors` list is sorted.
   - State: `divisors` is now a sorted list of all unique divisors of `n`.

4. **Checking if k-th Divisor Exists**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`.
     - If `k` is greater, it prints `-1` because there are fewer than `k` divisors.
     - If `k` is not greater, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor.
   - This is handled correctly in the annotated code:
     ```python
     if k > len(divisors):
         print(-1)
     else:
         print(divisors[k - 1])
     ```

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program already handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of divisors correctly by printing `-1` and then accessing `divisors[k - 1]` safely. There is no need for further modification.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
