You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15. The variable `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n
    divisors.sort()
    if (k > len(divisors)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(divisors[k - 1])
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n). If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `divisors[k - 1]` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is larger than the total number of divisors of `n`. Specifically, the program assumes that `divisors[k-1]` will always exist, which is not true if `k` exceeds the number of divisors. For example, consider the input:

```
5 3
```

The number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. Since `k` is 3, the program incorrectly outputs -1, which is the correct output according to the problem description. However, the issue lies in the logic that does not properly handle cases where `k` is out of bounds. The program should check if `k` is within the range of available divisors before accessing `divisors[k-1]`. 

To fix this, you can modify the program as follows:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])
```

This version correctly checks if `k` is within the bounds of the divisors list before attempting to access it.
