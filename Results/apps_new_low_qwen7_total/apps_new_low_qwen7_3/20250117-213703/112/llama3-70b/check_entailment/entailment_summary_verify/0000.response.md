### Reasoning:

The original assessment is actually **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the provided program and its logic:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input.
   - It calculates all unique divisors of `n` and sorts them in ascending order.
   - If `k` is greater than the number of divisors, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor of `n`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
   - For each divisor `i` found, it appends both `i` and `n // i` to the `divisors` list.
   - After finding all divisors, the list is sorted.
   - The program checks if `k` is within the bounds of the `divisors` list before printing `divisors[k-1]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is a prime number, it indeed has only two divisors: 1 and `n` itself.
   - The program handles this correctly by sorting the divisors and then checking if `k` is within the bounds.

4. **Original Assessment Critique**:
   - The original assessment suggests that the program does not handle the case when `k` is larger than the total number of divisors. This is incorrect because the program explicitly checks if `k` is greater than the length of the `divisors` list before attempting to access `divisors[k-1]`. This check ensures that the program does not attempt to access an index out of bounds.

Given these points, the original assessment is incorrect. The provided program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `k` is larger than the number of divisors.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
