You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
5 3

Output
-1

Input
12 5

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\) inclusive, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. It then calculates all unique divisors of `n` and sorts them in ascending order. If `k` is greater than the number of divisors of `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the `k-th` smallest divisor of `n`. If `k` equals the number of divisors, the function will print the largest divisor. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value, but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `n` is a prime number, in which case the function will only have two divisors (1 and `n` itself).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is correct.

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` by evaluating `n % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it adds both `i` and `n // i` (if they are different) to the `divisors` list.
   - This ensures that all divisors of `n` are found and stored in `divisors`.

3. **Sorting Divisors**:
   - The `divisors` list is sorted using `divisors.sort()`. This step is necessary to find the k-th smallest divisor.

4. **Output**:
   - The program checks if the length of `divisors` is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are fewer than `k` divisors.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor by accessing `divisors[k - 1]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` has fewer than `k` divisors correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also correctly sorts the divisors to ensure the k-th smallest divisor is found.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected according to the problem description.
