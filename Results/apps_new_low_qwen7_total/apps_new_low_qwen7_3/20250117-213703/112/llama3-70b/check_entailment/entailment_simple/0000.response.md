Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` from input.
2. It then finds all unique divisors of `n` by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n` and adding both `i` and `n//i` to the `divisors` list when `i` is a divisor of `n`.
3. After finding all divisors, the program sorts the list of divisors.
4. The program checks if `k` is greater than the number of divisors. If it is, it prints `-1`, indicating that there are not enough divisors to reach the `k`-th one.
5. If `k` is within the range of the number of divisors, it prints the `k`-th smallest divisor, which is at index `k-1` in the sorted list.

Given the problem requirements and the steps taken by the program, it correctly implements the logic to find the `k`-th smallest divisor of `n`.

Correctness: **True**
