Reasoning:  
The given program correctly identifies all divisors of \( n \) by iterating up to the square root of \( n \) and adding both the divisor and its corresponding pair (if they are not the same). After sorting the list of divisors, it checks if \( k \) is within the bounds of the list length. If \( k \) exceeds the number of divisors, it prints \(-1\), indicating that there are fewer than \( k \) divisors. Otherwise, it prints the \( k \)-th smallest divisor. 

The logic handles various scenarios, including when \( n \) is a prime number (which would have only two divisors: 1 and \( n \)), and it correctly outputs \(-1\) when \( k \) is out of bounds. The sorting step ensures that the divisors are in ascending order, making it easy to access the \( k \)-th smallest divisor.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program appears to work as intended according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
