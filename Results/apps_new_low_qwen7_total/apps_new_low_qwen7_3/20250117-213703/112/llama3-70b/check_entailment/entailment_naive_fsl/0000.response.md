Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is larger than the total number of divisors of `n`. Specifically, the program assumes that `divisors[k-1]` will always exist, which is not true if `k` exceeds the number of divisors. For example, consider the input:

```
5 3
```

The number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. Since `k` is 3, the program incorrectly outputs -1, which is the correct output according to the problem description. However, the issue lies in the logic that does not properly handle cases where `k` is out of bounds. The program should check if `k` is within the range of available divisors before accessing `divisors[k-1]`. 

To fix this, you can modify the program as follows:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    divisors.sort()
    if k > len(divisors):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(divisors[k - 1])
```

This version correctly checks if `k` is within the bounds of the divisors list before attempting to access it.
