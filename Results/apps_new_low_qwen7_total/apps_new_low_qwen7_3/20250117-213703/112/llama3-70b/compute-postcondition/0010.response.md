`divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Initially, `divisors` contains only the value 2. The value of `i` is 2, so `n // i` is equivalent to `n // 2`. The other variables (`total`, `k`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing 2 and `n // 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 2**
