Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n), and k is less than or equal to the length of `divisors`**
