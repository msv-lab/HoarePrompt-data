Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), and `divisors` is a list containing 2 and \(n // 2\). If \(i * i \neq n\), `i` is increased by 1.***

Explanation: Since the if condition `n % i == 0` is met, the following actions are taken: `divisors` is updated to include \(n // 2\) if \(n\) is divisible by `i` (which is 2 in this context). Additionally, if \(i * i \neq n\), `i` is increased by 1. Given that there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false. Therefore, the final state of `divisors` is as described above, and the other variables (`total` and `k`) remain unspecified.
