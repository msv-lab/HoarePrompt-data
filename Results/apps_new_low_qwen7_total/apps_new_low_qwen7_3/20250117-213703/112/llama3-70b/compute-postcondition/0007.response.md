Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list. Initially, `divisors` contains [1]. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 1. If `n % i == 0` and `i * i` is not equal to `n`, then `divisors` is updated to include `n // 2`. If `i * i` equals `n`, then `divisors` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
