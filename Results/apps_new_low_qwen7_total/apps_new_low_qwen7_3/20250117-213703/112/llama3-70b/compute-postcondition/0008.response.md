Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5)`.
   - For each value of `i`, the loop checks if `n % i == 0` and if `i * i` is not equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, `divisors` is updated to include `n // i`.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`.
   - `divisors` is a list. Initially, it contains `[1]`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15`.
   - `i` is `1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The loop will check if `n % 2 == 0` and if `2 * 2` is not equal to `n`. If both conditions are met, `divisors` will be updated to include `n // 2`.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `2`.
- `n` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list that may contain additional elements if `n % 2 == 0` and `2 * 2 != n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 2**.
