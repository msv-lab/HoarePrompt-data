Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `n` within the range `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`.
2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `divisors` is a list containing `2` and `n // 2` if `n` is divisible by `i` (which is 2) and `i * i` is not equal to `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `divisors` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to consider how these variables change or remain the same.
   - `k` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so its state remains unchanged.
   - `divisors` is updated based on the value of `i` and `n`, but since we don't know the exact value of `n` or `i` from the previous iteration, we can only infer the potential changes.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range defined by `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, which is not mentioned.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` should be increased by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Since no specific changes to `n` are mentioned, we assume `n` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing 2 and \(n // 2\) if \(n\) is divisible by `i` (which is 2) and `i * i` is not equal to `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `divisors` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1**.
