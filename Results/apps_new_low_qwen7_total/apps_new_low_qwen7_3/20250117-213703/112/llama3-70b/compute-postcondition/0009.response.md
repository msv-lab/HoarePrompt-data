The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the `divisors` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `total` is unspecified
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `divisors` now contains the element 2 in addition to any other existing elements
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15
- `i` is 2

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing 2, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 2**
