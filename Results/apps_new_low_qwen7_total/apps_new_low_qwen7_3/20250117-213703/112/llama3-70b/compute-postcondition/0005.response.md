`divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 2, so `n // i` is `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list `divisors` will contain `[1, n // 2]`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing [1, n // 2], `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 2, and the current value of `i * i` is not equal to `n`**
