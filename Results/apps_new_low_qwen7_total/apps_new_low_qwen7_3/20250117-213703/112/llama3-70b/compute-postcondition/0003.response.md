The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `divisors`. Since `i` was previously set to 1 due to the condition `n % i == 0` being true, the list `divisors` will now contain the value 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing [1], `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 2.**
