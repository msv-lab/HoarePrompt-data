The given code snippet takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, and stores them in variables of the same names. It then initializes an empty list called `divisors`. However, no further operations are performed on `n` or `k`, nor is the `divisors` list populated. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `divisors` list remains empty.

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, divisors is an empty list**
