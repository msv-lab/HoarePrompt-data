Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15. The variable `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n ** 0.5) + 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it exceeds int(n ** 0.5).**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over integers from 1 to int(n ** 0.5) + 1.
   - For each integer `i`, if `n % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `n`.
   - If `i * i != n`, both `i` and `n // i` are appended to the `divisors` list. This ensures that only unique divisors are added to the list.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `divisors`: Updated with divisors of `n`.
   - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`: Remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `k`: Remains constant throughout the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to int(n ** 0.5) + 1.
   - Once `i` exceeds int(n ** 0.5), the loop terminates.
   - The final state of `divisors` will contain all unique divisors of `n`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop correctly identifies and appends divisors of `n`.
   - The loop ensures no duplicate entries by checking `i * i != n`.

Thus, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `divisors` will contain all unique divisors of `n`.
