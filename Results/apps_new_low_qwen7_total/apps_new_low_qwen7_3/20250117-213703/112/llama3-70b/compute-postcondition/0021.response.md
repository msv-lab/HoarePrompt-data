The code prints `-1`. Since the print statement does not assign any value to an existing variable or create a new one, the only change is that the value `-1` is printed. The variables `total`, `k`, `divisors`, `n`, and `i` remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n), and k is greater than the length of `divisors`; -1 is printed.**
