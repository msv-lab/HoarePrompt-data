Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing 2 and \(n // 2\). If \(i * i \neq n\), `i` is increased by 1. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition being true or false.***
