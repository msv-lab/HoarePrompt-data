The code `divisors.sort()` sorts the list `divisors` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `total`, `k`, `n`, or `i`. After sorting, the `divisors` list will contain all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n).**
