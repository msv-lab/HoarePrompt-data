Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` in sorted order, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, and `i` remains within the range of 1 to int(n). If `k` is greater than the length of `divisors`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `divisors[k - 1]` is printed.***
