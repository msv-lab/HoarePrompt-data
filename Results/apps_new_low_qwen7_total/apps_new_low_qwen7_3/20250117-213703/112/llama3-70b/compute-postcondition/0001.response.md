Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):`, so the variables involved in the loop are `i`, `n`, and the expression `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range function needs to generate at least one value for `i`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop)` generates values starting from `start` up to but not including `stop`.

3. **Analyze the Range Function:**
   - The start value is `1`.
   - The stop value is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if there exists at least one integer `i` such that `1 <= i < int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Condition for the Loop to Start:**
   - To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15`, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.
   - For `n = 1`, `int(1 ** 0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. Hence, the loop will execute.

5. **Initial Values of Variables:**
   - The initial value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{15}\).
   - The initial value of `k` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - The initial value of `divisors` is an empty list.

6. **Ensure the Loop Starts with the Correct Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, we need to ensure that `1` is within the range generated by the range function.

Given these points, we can conclude that the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (which is always true given the constraints). Therefore, the only condition needed for the loop to execute is that `i` should start at 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is unspecified, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `divisors` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15, `i` is 1**
