Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', and returns the count of blown light bulbs represented by '!' in the string `s`. It first initializes a dictionary `dead_bulbs` to zero for each of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G'. Then, it creates a dictionary `positions` to record the position of each of these colors modulo 4. For each character in `s`, if the character is '!', it increments the count of the corresponding color in `dead_bulbs` based on its position recorded in `positions`. If no '!' is present in `s`, the function will still execute the loops, but `dead_bulbs` will remain unchanged. The function finally prints the counts of blown light bulbs for each color.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that each of 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once in `s`, but the code does not check for this condition. Therefore, the function will still run even if one or more of these colors are missing.
- The code assumes that `s` is provided via `input()`, but it does not handle the case where `s` might be an empty string. This would cause an issue because the function expects a non-empty string.
- The code does not handle invalid characters other than 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', which could lead to unexpected behavior.
