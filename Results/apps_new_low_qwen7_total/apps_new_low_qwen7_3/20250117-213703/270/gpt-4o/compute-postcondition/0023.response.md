Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is unspecified, `char` is '!', `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values 0, 0, 0, 1, the loop can continue if there are more key-value pairs in the `positions` dictionary. If `i % 4 == pos`, `dead_bulbs`['G'] is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
