Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is 0, `char` is '!', `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary that must have at least one key-value pair. If `i % 4 == pos`, we encounter a KeyError trying to increment `dead_bulbs['!']`.***
