Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the total number of iterations executed (which is the length of `positions` times the number of iterations until the loop exits), `positions` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i % 4 == pos` for that key in `positions`. If the condition `char == '!'` is true, the value of `i` remains 1 and `dead_bulbs` remains unchanged. If `char != '!'`, the same conditions apply as above.***
