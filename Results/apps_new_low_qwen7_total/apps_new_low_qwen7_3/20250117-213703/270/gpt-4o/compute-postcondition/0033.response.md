Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `positions` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `i % 4 == pos`, then one of the values in `dead_bulbs` is incremented by 1. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
