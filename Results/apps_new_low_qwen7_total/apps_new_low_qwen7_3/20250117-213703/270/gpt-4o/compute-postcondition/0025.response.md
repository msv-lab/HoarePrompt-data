Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values 0, 0, 0, 0, `positions` is a dictionary where the key is any of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' present in `s` and the value is the index of that character modulo 4. If `char` is '!', then `i` is 4 (or a multiple of 4). Otherwise, the state of the program remains as described in the precondition.***
