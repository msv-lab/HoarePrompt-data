Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary. If `char` is one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', `positions` is updated to contain the entry `{char: 1}`. If `char` is not one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', `positions` remains unchanged.***
