Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char` is the first character of the string `s`.
   - `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0.
   - `positions` is a dictionary containing the entry `{char: 0}` where `char` is one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character of the string `s` using `enumerate(s)`.

4. **Update the state after one iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `char` is the first character of `s`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `char` will be the second character of the string `s`.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is non-empty, the loop can continue if `i < len(s)`.

Given these points, we need to update the states of `i` and `char` for the next iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` will be 1.
- `char` will be the second character of the string `s`.

Since `dead_bulbs` and `positions` do not change based on the loop head, their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary containing the entry `{char: 0}` where `char` is one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G'.**
