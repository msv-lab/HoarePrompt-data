Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary. If `char` is in 'RBYG', `positions` is updated to `{char: 2}`. Since there is no else part, `positions` remains unchanged when `char` is not in 'RBYG'.***
