You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for (color, pos) in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where the length of s is between 4 and 100 inclusive. Each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once in s. Moreover, s represents a valid garland with some blown light bulbs, meaning no four consecutive characters in s are the same.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `s` - 1, `char` is the last character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary where the key is any of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' present in `s` and the value is the index of that character modulo 4. If a character in `s` is not one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', it does not affect the `positions` dictionary.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `s`, `char` is the last character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary where each key 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' has a value equal to the number of times the condition `i % 4 == positions[color]` was true for that key across all iterations, `positions` is an empty dictionary. The loop executes exactly once for each character in `s` unless the character is '!', in which case it only executes for the first occurrence of '!' in `s`. If no '!' is present, the loop does not execute at all.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', and returns the count of blown light bulbs represented by '!' in the string `s`. It first initializes a dictionary `dead_bulbs` to zero for each of the colors 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G'. Then, it creates a dictionary `positions` to record the position of each of these colors modulo 4. For each character in `s`, if the character is '!', it increments the count of the corresponding color in `dead_bulbs` based on its position recorded in `positions`. If no '!' is present in `s`, the function will still execute the loops, but `dead_bulbs` will remain unchanged. The function finally prints the counts of blown light bulbs for each color.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func()` reads a string `s` representing the garland and strips any leading/trailing spaces.

2. **Tracking Color Positions:**
   - A dictionary `dead_bulbs` is initialized to store the number of dead bulbs for each color.
   - Another dictionary `positions` is used to track the positions of non-dead (working) bulbs of each color.

3. **Identifying Working Bulbs:**
   - We iterate through the string `s` and check each character.
   - If the character is one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', we update the `positions` dictionary with the position of this working bulb.

4. **Counting Dead Bulbs:**
   - We iterate through the string `s` again.
   - If the character is '!', indicating a dead bulb, we check which color should have been at that position according to the garland pattern.
   - We increment the count of dead bulbs for that color in the `dead_bulbs` dictionary.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, we print the counts of dead bulbs for each color.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program seems to correctly identify and count the dead bulbs based on the position of the working bulbs and the pattern rule that no four consecutive bulbs can be the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the dead bulbs for each color. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
