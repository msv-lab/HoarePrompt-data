You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nothing is eternal in the world, Kostya understood it on the 7-th of January when he saw partially dead four-color garland.

Now he has a goal to replace dead light bulbs, however he doesn't know how many light bulbs for each color are required. It is guaranteed that for each of four colors at least one light is working.

It is known that the garland contains light bulbs of four colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The garland is made as follows: if you take any four consecutive light bulbs then there will not be light bulbs with the same color among them. For example, the garland can look like "RYBGRYBGRY", "YBGRYBGRYBG", "BGRYB", but can not look like "BGRYG", "YBGRYBYGR" or "BGYBGY". Letters denote colors: 'R' — red, 'B' — blue, 'Y' — yellow, 'G' — green.

Using the information that for each color at least one light bulb still works count the number of dead light bulbs of each four colors.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead. 

The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described. 

It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'. 

It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data. 


-----Output-----

In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly.


-----Examples-----
Input
RYBGRYBGR

Output
0 0 0 0
Input
!RGYB

Output
0 1 0 0
Input
!!!!YGRB

Output
1 1 1 1
Input
!GB!RG!Y!

Output
2 1 1 0


-----Note-----

In the first example there are no dead light bulbs.

In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}
    positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for (color, pos) in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where the length of s is between 4 and 100 inclusive. Each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once in s. Moreover, s represents a valid garland with some blown light bulbs, meaning no four consecutive characters in s are the same.
def func():
    s = input().strip()

dead_bulbs = {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'Y': 0, 'G': 0}

positions = {}
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char in 'RBYG':
            positions[char] = i % 4
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `s` - 1, `char` is the last character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary with keys 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' and values all set to 0, `positions` is a dictionary where the key is any of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' present in `s` and the value is the index of that character modulo 4. If a character in `s` is not one of 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', it does not affect the `positions` dictionary.
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '!':
            for color, pos in positions.items():
                if i % 4 == pos:
                    dead_bulbs[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `s`, `char` is the last character of the string `s`, `dead_bulbs` is a dictionary where each key 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G' has a value equal to the number of times the condition `i % 4 == positions[color]` was true for that key across all iterations, `positions` is an empty dictionary. The loop executes exactly once for each character in `s` unless the character is '!', in which case it only executes for the first occurrence of '!' in `s`. If no '!' is present, the loop does not execute at all.
    print(dead_bulbs['R'], dead_bulbs['B'], dead_bulbs['Y'], dead_bulbs['G'])



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of dead light bulbs for each color based on the given constraints. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program initializes a dictionary `dead_bulbs` to keep track of the number of dead light bulbs for each color.
2. It also initializes a dictionary `positions` to store the positions of the last seen non-dead light bulbs of each color.
3. As it iterates through the string, it updates the `positions` dictionary with the position of the current non-dead light bulb.
4. When it encounters a dead light bulb (`'!'`), it checks the position of the last seen non-dead light bulb of each color. If the current position modulo 4 matches the stored position, it increments the count of dead bulbs for that color.
5. Finally, it prints the counts of dead bulbs for each color.

This approach ensures that it handles all possible valid inputs as per the problem description. Since the garland is defined such that no four consecutive light bulbs have the same color, the logic correctly identifies the positions of the last seen non-dead light bulbs and counts the dead ones accordingly. There are no potential edge cases that the program fails to handle within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
