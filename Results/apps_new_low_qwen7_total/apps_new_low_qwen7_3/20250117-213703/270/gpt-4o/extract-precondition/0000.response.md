Precondition: **The input string s is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', 'G', and '!', where the length of s is between 4 and 100 inclusive. Each of the characters 'R', 'B', 'Y', and 'G' appears at least once in s. Moreover, s represents a valid garland with some blown light bulbs, meaning no four consecutive characters in s are the same.**
