### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies that for each pair \((a, b)\), the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) must hold true, meaning \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\).
- It also ensures that \(a \neq b\) to prevent forming a square.
- The function iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` ensuring \(a < b\) to avoid redundant pairs due to symmetry (i.e., swapping \(a\) and \(b\) results in the same pair).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the input value `n` and calls `func_1(n)`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loops iterate over possible values of `a` and `b` such that \(a + b = \frac{n}{2}\) and \(a \neq b\). This ensures that the conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square are met.
3. **Output**: The function returns the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

However, as noted in the original assessment, the code does not explicitly check if \(n \geq 6\). While the function will naturally produce `0` for cases where \(n < 6\) (since no valid pairs can exist), adding an explicit check at the beginning of `func_1` would be good practice to enhance clarity and robustness.

#### Validation Using Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `func_1` ensures \(a \neq b\) and checks the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\). This implies that the function handles the necessary conditions without any issues related to invalid inputs.
- The function summary does not mention handling the minimum length requirement, which suggests it implicitly relies on the input being valid (i.e., \(n \geq 6\)).

Given that the function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1` and the code correctly implements the logic, the original assessment's concern about the lack of a minimum length check is valid but does not necessarily make the program incorrect. The function inherently produces `0` for invalid inputs, fulfilling the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary. The original assessment was accurate in pointing out the missing check, but the program still functions correctly and produces the expected output for valid inputs.
