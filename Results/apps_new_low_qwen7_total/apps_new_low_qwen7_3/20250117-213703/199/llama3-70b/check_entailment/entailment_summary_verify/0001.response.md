Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` in detail and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check if they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length of the stick is used to form two pairs of equal parts.
   - The condition `a != b` ensures that the stick is split into at least two different lengths, preventing the formation of a square.

2. **Range of Values**:
   - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` to ensure that the remaining part after splitting `a` and `b` can still form valid pairs.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to ensure `b` is within the valid range and prevents forming a square.

3. **Rectangle Formation**:
   - For the parts to form a rectangle but not a square, at least two different lengths must be used among the four parts. This is correctly enforced by the condition `a != b`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 6`, the only valid combination is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is counted once.
   - For `n = 20`, the valid combinations are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The function correctly counts these four ways.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is odd or less than 4, as it will not find any valid pairs and result in `ways` being 0.

Given the detailed analysis and example verifications, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Final: **True**
