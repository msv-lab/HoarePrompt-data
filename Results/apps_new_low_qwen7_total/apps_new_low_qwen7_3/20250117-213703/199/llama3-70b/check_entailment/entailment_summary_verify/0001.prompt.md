You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.

- Program:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and returns the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) where \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). After the function executes, the variable `ways` holds the count of such pairs, and `a` and `b` are the last valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition. The function does not explicitly return `a` and `b`, only `ways`. The function ensures that both `a` and `b` are integers and that `n` is even. If `n` is odd or less than 4, the function will not find any valid pairs, resulting in `ways` being 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze if the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates over possible values for `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are two of the four parts of the stick. The conditions inside the function ensure that:
   - `a` and `b` are distinct (`a != b`).
   - The total length of the stick is used to form two pairs of equal parts (`2 * (a + b) == n`).

2. **Rectangle Formation**: For the parts to form a rectangle but not a square, at least two different lengths must be used among the four parts.

3. **Range of Values**: 
   - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` because the total length is `n`, and if `a` were greater than `n // 2`, `b` would have to be less than 1.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to ensure `b` is within the valid range and does not repeat the condition of forming a square.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 6`, the only valid combination is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is counted once.
   - For `n = 20`, the valid combinations are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The function correctly counts these four ways.

Based on this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
