Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze if the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates over possible values for `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are two of the four parts of the stick. The conditions inside the function ensure that:
   - `a` and `b` are distinct (`a != b`).
   - The total length of the stick is used to form two pairs of equal parts (`2 * (a + b) == n`).

2. **Rectangle Formation**: For the parts to form a rectangle but not a square, at least two different lengths must be used among the four parts.

3. **Range of Values**: 
   - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` because the total length is `n`, and if `a` were greater than `n // 2`, `b` would have to be less than 1.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to ensure `b` is within the valid range and does not repeat the condition of forming a square.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 6`, the only valid combination is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is counted once.
   - For `n = 20`, the valid combinations are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The function correctly counts these four ways.

Based on this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
