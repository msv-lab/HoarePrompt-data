Reasoning:
1. **Input Analysis**: The input \( n \) is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( 2 \times (a + b) = n \) and \( a \neq b \).
   - For each valid pair \((a, b)\), it increments the `ways` counter.
3. **Loop Conditions**:
   - \( a \) ranges from 1 to \( \frac{n}{2} \).
   - \( b \) ranges from \( a \) to \( \frac{n - a}{2} \).
4. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition \( 2 \times (a + b) = n \) ensures that the sum of the lengths is equal to \( n \).
   - The condition \( a \neq b \) ensures that no part of the stick forms a square.
5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function returns the total number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) which represents the number of ways to cut the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( n \) is odd because no valid pairs \((a, b)\) exist when \( n \) is odd, leading to `ways` remaining 0.

Given the logic and the constraints, the function correctly implements the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
