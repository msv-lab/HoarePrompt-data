Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the case where the stick length `n` is less than 6. According to the problem description, Pasha needs to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts, which means the minimum length of the stick should be at least 6 (1+1+1+3=6). However, the program does not check this condition and attempts to compute the number of ways to split the stick for any positive integer length `n`. For example, if the input is `5`, the program will still attempt to run the loop, but it should not as it's impossible to split a stick of length 5 into four positive integer parts.

To fix this, we need to add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to ensure that `n` is at least 6 before proceeding with the calculations.
