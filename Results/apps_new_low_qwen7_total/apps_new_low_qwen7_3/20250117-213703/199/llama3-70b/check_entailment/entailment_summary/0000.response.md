Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the stick.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to count the number of valid ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

The logic inside the function works as follows:
- It iterates over all possible values of `a` (from 1 to `n//2`).
- For each value of `a`, it iterates over all possible values of `b` (from `a` to `(n-a)//2`).
- It checks if `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `ways` counter.
- The function finally returns the count of such valid pairs.

This logic ensures that:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- The sum of `a`, `b`, and the other two parts (which are also integers and must be positive) equals `n`.
- The resulting parts can form a rectangle (`a != b`), but not a square (`2 * (a + b) == n`).

Given the constraints and the execution summary, the function appears to implement the required logic accurately. The program does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is odd or less than 4, which is correct because in those cases, no valid splits are possible.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
