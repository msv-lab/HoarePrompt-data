Reasoning:

The provided program logic correctly implements the solution for the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Validation**: The program takes an integer `n` as input, which is within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).

2. **Loop Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). This ensures that the four segments can form a rectangle (since opposite sides must be equal) but not a square (since all sides would need to be equal, violating \(a \neq b\)).

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each valid pair \((a, b)\), the counter `ways` is incremented. This correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of valid pairs, which is the required output.

Given the problem constraints and the detailed explanation provided, the function `func_1` accurately computes the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

Correctness: **True**
