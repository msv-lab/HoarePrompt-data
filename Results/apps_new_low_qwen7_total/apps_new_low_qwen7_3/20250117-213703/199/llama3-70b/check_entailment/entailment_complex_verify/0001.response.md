### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
  - The parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
  - The parts must be of positive integer lengths and their sum must be `n`.

#### Function Logic:
- The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` where:
  - `a` and `b` are distinct (`a != b`).
  - The total length of the stick is used to form two pairs of equal parts (`2 * (a + b) == n`).

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` because the total length is `n`, and if `a` were greater than `n // 2`, `b` would have to be less than 1.
   - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` to ensure `b` is within the valid range and does not repeat the condition of forming a square.

2. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - `a != b`: Ensures that the parts are distinct.
   - `2 * (a + b) == n`: Ensures that the parts can form a rectangle (two pairs of equal parts).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 6`, the only valid combination is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is counted once.
   - For `n = 20`, the valid combinations are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The function correctly counts these four ways.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is odd or less than 4, the function will not find any valid pairs, resulting in `ways` being 0. This is correct because no valid splits can be made.

5. **Distinct Combinations**:
   - The function ensures that each combination is counted only once, as it checks `a != b` and uses distinct values for `a` and `b`.

Given the detailed analysis, the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment accurately describes the function's behavior and its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the original assessment.
