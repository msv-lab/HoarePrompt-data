    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` must be even and within the range of 4 to \(2 \times 10^9\), `ways` is the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), `a` is the last valid value of `a` that satisfies the condition, and `b` is the last valid value of `b` that satisfies the condition.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #   - `ways` starts at 0 and increments each time a valid pair is found.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` remains constant as it is not modified inside the loop.
    #   - `ways` increases each time a valid pair is found.
    #   - `a` and `b` change based on the conditions in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will execute as long as there are valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
    #   - For each valid pair, `ways` is incremented.
    #   - The loop will stop once all possible valid pairs have been checked.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The final value of `ways` will be the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
    #   - `a` and `b` will be the last valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition after the loop completes.
    #
    #Since the loop checks all possible values of `a` and `b` from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), the final state will be as described above.
    return ways
    #`ways` is the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), `a` is the last valid value of `a` that satisfies the condition, and `b` is the last valid value of `b` that satisfies the condition. The program returns `ways`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and returns the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) where \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). After the function executes, the variable `ways` holds the count of such pairs, and `a` and `b` are the last valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition. The function does not explicitly return `a` and `b`, only `ways`. The function ensures that both `a` and `b` are integers and that `n` is even. If `n` is odd or less than 4, the function will not find any valid pairs, resulting in `ways` being 0.
