Output State: `n` must be even and within the range of 4 to \(2 \times 10^9\), `ways` is the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), `a` is the last valid value of `a` that satisfies the condition, and `b` is the last valid value of `b` that satisfies the condition.

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `ways` starts at 0 and increments each time a valid pair is found.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` remains constant as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `ways` increases each time a valid pair is found.
   - `a` and `b` change based on the conditions in the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - For each valid pair, `ways` is incremented.
   - The loop will stop once all possible valid pairs have been checked.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final value of `ways` will be the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - `a` and `b` will be the last valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition after the loop completes.

Since the loop checks all possible values of `a` and `b` from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2}\), the final state will be as described above.
