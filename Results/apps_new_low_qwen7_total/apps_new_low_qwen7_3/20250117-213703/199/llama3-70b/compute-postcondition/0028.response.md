`ways` is incremented by 1. Since `a` is 2 and `b` is 2, the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` implies that `n` is 8 (the only even number greater than or equal to 4 that fits the equation with `a` and `b` both being 2). The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 2, `n` is 8, `ways` is 1**
