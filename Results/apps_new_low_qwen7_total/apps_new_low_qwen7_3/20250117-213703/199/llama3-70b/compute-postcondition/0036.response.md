Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Inside the loop, it checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`. If both conditions are met, it increments `ways`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Invariant Variables**: `n` and `a` are not modified within the loop.
- **Variable `b`**: Changes based on the loop iteration.
- **Variable `ways`**: Increases by 1 each time the conditions inside the loop are satisfied.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

Given the initial state where `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, and `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition, we need to find the final values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `ways`.

The loop will continue to increment `b` until it finds all valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). The loop will stop once there are no more valid `b` values.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the provided output states, we can see the pattern:
- After the first iteration (`b = 2`), `ways` is 1.
- After the second iteration (`b = 3`), `ways` is still 1.
- After the third iteration (`b = 4`), `ways` is 2.

This indicates that the loop continues to find valid pairs and update `ways` accordingly. Given the initial state, the loop will continue to find all possible pairs \((a, b)\) until `b` reaches the maximum value that satisfies the condition.

Since `n` is even and `a` is fixed at 2, the valid pairs \((2, b)\) will be \((2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), \ldots\) until \(2 + b > \frac{n}{2}\).

For an even `n`:
- If \(n = 8\), the valid pairs are \((2, 6)\) because \(2 + 6 = 8 / 2\).

Thus, `b` will be the largest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\).

### Final Output State

After the loop finishes, `a` remains 2, `b` is the largest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\), `n` remains unchanged, and `ways` is the total number of valid pairs found.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\), `n` is 8, and `ways` is the total number of valid pairs \((2, b)\) such that \(2 + b \leq \frac{n}{2}\).**
