Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: The initial state is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `ways`: The initial state is that `ways` is 0.
   - **Loop Variable:** The loop variable in this case is `b`, which is initialized in the `range` function.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `b` in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Determine the First Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute its first iteration, the value of `b` must satisfy the range condition:
     - The smallest possible value of `b` in the range is `a`.
     - The largest possible value of `b` in the range is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Start:**
   - For the loop to start, `a` must be within the valid range such that there exists a `b` that satisfies the range condition.

5. **Constraints for the First Iteration:**
   - To ensure the loop can start and execute the first iteration, `b` must be at least `a` and the upper bound `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be a positive number.
   - Since `b` is the loop variable, we need to ensure that `a` is such that `(n - a) // 2 + 1 > a`.

6. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - Given the initial conditions, `n >= 3` and `ways = 0`, we need to ensure that the loop can start with some valid `b`.

### Final State:
For the loop to execute its first time, `b` must be within the range defined by `a` and `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Specifically, `b` must be at least `a` and the upper bound must be valid.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 0, `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, and `b` is now at least `a`.**

Given the initial constraints, a specific adjustment can be made to ensure the loop can start. Let's assume `a` is set to a valid starting point that allows the loop to begin. 

A common choice would be to set `a` to 0 (assuming non-negative integers), which simplifies the range calculation.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 0, `a` is 0, and `b` is 0.**

This ensures that the loop can start and execute its first iteration.
