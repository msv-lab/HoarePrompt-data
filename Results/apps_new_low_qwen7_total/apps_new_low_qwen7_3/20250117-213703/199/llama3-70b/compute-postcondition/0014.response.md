Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as follows:
  ```python
  for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```
- Initial states before the loop starts:
  - `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4.
  - `ways` is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
  - `a` is 1.
  - `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `a`:**
   - It is given that `a` is 1.

2. **Condition for the Loop Head (`b`):**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - For the loop to start executing, `b` must be within this range.

3. **Determine the Starting Value of `b`:**
   - Since `a` is 1, the loop will start with `b = a`, which means `b` must be 1 initially.

4. **Range of `b`:**
   - The upper limit of `b` is \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - Substituting `a = 1`, we get the upper limit as \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\).

5. **Initial Validity of `b`:**
   - To ensure the loop starts, `b` must satisfy the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - Substituting `a = 1`, we get \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) which simplifies to \(2 + 2b == n\) or \(2b == n - 2\).
   - Therefore, \(b = (n - 2) / 2\).

6. **Initial State Requirements:**
   - `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` must be \((n - 2) / 2\).

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4.
- `a` must be 1.
- `b` must be \((n - 2) / 2\).

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is \((n - 2) / 2\)**.
