Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the range for `b` as `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is within the specified range. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `ways` is increased by 1 if `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\); otherwise, `b` becomes \(\left(\frac{(n - 2)}{2} + 1\right)\).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `b`, the value of `b` needs to be updated for the next iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `b` should be set to the next value in the range, which would be `a + 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `b`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` is `a + 1`**.
