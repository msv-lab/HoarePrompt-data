Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that will change during each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop variable is `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4.
   - `ways` is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `a` is 0.
   - `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts with `a = 1` and increments `a` until it reaches `n // 2 + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `a` will be incremented from 0 to 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `a` will be 1.
   - Since the loop condition depends on `a`, the other variables (`n`, `ways`, and `b`) remain unchanged for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `n` remains the same and must still be even and greater than or equal to 4.
   - `ways` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop variable `a`.
   - `a` is now 1.
   - `b` remains the last valid value that satisfies the condition from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\), `a` is 1, and `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition.**
