Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step-by-step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Inside the loop, it checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`. If both conditions are met, it increments `ways` by 1.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `ways` is 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is not specified but starts from 0 in each iteration.

### Track Variable Changes
- `ways` is incremented by 1 whenever the condition `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied.
- `a` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- `b` changes based on the loop iteration.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop increments `ways` for each valid pair `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are distinct and their sum is half of `n`.
- `a` remains 0 because the loop always starts with `b` from `a`.

### Verify Relationships
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be even because `2 * (a + b) == n` implies that `n` must be even.
- If `n` is odd, the loop will never execute because there are no integer pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` with `a` and `b` being distinct.

### Final Output State
- `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4 (since `n` must be even and the loop starts checking from `a=0`).
- `a` remains 0.
- `b` takes on all valid values that satisfy the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.

If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, the loop will continue until `b` reaches the maximum value allowed by the condition. The final value of `ways` will be the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`, `a` is 0, and `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition.**
