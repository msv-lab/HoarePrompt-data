The `ways` variable is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 2, so after the increment, `ways` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `ways` is 3, `a` is 0, `b` is 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `ways` is 3, `a` is 0, `b` is 2**
