`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `b` is still `a + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` is `a + 1`, `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` is `a + 1`, `ways` is incremented by 1**
