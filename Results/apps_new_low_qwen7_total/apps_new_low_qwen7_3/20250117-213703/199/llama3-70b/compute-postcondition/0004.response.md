`ways` is incremented by 1, which means `ways` is now 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is not equal to `b` and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is 0, and `b` is 0. The current value of `a` is not equal to `b` and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.**
