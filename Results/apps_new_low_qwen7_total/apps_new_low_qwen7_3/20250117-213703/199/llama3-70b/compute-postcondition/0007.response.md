`ways` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ways` is 1, so after executing `ways += 1`, `ways` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 0, `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 0, `b` is 1**
