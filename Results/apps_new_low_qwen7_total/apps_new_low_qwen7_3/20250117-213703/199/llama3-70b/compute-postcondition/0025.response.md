Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `a`. Therefore, the only variables in the loop head are `a` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - `ways` is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `a`**:
   - The loop starts with `a = 1` and increments `a` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `a` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `a` will be `2`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The state of `a` needs to be updated to `2`.
   - The state of `n` remains unchanged because `n` is not being modified within the loop.

5. **State of `b` and `ways`**:
   - These values depend on the current value of `a` and the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). However, since we are focusing on adjusting the loop head variables, these values are not directly modified here but will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `b` is the last valid value that satisfies the condition, and `ways` is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b**.
