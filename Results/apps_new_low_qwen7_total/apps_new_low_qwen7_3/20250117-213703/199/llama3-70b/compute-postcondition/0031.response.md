`ways` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0 (since it is mentioned as unchanged and initially should be considered as 0 in this context). The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 2, `b` is 3, `n` is 8, `ways` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 3, `n` is 8, `ways` is 1**
