Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and returns the total number of unique pairs \((a, b)\) where \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\). After the function executes, the variable `ways` holds the count of such pairs, and `a` and `b` are the last valid values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition. The function does not explicitly return `a` and `b`, only `ways`. The function ensures that both `a` and `b` are integers and that `n` is even. If `n` is odd or less than 4, the function will not find any valid pairs, resulting in `ways` being 0.**

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is odd, no valid pairs \((a, b)\) exist, so `ways` will be 0.
- If `n` is 4, the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), but since \(a \neq b\), no valid pairs are found, and `ways` will be 0.
- If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\), the behavior is undefined, but the function will not run for such inputs due to the initial constraint check.
