`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain the same, and `b` becomes \(((n - 2) / 2) + 1\). The output state is: `ways` is increased by 1; `n` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `b` becomes \(((n - 2) / 2) + 1\).
Output State: **`ways` is increased by 1; `n` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `b` becomes \(((n - 2) / 2) + 1\)**.
