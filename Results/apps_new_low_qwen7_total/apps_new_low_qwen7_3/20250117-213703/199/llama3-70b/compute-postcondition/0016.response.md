`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is \((n - 2) / 2\), `ways` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is \((n - 2) / 2\), `ways` is increased by 1**
