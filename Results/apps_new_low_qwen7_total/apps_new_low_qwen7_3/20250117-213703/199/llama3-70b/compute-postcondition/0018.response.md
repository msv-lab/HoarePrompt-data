Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is \((n - 2) / 2\).
   - If `a` is not equal to `b` and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\), then `ways` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - For each iteration, the value of `b` changes but the values of `n` and `a` remain the same because they are not modified within the loop.
   - The loop continues as long as `b` satisfies the condition in the range.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop modifies `b` but does not modify `n` or `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b`.

5. **Determine the New Value of `b`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is \((n - 2) / 2\).
   - In the next iteration, `b` will increment by 1 (since the loop starts from `a` and increments by 1).

6. **New State:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` becomes \(((n - 2) / 2) + 1\).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 1, `b` is ((n - 2) / 2) + 1**
