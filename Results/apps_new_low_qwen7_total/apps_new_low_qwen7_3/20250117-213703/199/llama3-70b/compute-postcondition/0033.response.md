Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 2
   - `b` is 3
   - `n` is 8
   - `ways` is 1 (since `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) = n`)

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
   ```

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The loop starts with `b = a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - Given `a = 2` and `n = 8`, the upper limit of the range is `(8 - 2) // 2 + 1 = 5`.

4. **Previous Iteration Details:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was 3.
   - The loop body was omitted, but we know the condition for the next iteration.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `b` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, `b` will be 4.

6. **New State:**
   - `a` remains 2.
   - `b` becomes 4.
   - `n` remains 8.
   - `ways` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself (it would still be 1 unless the condition changes).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 4, `n` is 8, `ways` is 1**
