Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 2
   - `b` is 2
   - `n` is 8
   - `ways` remains unchanged, meaning it could be 0 or not set yet.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
   ```
   The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`.

3. **Current Values Before Loop Execution:**
   - `a` is 2
   - `b` is 2
   - `n` is 8

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `b` is within the range defined by the loop head, i.e., `b` should be in the range `[2, (8 - 2) // 2 + 1] = [2, 3]`.
   - Therefore, `b` can be either 2 or 3.

5. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `b` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `b` is incremented to 3.
   - The values of `a`, `n`, and `ways` should remain unchanged unless the loop body sets them differently, but based on the given condition, they won't change.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `b` needs to be set to 3.
- `a` and `n` should remain unchanged.
- `ways` should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 3, `n` is 8, `ways` is unchanged**.
