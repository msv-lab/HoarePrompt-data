Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` using `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`.
   - The variables involved are `a`, `b`, and `n`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the range function generates values for `b`.
   - For the loop to generate at least one value for `b`, the range should not be empty.
   - The range starts from `a` and ends at `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - Therefore, the starting point `a` should be less than or equal to the ending point `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Check the Conditions:**
   - Given that `a` is 2, we need to ensure that the starting point of the range is valid.
   - We need to check if `a <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - Since `a` is 2, substitute `a` into the inequality:
     \[
     2 \leq (n - 2) // 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     2 \leq (n - 2) // 2 + 1 = \frac{n - 2}{2} + 1 = \frac{n - 2 + 2}{2} = \frac{n}{2}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2 \leq \frac{n}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     4 \leq n
     \]
   - Since `n` is already given to be even and greater than or equal to 4, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Determine Initial Values:**
   - The initial value of `b` in the loop will be `a`, which is 2.

6. **Final State for the Loop Head:**
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` starts from 2.
   - `n` must satisfy \(n \geq 4\) and is even.

Thus, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 2, `n` must be even and greater than or equal to 4**.
