You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). It constructs a set of integers starting from 2 up to \( 2n \) in steps of 2, and then adds integers from 3 up to \( 3m \) in steps of 3. The function finally prints the maximum value in the constructed set. If \( n \geq m \), the loop condition fails to execute, resulting in a set containing only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating all possible tower heights that can be constructed with the given constraints and then finding the maximum height among them. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Set Initialization**: A set named `towers` is initialized to store unique tower heights.

3. **Generating Heights for Two-Block Pieces**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - For each iteration, it adds `i * 2` to the `towers` set.
   - This correctly generates all possible tower heights for students using two-block pieces.

4. **Generating Heights for Three-Block Pieces**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `m`.
   - For each iteration, it adds `i * 3` to the `towers` set.
   - This correctly generates all possible tower heights for students using three-block pieces.

5. **Finding Maximum Height**:
   - The `max()` function is used to find the highest value in the `towers` set.
   - This ensures that the tallest tower's height is determined.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:
- The problem specifies that the heights should be unique and non-zero. While the current code ensures uniqueness by using a set, it does not guarantee that the set will contain the minimum possible heights starting from 2 and 3 respectively.
- The current approach starts the generation from 1, which means the set might include heights like 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., but it doesn't necessarily cover the gaps between these values. For example, if `n=1` and `m=1`, the heights would be 2 and 3, and the maximum would be 3, which is incorrect because the smallest possible unique heights are 2 and 3, not including any gaps.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we start generating heights from the smallest possible values (2 for two-block pieces and 3 for three-block pieces) and increment by their respective block counts.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    # Generate all possible tower heights for two-block pieces starting from 2
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    # Generate all possible tower heights for three-block pieces starting from 3
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    # Ensure the set contains the minimum possible unique heights
    min_heights = sorted(towers)
    # Find the maximum height
    max_height = max(min_heights)
    print(max_height)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is almost correct but fails to handle the generation of minimum unique heights correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
