You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). It constructs a set of integers starting from 2 up to \( 2n \) in steps of 2, and then adds integers from 3 up to \( 3m \) in steps of 3. The function finally prints the maximum value in the constructed set. If \( n \geq m \), the loop condition fails to execute, resulting in a set containing only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of students using two-block pieces (`n`) is zero. In this scenario, the program will only consider the students using three-block pieces, which may not cover all possible tower heights as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input `0 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `6` because the students can make towers of heights 3 and 6 blocks. However, the current implementation will return `9` because it will only add multiples of 3 to the set of tower heights.

To fix this issue, the program needs to ensure that it covers both cases where `n` and `m` can be zero. A corrected version of the program could look like this:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    
    if n > 0:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            towers.add(i * 2)
    
    if m > 0:
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            towers.add(i * 3)
    
    if not towers:
        # If no valid tower heights are found, calculate the minimum required height
        max_height = max(2 * n, 3 * m)
    else:
        max_height = max(towers)
    
    print(max_height)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero, and it calculates the minimum possible height of the tallest tower accordingly.
