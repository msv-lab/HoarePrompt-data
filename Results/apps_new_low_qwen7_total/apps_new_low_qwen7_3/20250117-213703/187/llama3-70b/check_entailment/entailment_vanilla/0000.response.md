### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating all possible tower heights that can be constructed with the given constraints and then finding the maximum height among them. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Set Initialization**: A set named `towers` is initialized to store unique tower heights.

3. **Generating Heights for Two-Block Pieces**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - For each iteration, it adds `i * 2` to the `towers` set.
   - This correctly generates all possible tower heights for students using two-block pieces.

4. **Generating Heights for Three-Block Pieces**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `m`.
   - For each iteration, it adds `i * 3` to the `towers` set.
   - This correctly generates all possible tower heights for students using three-block pieces.

5. **Finding Maximum Height**:
   - The `max()` function is used to find the highest value in the `towers` set.
   - This ensures that the tallest tower's height is determined.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:
- The problem specifies that the heights should be unique and non-zero. While the current code ensures uniqueness by using a set, it does not guarantee that the set will contain the minimum possible heights starting from 2 and 3 respectively.
- The current approach starts the generation from 1, which means the set might include heights like 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., but it doesn't necessarily cover the gaps between these values. For example, if `n=1` and `m=1`, the heights would be 2 and 3, and the maximum would be 3, which is incorrect because the smallest possible unique heights are 2 and 3, not including any gaps.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we start generating heights from the smallest possible values (2 for two-block pieces and 3 for three-block pieces) and increment by their respective block counts.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    # Generate all possible tower heights for two-block pieces starting from 2
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    # Generate all possible tower heights for three-block pieces starting from 3
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    # Ensure the set contains the minimum possible unique heights
    min_heights = sorted(towers)
    # Find the maximum height
    max_height = max(min_heights)
    print(max_height)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is almost correct but fails to handle the generation of minimum unique heights correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
