### Reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` and `m` are read from the input and are non-negative integers with \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\).

2. **Loop Execution for Towers with Two-Block Pieces**:
   - A set `towers` is initialized to store unique values.
   - The first loop runs from `i = 1` to `n`, adding values `2 * i` to the `towers` set.
   - This ensures that the set contains all even numbers from 2 to `2n`.

3. **Loop Execution for Towers with Three-Block Pieces**:
   - The second loop runs from `i = 1` to `m`, adding values `3 * i` to the `towers` set.
   - This ensures that the set contains all multiples of 3 from 3 to `3m`.

4. **Set Final State**:
   - The set `towers` now contains all even numbers up to `2n` and all multiples of 3 up to `3m`.
   - Since `n` and `m` are distinct sets of numbers, there are no overlapping numbers unless specifically calculated (which does not happen here).

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The maximum value in the `towers` set is printed, which represents the height of the tallest tower.
   - This ensures that no two students have the same number of blocks, satisfying the uniqueness condition.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is zero, the maximum height will be the highest multiple of 3 within the range.
   - If `m` is zero, the maximum height will be the highest even number within the range.

7. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the generation of unique tower heights.
   - The maximum value in the set will be the required height of the tallest tower.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum height of the tallest tower such that no two students have the same number of blocks.

### Correctness:
**True**
