Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n + 1`; `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}`; `n` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `3 * m + 1`, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3 * 1, 3 * 2, ..., 3 * m}`, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, and `n + 1` must be less than `m + 1`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m + 1` (exclusive).
    #   - In each iteration, the value `i * 3` is added to the `towers` set.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Starts at `n + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m + 1`. Therefore, after `m` iterations, `i` will be `n + 1 + m = m + 1 + n - 1 = 3 * m + 1 - 3 = 3 * m + 1`.
    #   - `towers`: Initially contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}`. In each iteration, `i * 3` is added to the set, so after `m` iterations, `towers` will contain `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3, 6, 9, ..., 3 * m}`.
    #   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #3. **Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes**:
    #   - The loop will execute `m` times if `n + 1 <= m + 1`, which simplifies to `n < m`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - After `m` iterations, `i` will be `3 * m + 1` as derived.
    #   - `towers` will contain all the elements of the form `2k` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n` and `3k` for `k = 1, 2, ..., m`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop finishes executing is as stated above.
    print(max(towers))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). It constructs a set of integers starting from 2 up to \( 2n \) in steps of 2, and then adds integers from 3 up to \( 3m \) in steps of 3. The function finally prints the maximum value in the constructed set. If \( n \geq m \), the loop condition fails to execute, resulting in a set containing only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).
