You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 3

Output
9

Input
3 2

Output
8

Input
5 0

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
    print(max(towers))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

towers = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        towers.add(i * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n + 1`; `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}`; `n` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        towers.add(i * 3)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is `3 * m + 1`, `towers` is a set containing `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3 * 1, 3 * 2, ..., 3 * m}`, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, and `n + 1` must be less than `m + 1`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m + 1` (exclusive).
    #   - In each iteration, the value `i * 3` is added to the `towers` set.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Starts at `n + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m + 1`. Therefore, after `m` iterations, `i` will be `n + 1 + m = m + 1 + n - 1 = 3 * m + 1 - 3 = 3 * m + 1`.
    #   - `towers`: Initially contains `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n}`. In each iteration, `i * 3` is added to the set, so after `m` iterations, `towers` will contain `{2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, 3, 6, 9, ..., 3 * m}`.
    #   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #3. **Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes**:
    #   - The loop will execute `m` times if `n + 1 <= m + 1`, which simplifies to `n < m`.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - After `m` iterations, `i` will be `3 * m + 1` as derived.
    #   - `towers` will contain all the elements of the form `2k` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n` and `3k` for `k = 1, 2, ..., m`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after the loop finishes executing is as stated above.
    print(max(towers))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of students using two-block pieces (`n`) is zero. In this scenario, the program will only consider the students using three-block pieces, which may not cover all possible tower heights as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input `0 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `6` because the students can make towers of heights 3 and 6 blocks. However, the current implementation will return `9` because it will only add multiples of 3 to the set of tower heights.

To fix this issue, the program needs to ensure that it covers both cases where `n` and `m` can be zero. A corrected version of the program could look like this:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    
    if n > 0:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            towers.add(i * 2)
    
    if m > 0:
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            towers.add(i * 3)
    
    if not towers:
        # If no valid tower heights are found, calculate the minimum required height
        max_height = max(2 * n, 3 * m)
    else:
        max_height = max(towers)
    
    print(max_height)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero, and it calculates the minimum possible height of the tallest tower accordingly.
