Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of students using two-block pieces (`n`) is zero. In this scenario, the program will only consider the students using three-block pieces, which may not cover all possible tower heights as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input `0 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `6` because the students can make towers of heights 3 and 6 blocks. However, the current implementation will return `9` because it will only add multiples of 3 to the set of tower heights.

To fix this issue, the program needs to ensure that it covers both cases where `n` and `m` can be zero. A corrected version of the program could look like this:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    towers = set()
    
    if n > 0:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            towers.add(i * 2)
    
    if m > 0:
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            towers.add(i * 3)
    
    if not towers:
        # If no valid tower heights are found, calculate the minimum required height
        max_height = max(2 * n, 3 * m)
    else:
        max_height = max(towers)
    
    print(max_height)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero, and it calculates the minimum possible height of the tallest tower accordingly.
