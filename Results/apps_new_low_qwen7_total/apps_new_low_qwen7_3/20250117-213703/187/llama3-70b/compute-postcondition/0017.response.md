Functionality: **The function takes two non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). It constructs a set of integers starting from 2 up to \( 2n \) in steps of 2, and then adds integers from 3 up to \( 3m \) in steps of 3. The function finally prints the maximum value in the constructed set. If \( n \geq m \), the loop condition fails to execute, resulting in a set containing only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).**

Edge Cases:
- If \( n = 0 \) and \( m = 0 \), the function will not print anything because the conditions \( n + m > 0 \) are not met.
- If \( n = 0 \) and \( m > 0 \), the set will contain only multiples of 3 from 3 to \( 3m \).
- If \( n > 0 \) and \( m = 0 \), the set will contain only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where \( n \) and \( m \) are both zero, although the condition \( n + m > 0 \) ensures this scenario is skipped. However, it is worth noting that if both \( n \) and \( m \) are zero, the function would fail to meet the condition \( n + m > 0 \), leading to no output.
