`towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i * 2` equals 4. Therefore, the set `towers` will now contain the elements `{2, 4}`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4}, `n` must be at least 2**
