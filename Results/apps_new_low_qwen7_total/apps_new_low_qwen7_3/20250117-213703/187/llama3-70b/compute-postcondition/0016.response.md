The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the relationship between two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, where both 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.

However, since no specific output logic or conditions are provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameter constraints and the fact that the function returns some value without specifying the exact nature of the return value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the relationship between two non-negative integers n and m, where both 0 <= n, m <= 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.**
