`towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Since `i` is 1 by default, `i * 2` is 2. Therefore, the set `towers` now contains the element 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only adds an element to the set and does not modify `i`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `towers` is a set containing {2}**
