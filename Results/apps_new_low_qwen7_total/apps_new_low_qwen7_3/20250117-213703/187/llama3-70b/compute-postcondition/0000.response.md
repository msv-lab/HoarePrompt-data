The initial state is that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). The code reads two integers from input and splits them into `n` and `m`, then initializes an empty set named `towers`.

Since the input values for `n` and `m` are not specified, we can represent the final state with placeholders for these values. However, we know they are non-negative integers and their sum is greater than zero. The `towers` set is initialized but no elements are added to it in the given code block.

Thus, the final state is:
Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, towers is an empty set**
