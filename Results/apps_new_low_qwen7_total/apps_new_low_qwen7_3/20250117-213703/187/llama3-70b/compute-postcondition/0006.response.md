`towers.add(i * 2)` adds the value of `i * 2` to the set `towers`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `i * 2` equals 6. Therefore, the set `towers` will now contain the elements {2, 4, 6}. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `towers` is a set containing {2, 4, 6}, `n` must be at least 3**
