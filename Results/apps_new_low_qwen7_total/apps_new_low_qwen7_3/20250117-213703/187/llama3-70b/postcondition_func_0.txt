The function takes two non-negative integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). It constructs a set of integers starting from 2 up to \( 2n \) in steps of 2, and then adds integers from 3 up to \( 3m \) in steps of 3. The function finally prints the maximum value in the constructed set. If \( n \geq m \), the loop condition fails to execute, resulting in a set containing only even numbers from 2 to \( 2n \).
