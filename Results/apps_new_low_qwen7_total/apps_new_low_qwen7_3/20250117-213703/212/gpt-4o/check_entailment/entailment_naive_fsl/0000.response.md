Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of correct answers `m` is less than `n - n // k`. According to the problem description, if Manao answers exactly `m` questions correctly, and `m` is less than `n - n // k`, the minimum score is simply `m % MOD`.

However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, the condition `if m <= n - n // k:` is incorrect because it should be `if m <= n - n // k - n % k:` to ensure that the logic for calculating the score when `m` is greater than `n - n // k` is applied only when necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k - n % k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m - n % k) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score
```

This correction ensures that the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
