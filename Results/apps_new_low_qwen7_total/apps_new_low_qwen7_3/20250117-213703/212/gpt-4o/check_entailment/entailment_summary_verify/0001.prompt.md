You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.

Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Input-----

The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 3 2

Output
3

Input
5 4 2

Output
6



-----Note-----

Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.

Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.

Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.

- Program:
MOD = 1000000009
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k
    remaining_correct = m % k
    if m <= n - n // k:
        score = m % MOD
    else:
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)
        remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k
        score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return score



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It calculates and returns a `score` based on the following conditions:
1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the function returns `m % MOD`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates additional variables:
   - `excess_full_sets` as `max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` as `m - excess_full_sets * k`.
3. The function then computes `score` using these values: `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD`.
4. The function covers the edge case where `m` might exceed `n - n // k`, and correctly computes `score` based on the described logic.
5. The function also handles the scenario where `m` is exactly `n - n // k`, which would fall under the first condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes the `MOD` value to `1000000009`, which is used for all computations to avoid overflow and ensure the results fit within standard integer ranges.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. These represent the total number of questions, the number of correct answers, and the threshold for doubling the score, respectively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `m`, and `k` as parameters.
   - It calculates `max_full_sets` as the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve with `m` correct answers.
   - `remaining_correct` is the number of additional correct answers beyond these full sets.
   - The program checks if `m` is less than or equal to `n - (n // k)`. If true, it suggests that Manao can achieve the maximum score without needing to double the score multiple times due to the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as the number of additional full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that Manao can achieve by answering some of the remaining questions incorrectly.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of additional correct answers beyond the full sets and any partial set of `k` correct answers.
   - The score is computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. The formula ensures that the score is minimized while accounting for the doubling of the score after every `k` consecutive correct answers.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses properties of modular arithmetic to compute powers and sums efficiently, ensuring that intermediate results do not overflow and that the final result is within the range of `0` to `1000000008`.

Given the logic and the use of modular arithmetic, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum possible score Manao can achieve under the given constraints. The approach accounts for the full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers and the remaining correct answers, ensuring the score is minimized.
