Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to calculate Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz under certain conditions related to consecutive correct answers and their effects on scoring.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the logic required to calculate this score.

2. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It first calculates `max_full_sets` as `m // k`, which represents the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve.
   - It then determines `remaining_correct` as `m % k`, representing any remaining correct answers after forming these full sets.
   - The condition `if (m <= n - n // k)` checks whether the total number of correct answers `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`. If true, it directly assigns `m % MOD` to `score`.
   - If the condition is false, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as `max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`, which represents additional sets of `k` consecutive correct answers beyond the initial full sets due to the constraint `n`.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is calculated as `m - excess_full_sets * k`, representing the number of remaining correct answers after accounting for the full and excess sets.
   - Finally, `score` is computed using modular arithmetic, considering the effect of doubling scores after achieving `k` consecutive correct answers multiple times.

3. **Reviewing the Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of modular exponentiation (`pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` and `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)`) is correct for handling large numbers efficiently.
   - The final expression for `score` ensures the result is within the modulo `1000000009`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n` are correctly handled by the function.
   - The logic accounts for the special case where `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k` by directly computing the score as `m % MOD`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible score under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
