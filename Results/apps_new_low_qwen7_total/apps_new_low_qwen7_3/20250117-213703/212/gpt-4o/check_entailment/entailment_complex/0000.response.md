Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible score based on the rules provided.
2. The logic inside the function handles different cases appropriately:
   - If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the score is simply `m % MOD`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers` accurately.
   - The final score calculation `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD` follows the mathematical principles of modular arithmetic and correctly accounts for the doubling of the score.
3. The use of `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` to calculate the modular inverse of 2 is appropriate for the final score calculation.
4. The function respects the constraints given (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n).

Given that the function follows the rules and constraints correctly, the annotated explanation aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.
