Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum possible score for Manao based on the rules specified in the problem. Let's break down the key parts of the program and ensure they align with the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 9\). This ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 9\) to handle large numbers.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Full Sets Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum number of full sets of consecutive correct answers (`max_full_sets`) that can be achieved by dividing `m` by `k`.
   - **Remaining Correct Answers**: It then calculates the remaining correct answers after accounting for the full sets (`remaining_correct`).
   - **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated considering the remaining correct answers and the contribution of the full sets. Specifically, the score is computed using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{score} = (\text{remaining\_correct\_answers} + k \times (2^{\text{excess\_full\_sets}} - 1) \times 2^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD})
     \]
   - The function handles the edge cases where the score needs to be computed differently depending on whether `m` is less than or equal to \(n - n // k\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m` is less than or equal to \(n - n // k\), the function simply returns `m % MOD`.
   - If `m` exceeds \(n - n // k\), the function calculates the excess full sets and the remaining correct answers to adjust the score accordingly.

Given the detailed breakdown and the logical flow of the program, the implementation appears to correctly follow the problem specification. The program accounts for all conditions and uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.

Correctness: **True**
