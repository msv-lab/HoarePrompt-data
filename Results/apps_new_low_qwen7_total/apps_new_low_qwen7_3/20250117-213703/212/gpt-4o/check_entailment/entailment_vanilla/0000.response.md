Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes the `MOD` value to `1000000009`, which is used for all computations to avoid overflow and ensure the results fit within standard integer ranges.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. These represent the total number of questions, the number of correct answers, and the threshold for doubling the score, respectively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `m`, and `k` as parameters.
   - It calculates `max_full_sets` as the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve with `m` correct answers.
   - `remaining_correct` is the number of additional correct answers beyond these full sets.
   - The program checks if `m` is less than or equal to `n - (n // k)`. If true, it suggests that Manao can achieve the maximum score without needing to double the score multiple times due to the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as the number of additional full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that Manao can achieve by answering some of the remaining questions incorrectly.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of additional correct answers beyond the full sets and any partial set of `k` correct answers.
   - The score is computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. The formula ensures that the score is minimized while accounting for the doubling of the score after every `k` consecutive correct answers.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses properties of modular arithmetic to compute powers and sums efficiently, ensuring that intermediate results do not overflow and that the final result is within the range of `0` to `1000000008`.

Given the logic and the use of modular arithmetic, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum possible score Manao can achieve under the given constraints. The approach accounts for the full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers and the remaining correct answers, ensuring the score is minimized.

Correctness: **True**
