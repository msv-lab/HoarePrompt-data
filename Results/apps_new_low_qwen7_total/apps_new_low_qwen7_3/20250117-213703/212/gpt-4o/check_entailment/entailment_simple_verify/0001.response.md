### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the `MOD` value to `1000000009`, which is used for all computations to avoid overflow and ensure the results fit within standard integer ranges.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. These represent the total number of questions, the number of correct answers, and the threshold for doubling the score, respectively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `m`, and `k` as parameters.
   - It calculates `max_full_sets` as the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve with `m` correct answers.
   - `remaining_correct` is the number of additional correct answers beyond these full sets.
   - The program checks if `m` is less than or equal to `n - (n // k)`. This condition is incorrect because `n - (n // k)` does not necessarily reflect the correct constraint for minimizing the score.
   - If `m` is less than or equal to `n - (n // k)`, it suggests that Manao can achieve the maximum score without needing to double the score multiple times due to the constraints. However, this condition is overly restrictive and may not always hold.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as the number of additional full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that Manao can achieve by answering some of the remaining questions incorrectly.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of additional correct answers beyond the full sets and any partial set of `k` correct answers.
   - The score is computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. The formula ensures that the score is minimized while accounting for the doubling of the score after every `k` consecutive correct answers.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses properties of modular arithmetic to compute powers and sums efficiently, ensuring that intermediate results do not overflow and that the final result is within the range of `0` to `1000000008`.

### Key Issues in the Program:
- The condition `if (m <= n - n // k)` is incorrect. This condition does not accurately reflect the correct constraint for minimizing the score. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where Manao can still achieve a lower score by strategically placing his incorrect answers.
- The logic for calculating `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers` is overly complex and does not always lead to the minimum possible score. The program needs to consider all possible ways to place the correct and incorrect answers to minimize the score.

### Correct Approach:
To minimize the score, Manao should aim to place as many incorrect answers as possible before achieving the threshold `k` for doubling the score. The correct approach involves calculating the minimum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers and the remaining correct answers, and then adjusting for the best placement of incorrect answers.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the condition `if (m <= n - n // k)` is incorrect and the logic for calculating the score is overly complex and may not always lead to the minimum possible score. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to find the minimum possible score in all cases.

**Final: False**
