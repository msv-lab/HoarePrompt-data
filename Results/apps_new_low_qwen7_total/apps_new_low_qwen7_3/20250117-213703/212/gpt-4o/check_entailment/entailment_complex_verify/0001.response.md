### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the `MOD` value to `1000000009`, which is used for all computations to avoid overflow and ensure the results fit within standard integer ranges.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. These represent the total number of questions, the number of correct answers, and the threshold for doubling the score, respectively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `m`, and `k` as parameters.
   - It calculates `max_full_sets` as the maximum number of full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers Manao can achieve with `m` correct answers. This is done using `max_full_sets = m // k`.
   - `remaining_correct` is the number of additional correct answers beyond these full sets. This is done using `remaining_correct = m % k`.
   - The program checks if `m` is less than or equal to `n - (n // k)`. If true, it suggests that Manao can achieve the maximum score without needing to double the score multiple times due to the constraints. This check is flawed because `n - (n // k)` is not a meaningful constraint for determining the minimum score. Instead, the program should focus on ensuring that Manao can achieve the minimum score by strategically placing the remaining correct answers.
   - If `m > n - (n // k)`, it calculates `excess_full_sets` as the number of additional full sets of `k` consecutive correct answers that Manao can achieve by answering some of the remaining questions incorrectly. This is done using `excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - ((n - m) // (k - 1))`.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` is the number of additional correct answers beyond the full sets and any partial set of `k` correct answers. This is done using `remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k`.
   - The score is computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. The formula ensures that the score is minimized while accounting for the doubling of the score after every `k` consecutive correct answers. However, the computation of the score using `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD` seems to be overly complex and may not correctly reflect the minimum possible score.

Given the logic and the use of modular arithmetic, the program's logic for calculating the minimum possible score is flawed. Specifically, the check `if m <= n - n // k` is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the minimum score scenario. Additionally, the computation of the score in the else block is overly complex and may not correctly reflect the minimum possible score.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the program correctly calculates the minimum possible score. The logic in the program is flawed, and the final score calculation is overly complex and may not yield the correct minimum score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
