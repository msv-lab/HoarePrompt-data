Postcondition: ***`max_full_sets` is `m // k`, `remaining_correct` is `m % k`, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `m` is an integer such that `0 ≤ m ≤ n`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then `score` is `m % MOD`. Otherwise, `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers` are integers, and `score` is an integer.***
