Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.

Code Block:
```
max_full_sets = m // k
remaining_correct = m % k
```

Analysis:
- The first line calculates the maximum number of full sets of size `k` that can be formed from `m` items and assigns this value to `max_full_sets`. This is done using integer division (`//`).
- The second line calculates the number of remaining items after forming the full sets and assigns this value to `remaining_correct`. This is done using the modulus operator (`%`).

Final Output State: **max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ n, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n**
