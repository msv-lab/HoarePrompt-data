The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. All three parameters are integers with the constraints that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`.

- If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the function returns `score` which is calculated as `m % MOD`.
- Otherwise, the function depends on `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and return a score based on the conditions provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and returns `m % MOD` if `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, otherwise it returns a value depending on `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers`.**
