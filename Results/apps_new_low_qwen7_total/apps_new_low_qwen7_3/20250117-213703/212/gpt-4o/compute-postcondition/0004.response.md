Let's break down the code and analyze its impact on the variables step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `max_full_sets = m // k`
- `remaining_correct = m % k`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq n\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\)
- \((m > n - n // k)\)

### Code Execution:

1. **excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)**:
   - Calculate `excess_full_sets` based on the given formula.
   - Here, `max_full_sets` is `m // k`.
   - \((n - m) // (k - 1)\) calculates how many additional full sets can be formed using the remaining correct answers.
   
2. **remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k**:
   - After forming the `excess_full_sets` number of full sets, the remaining correct answers are calculated.
   - This ensures that we account for the exact number of correct answers left after forming the full sets.

3. **score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD**:
   - Calculate the score based on the formula.
   - Here, `MOD` is assumed to be a constant modulus value, typically a large prime number used in modular arithmetic.
   - The term `pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD)` calculates \(2^{excess\_full\_sets} \mod MOD\).
   - The term `pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)` calculates the modular inverse of 2 modulo `MOD`.

### Final State Analysis:

- `max_full_sets` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned.
- `remaining_correct` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned.
- `m` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned.
- `k` remains unchanged because it is not reassigned.
- `excess_full_sets` is a new variable assigned in the first line.
- `remaining_correct_answers` is a new variable assigned in the second line.
- `score` is a new variable assigned in the third line.

Given the nature of the problem and the provided code, the final state includes the new variables `excess_full_sets`, `remaining_correct_answers`, and `score`, along with the unchanged variables `max_full_sets`, `remaining_correct`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

### Output State:
Output State: **max_full_sets is m // k, remaining_correct is m % k, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ n, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, (m > n - n // k), excess_full_sets is an integer, remaining_correct_answers is an integer, score is an integer**
