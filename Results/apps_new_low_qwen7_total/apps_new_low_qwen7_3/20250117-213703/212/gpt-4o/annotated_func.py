#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    max_full_sets = m // k

remaining_correct = m % k
    if (m <= n - n // k) :
        score = m % MOD
    else :
        excess_full_sets = max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)

remaining_correct_answers = m - excess_full_sets * k

score = (remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1
    ) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`max_full_sets` is `m // k`, `remaining_correct` is `m % k`, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `m` is an integer such that `0 ≤ m ≤ n`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, then `score` is `m % MOD`. Otherwise, `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers` are integers, and `score` is an integer.
    return score
    #The program returns `score` which is calculated as `m % MOD` if `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, otherwise it depends on `excess_full_sets` and `remaining_correct_answers`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ m ≤ n`. It calculates and returns a `score` based on the following conditions:
1. If `m` is less than or equal to `n - n // k`, the function returns `m % MOD`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates additional variables:
   - `excess_full_sets` as `max_full_sets - (n - m) // (k - 1)`.
   - `remaining_correct_answers` as `m - excess_full_sets * k`.
3. The function then computes `score` using these values: `(remaining_correct_answers + k * (pow(2, excess_full_sets, MOD) - 1) * pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD`.
4. The function covers the edge case where `m` might exceed `n - n // k`, and correctly computes `score` based on the described logic.
5. The function also handles the scenario where `m` is exactly `n - n // k`, which would fall under the first condition.
