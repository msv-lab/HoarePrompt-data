The function `func_3` accepts a non-empty string `word` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It processes the string by iterating through it and performing specific operations based on the conditions inside nested loops. The function uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine certain conditions. If a segment of the string (from `start` to `i`) meets the criteria defined in `func_2` and is at least three characters long, it extracts and appends substrings to the `result` list. Otherwise, it directly appends the segment to the `result` list. After processing the entire string, it returns a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the `result` list, separated by spaces.
