Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the block of consonants is exactly three characters long and consists of the same letter. According to the problem description, such blocks should not be considered typos. However, the `func_2` function always returns `True` for blocks of consonants that are three characters long and consist of the same letter, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `"aaaaaa"`:
- The program should not insert any spaces because the block of consonants "aaaa" does not contain at least two different letters.
- However, the current implementation would split the word incorrectly because `func_2` would always return `True` for any block of three identical consonants.

To fix this, the condition in `func_2` should be modified to exclude blocks of three identical consonants. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    if all(c == first_consonant for c in block):
        return False
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False
```

With this modification, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.
