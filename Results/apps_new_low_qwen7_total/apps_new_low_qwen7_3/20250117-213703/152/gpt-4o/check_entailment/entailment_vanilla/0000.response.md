### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality.

1. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1(c)` checks if a character `c` is a vowel.
   - `func_2(block)` checks if a block of characters contains at least three consonants in a row, but does not consider blocks where all consonants are the same.

2. **Main Function: `func_3(word)`**
   - It iterates through the word character by character.
   - It identifies blocks of consonants.
   - If a block of consonants has at least three characters and at least two different consonants (i.e., it fails the typo condition), it splits the word at the appropriate position.

3. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - **Identifying Consonant Blocks:** 
     - When a consonant is found (`while i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`), the function tries to find the end of a block of consonants.
   - **Checking Typos:**
     - If the block has at least three consonants and at least two different consonants (`if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i])`), the block is split.
     - The block is split into smaller blocks where each sub-block either contains only one consonant or is two consonants long (this ensures no consecutive three consonants).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the splitting logic.
   - It correctly identifies blocks of consonants and ensures that each resulting segment does not contain a typo.
   - The use of helper functions ensures that the logic for identifying vowels and checking the typo condition is encapsulated and reusable.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like single consonants and blocks of repeated consonants appropriately.
   - It correctly leaves words without typos unchanged.
   - It correctly splits words that have typos into segments without typos.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
