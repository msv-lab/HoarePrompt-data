Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies vowels using `func_1(c)` which checks if a character is in the set of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
2. The function `func_2(block)` checks if a block of characters is a typo, considering the constraints provided. It returns `True` if there are three or more consonants in a row, and at least two different letters among them.
3. In `func_3(word)`, the logic is designed to find segments in the word that contain potential typos and handle them accordingly. The algorithm ensures that blocks of consonants that meet the typo criteria are split appropriately.
4. The main loop in `func_3(word)` iterates through the word, splitting it when necessary to avoid typos. It handles both consonant blocks and vowel segments correctly.
5. The logic seems to cover all cases as described in the problem statement, including handling edge cases and ensuring minimal spacing is added to fix typos.

Given the annotations and the structure of the code, it appears that the program follows the requirements and should work as expected for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
