You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'

#Function 2:
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False

#Function 3:
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a non-empty string `word` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It processes the string by iterating through it and performing specific operations based on the conditions inside nested loops. The function uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine certain conditions. If a segment of the string (from `start` to `i`) meets the criteria defined in `func_2` and is at least three characters long, it extracts and appends substrings to the `result` list. Otherwise, it directly appends the segment to the `result` list. After processing the entire string, it returns a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the `result` list, separated by spaces.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the block of consonants is exactly three characters long and consists of the same letter. According to the problem description, such blocks should not be considered typos. However, the `func_2` function always returns `True` for blocks of consonants that are three characters long and consist of the same letter, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `"aaaaaa"`:
- The program should not insert any spaces because the block of consonants "aaaa" does not contain at least two different letters.
- However, the current implementation would split the word incorrectly because `func_2` would always return `True` for any block of three identical consonants.

To fix this, the condition in `func_2` should be modified to exclude blocks of three identical consonants. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    if all(c == first_consonant for c in block):
        return False
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False
```

With this modification, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.
