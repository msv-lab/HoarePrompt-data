You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

#Function 1:
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'

#Function 2:
def func_2(block):
    if len(block) < 3:
        return False
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
    return False

#Function 3:

    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
            i += 1
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        result.append(word[start:i])
    return ' '.join(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a non-empty string `word` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It processes the string by iterating through it and performing specific operations based on the conditions inside nested loops. The function uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine certain conditions. If a segment of the string (from `start` to `i`) meets the criteria defined in `func_2` and is at least three characters long, it extracts and appends substrings to the `result` list. Otherwise, it directly appends the segment to the `result` list. After processing the entire string, it returns a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the `result` list, separated by spaces.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality.

1. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1(c)` checks if a character `c` is a vowel.
   - `func_2(block)` checks if a block of characters contains at least three consonants in a row, but does not consider blocks where all consonants are the same.

2. **Main Function: `func_3(word)`**
   - It iterates through the word character by character.
   - It identifies blocks of consonants.
   - If a block of consonants has at least three characters and at least two different consonants (i.e., it fails the typo condition), it splits the word at the appropriate position.

3. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - **Identifying Consonant Blocks:** 
     - When a consonant is found (`while i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`), the function tries to find the end of a block of consonants.
   - **Checking Typos:**
     - If the block has at least three consonants and at least two different consonants (`if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i])`), the block is split.
     - The block is split into smaller blocks where each sub-block either contains only one consonant or is two consonants long (this ensures no consecutive three consonants).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the splitting logic.
   - It correctly identifies blocks of consonants and ensures that each resulting segment does not contain a typo.
   - The use of helper functions ensures that the logic for identifying vowels and checking the typo condition is encapsulated and reusable.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like single consonants and blocks of repeated consonants appropriately.
   - It correctly leaves words without typos unchanged.
   - It correctly splits words that have typos into segments without typos.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
