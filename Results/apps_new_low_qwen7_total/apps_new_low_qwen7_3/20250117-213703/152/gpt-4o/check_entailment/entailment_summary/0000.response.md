Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem requires us to identify words with consecutive consonants of at least three but not all identical, and then split those words by inserting spaces to avoid such consecutive consonants.
2. **Analysis of Functions:**
   - **func_1**: Checks if a character is a vowel. This is used to identify consonants.
   - **func_2**: Checks if a block of characters has at least three consonants in a row, with at least two different consonants. This is used to identify potential typos.
   - **func_3**: Processes the entire word, identifying segments that need splitting according to the rules set by `func_2`, and then inserting spaces appropriately.

Let's break down `func_3`:
   - It iterates through the word, identifying blocks of consonants.
   - If a block of consonants (length â‰¥ 3) contains at least two different consonants, it splits the block into smaller parts to avoid the typo.
   - If a block of consonants has only one type of consonant, it leaves it as is.
   - It also handles vowel segments properly.

Based on the provided execution summaries and the logic implemented in `func_3`, the function seems to correctly implement the required behavior:
   - It correctly identifies and splits blocks of consonants that meet the typo condition.
   - It correctly handles blocks of the same consonant without splitting.
   - It correctly handles transitions between consonant and vowel segments.

Since `func_3` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
