### Reasoning:

Let's review the implementation step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Helper Functions:**
   - **`func_1(c)`**: Checks if a character `c` is a vowel. This function is implemented correctly and handles only single-character strings.
   - **`func_2(block)`**: Checks if a block of characters is a typo. It correctly identifies blocks of three or more consonants with at least two different letters. The logic ensures that if all characters in the block are the same, it is not considered a typo.

2. **Main Function: `func_3(word)`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes necessary variables and prepares to process the string `word`.
   - **Loop Through Word**: It iterates through the string, using a start index (`start`) to mark the beginning of a potential typo.
   - **Skip Consonants**: Skips over consecutive consonants until a vowel is found or the end of the word is reached.
   - **Check Typo**: For each segment identified, it checks if it contains a typo using `func_2`.
     - If a segment is a typo, it splits the segment into smaller parts to avoid the typo.
     - If a segment is not a typo, it appends the segment as-is.
   - **Reassemble Result**: After processing, it reassembles the result by joining the processed segments with spaces.

### Validation:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Handling of empty words and single-character words (no action needed as they cannot contain a typo).
  - Proper handling of very long words (up to 3000 characters).
  - Correct splitting and reassembly of the word based on the defined rules.
  
- **Behavior Verification**:
  - Ensures that no typo-containing segments remain.
  - Ensures minimal insertion of spaces to correct the word.

Given the detailed review and understanding of the functions and their interactions, the implementation appears to correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies and corrects typos according to the specified rules.
- The functions are well-defined and interact appropriately to achieve the desired output.

### Correctness:
**True**
