Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture";  the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 

When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.


-----Output-----

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
hellno

Output
hell no 

Input
abacaba

Output
abacaba 

Input
asdfasdf

Output
asd fasd f

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    word = input().strip()
    print(func_3(word))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a single character string representing a small English letter.
def func_1(c):
    return c in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'c' is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') or False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `c` representing a small English letter. It checks whether `c` is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and returns `True` if `c` is a vowel, otherwise it returns `False`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. The only potential edge case is when `c` is not a single character string or is not a small English letter, in which case the behavior is undefined because the function relies on `c` being a single character string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, and its length is at least 3. All characters in block are consonants except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
def func_2(block):
    if (len(block) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: block is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, its length is at least 3, and all characters in block are consonants except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'
    first_consonant = block[0]
    for c in block:
        if c != first_consonant:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `block` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length of at least 3, where all characters except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' are consonants, `first_consonant` is the first character of `block`, and the function returns `True` if any character in `block` is not equal to `first_consonant`, otherwise it returns `False`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `block` which is a non-empty sequence of small English letters with a minimum length of 3, where all characters except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' are consonants. The function checks if there is any character in `block` that is not equal to the first character. If such a character is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- If any character in `block` is not equal to the first character, the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotations include:
- The function correctly handles the case where `block` contains only consonants and returns `False` if all characters are the same.
- The function correctly handles the case where `block` contains only consonants and returns `True` if there is any character different from the first one.
- The function correctly returns `False` when the length of `block` is less than 3, although this case is not explicitly covered in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_3(word):
    n = len(word)

result = []

i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        
        while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i]):
            result.append(word[start:start + 2])
            start += 2
            while start < i:
                result.append(word[start:start + 1])
                start += 1
        else:
            result.append(word[start:i])
        
        while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
            i += 1
        
        result.append(word[start:i])
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the original value of `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `n`, and `result` contains the processed substrings based on the conditions inside the loops.
    return ' '.join(result)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the list 'result' with a space between each element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a non-empty string `word` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It processes the string by iterating through it and performing specific operations based on the conditions inside nested loops. The function uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine certain conditions. If a segment of the string (from `start` to `i`) meets the criteria defined in `func_2` and is at least three characters long, it extracts and appends substrings to the `result` list. Otherwise, it directly appends the segment to the `result` list. After processing the entire string, it returns a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the `result` list, separated by spaces.
