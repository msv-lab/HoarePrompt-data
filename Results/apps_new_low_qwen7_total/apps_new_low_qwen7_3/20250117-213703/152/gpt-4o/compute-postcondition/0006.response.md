The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 2, so after executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `word[2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `word[2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`**
