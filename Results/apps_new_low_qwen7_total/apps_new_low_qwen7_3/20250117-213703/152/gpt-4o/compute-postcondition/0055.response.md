Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `n`, as well as the result of `func_1(word[i])`.

3. **Analyze the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   For the loop to continue, both conditions `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` must be true.

5. **Consider Each Condition Separately:**
   - **Condition `i < n`:** 
     Since `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` or `n` based on this condition alone.
   - **Condition `func_1(word[i])`:**
     We need to ensure that `func_1(word[2])` returns `True` for the loop to continue. However, we cannot directly modify `word` since we are only allowed to adjust states of objects in the loop head. Thus, we must ensure that the condition `func_1(word[2])` holds true.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The state of `i` (which is 2) and `n` (which must be greater than 1) is already correct to potentially satisfy the loop condition. However, we need to ensure `func_1(word[2])` is `True`.
   - Since we cannot modify `word`, we must assume the function `func_1` will return `True` for `word[2]` to allow the loop to continue.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - No adjustment is needed for `i` or `n` because they are already in a position where the loop could continue.
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[2])` returns `True`.

Therefore, the state remains the same, but we need to ensure that `func_1(word[2])` is `True`.

**State:**
**`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1 and `func_1(word[2])` must return `True`**
