The code snippet appends a substring from `word[start:i]` to the `result` list. Initially, `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `n`, and `n` is the original value of `n`. The `result` list contains `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

Since `i` is equal to `n` and `start` is also equal to `n`, the slice `word[start:i]` is equivalent to `word[n:n]`, which is an empty string.

Therefore, the code appends an empty string to the `result` list.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `start` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of (n - start) empty strings plus the slice word[start:n] followed by an additional empty string.**
