Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head condition is `i < n`.
   - The variable `i` is being compared against `n`.

2. **Determine the Current States**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is the length of `word`, so `n` is a positive integer.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is currently 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < n` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - For `0 < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Conclusion**: Since `i` is already 0, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute the first time is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
