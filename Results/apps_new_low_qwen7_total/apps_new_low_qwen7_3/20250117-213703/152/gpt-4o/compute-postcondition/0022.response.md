To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the loop condition and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `result` is a list.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` is true, `result` contains the substring `word[start:i]`. Otherwise, either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` is false, and `result` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - For the loop to enter the first iteration, `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Condition `func_1(word[i])`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

### Current State Before Loop:
- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Given this, the key point is that `i` is already set to the smallest index satisfying either `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` being `True`. Thus, the only additional requirement for the loop to execute the first time is that `i < n`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

### Final State:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.**
