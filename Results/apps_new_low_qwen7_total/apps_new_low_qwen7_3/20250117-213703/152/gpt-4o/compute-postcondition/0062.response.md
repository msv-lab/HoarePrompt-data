`i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. The value of `start` remains the same as the original value of `i`, `n` remains the same as its original value, and `result` remains the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `n`; `start` is equal to the original value of `i`; `n` is the original value of `n`; `result` is the initial state with an additional empty string appended; and `func_1(word[i])` must return False.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `start` is equal to the original value of `i`; `n` is the original value of `n`; `result` is the initial state with an additional empty string appended; and `func_1(word[i])` must return False.**
