The code `start = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `start`. The variable `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. The values of `word`, `n`, `result`, and `func_1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `start` is equal to `i`.**
