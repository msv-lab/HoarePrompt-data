Let's break down the conditions required for the loop to execute at least once.

1. The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
2. We need to ensure both parts of the condition are met for the loop to proceed.

- For the first part, `i < n`: This condition is already satisfied based on the given state (`i` is less than `n`).
- For the second part, `(not func_1(word[i]))`: This means that the function `func_1` should return `False` when applied to `word[i]`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is less than `n`
- `start` is equal to the original value of `i`
- `n` is the original value of `n`
- `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended

To satisfy the condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the current value of `i`.

Since no specific value of `word[i]` is provided, we cannot change the value of `word[i]` directly. However, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when evaluated.

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended, and `func_1(word[i])` must return False.**
