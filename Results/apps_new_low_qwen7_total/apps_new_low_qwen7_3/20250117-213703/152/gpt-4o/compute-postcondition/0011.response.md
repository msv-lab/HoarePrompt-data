Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the code to determine the final state:

### Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- `start` is an index such that `i - start` is at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 2])
start += 2
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `result.append(word[start:start + 2])`**
   - This line appends a substring of `word` from index `start` to `start + 2` (exclusive) to the list `result`.
   - After appending, `result` will contain this substring.
   
2. **Line 2: `start += 2`**
   - This line increments `start` by 2.
   - After incrementing, `start` will be increased by 2.

### Final State:
- `result` will contain the substring `word[start:start + 2]`.
- `start` will be incremented by 2.
- All other variables (`word`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `word`, `n`, `i`, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not provided, we can only describe the changes to `result` and `start`.

### Output State:
**Output State: **result is [substring from word starting at index start and ending just before start + 2], start is start + 2, word is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, n is greater than 0, i is the smallest index such that i >= n or func_1(word[i]) returns True, and start is an index such that i - start is at least 3 and func_2(word[start:i]) returns True.**
