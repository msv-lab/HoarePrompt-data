Let's analyze the given code block step-by-step:

Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000
- `n` is 0
- `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element
- `i` is the length of `word`
- `start` is equal to `i`
- The difference between `i` and `start` is at least 3
- `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`

Code Block:
```
result.append(word[start:start + 2])
start += 2
```

First Line: `result.append(word[start:start + 2])`
- `start` is initially equal to `i`
- The slice `word[start:start + 2]` corresponds to the substring from `word[i]` to `word[i+1]`
- This substring is appended to the list `result`
- After appending, `result` contains two elements: the original substring and the new substring `word[i] + word[i+1]`

Second Line: `start += 2`
- `start` is incremented by 2, so it now equals `i + 2`

Final State:
- `word` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged (still 0)
- `result` now contains the original substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` followed by the substring from `word[start]` to `word[start + 1]`
- `i` remains unchanged (still the length of `word`)
- `start` is now `i + 2`
- `func_2(word[start:i])` still returns `True` because the condition is based on the initial values and is not affected by the code execution

Output State: **word is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, n is 0, result is a list containing two substrings: the original one and another substring from word[i] to word[i+1], i is the length of word, start is i + 2, func_2(word[start:i]) returns True**
