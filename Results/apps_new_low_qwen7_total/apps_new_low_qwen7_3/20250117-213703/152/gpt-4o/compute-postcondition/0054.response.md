The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1**
