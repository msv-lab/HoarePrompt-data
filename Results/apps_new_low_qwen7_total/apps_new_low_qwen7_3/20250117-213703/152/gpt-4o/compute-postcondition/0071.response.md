Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 2, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, `result` now contains one more element `word[start:start + 1]`, `start` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state has `i` equal to `n`, `start` equal to `i + 2`, `result` as a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`, and `func_2(word[start:i])` returning `True`.
- The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending at `start + 1` to the list `result`. This adds one more element to the list `result`.
- The second line `start += 1` increments the value of `start` by 1. Therefore, `start` becomes `i + 3`.

Since the loop condition `start < i` cannot be satisfied (as `start` is always greater than or equal to `i`), the loop does not execute further. Thus, the final state includes the updated `result` list with the new appended element and the incremented `start` value.
