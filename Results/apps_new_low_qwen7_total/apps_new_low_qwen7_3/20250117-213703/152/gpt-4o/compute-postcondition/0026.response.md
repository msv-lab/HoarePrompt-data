Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is an index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i+1])` returns `True`.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     1. `i < n`
     2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` can be incremented within the loop body, but we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the current state.
   - Since `i < n` is already satisfied (as per the given state), we need to focus on the second condition, `func_1(word[i])`.
   - The next iteration of the loop requires that `i` is still less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

5. **Ensuring the Next Iteration**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` should be incremented to `i + 1` (since `func_1(word[i+1])` was true at the end of the previous iteration).
   - This increment should keep `i < n`, and `func_1(word[i])` should still return `True`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- Increment `i` to `i + 1`.
- Ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.
- Ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`**.
