Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step-by-step.

### Initial State
- `word`: A non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n`: An integer greater than 0.
- `result`: An empty list.
- `i`: Initially set to 0.
- `start`: Initially set to 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and not func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `not func_1(word[i])`.
2. **Increment**: On each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration: `i` becomes 1, and `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[0])`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` becomes 3, and `word[2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` becomes 5, and `word[4]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[4])`.

### Generalization
- After `k` iterations, `i` will be `2k - 1`, and `word[2k - 2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2k - 2])`.

### Final Iteration
- The loop will continue until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Final Values
- `i` will be the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Let's denote this final value of `i` as `i_final`.
- If `i_final < n`, then `func_1(word[i_final])` must be `True`.
- If `i_final == n`, then `func_1(word[n-1])` must be `False`.

### Invariants
- `start` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, the output state will be:
- `word`: A non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n`: An integer greater than 0.
- `result`: An empty list.
- `i`: The smallest index `i` such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.**
