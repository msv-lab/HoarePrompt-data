Output State: **i is equal to n, start is equal to the original value of i plus 2, result is a list of (n - start) empty strings with an additional element 'word[start:start + 2]', func_2(word[start:i]) returns True**

Explanation:
- The first line appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and ending at `start + 2` to the `result` list. This means that `result` now contains one more string compared to its previous state.
- The second line increments `start` by 2. This updates the value of `start` to `original_value_of_i + 2`.

Given that `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True` before these lines are executed, it remains `True` after the lines are executed because no operations affect `func_2` or `word`.

The precondition ensures that `i` and `n` remain unchanged, so they stay equal to their original values. The `start` variable is updated, and `result` is modified as described.
