The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, and `i < n` must be true. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, `start` is equal to `i`, and `i < n` must be true.**
