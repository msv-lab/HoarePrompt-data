Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `n`.
3. **Analyze the current state**: 
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`).
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true. This means `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, and assuming `func_1(word[i])` could potentially return `True` for some future `i` values, the only way to ensure the loop executes again is to decrease `n` so that `i` becomes less than `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop condition `i < n` is satisfied.

**Adjusted States**:
- `word` remains the same since it doesn't affect the loop condition.
- `n` needs to be decreased by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
- `result` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop condition.

**Final State**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), and `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.**
