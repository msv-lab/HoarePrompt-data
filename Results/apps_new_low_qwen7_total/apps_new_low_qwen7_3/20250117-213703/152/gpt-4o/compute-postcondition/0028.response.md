Let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **`word`**: This is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000. It remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This is a positive integer. It remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`result`**: The initial state of `result` is a list, but it is not affected by the loop unless specific conditions are met, which are not given in the problem statement. Therefore, we can assume `result` remains unchanged if no specific conditions trigger its update.
- **`i`**: This is the index starting from the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 as long as the conditions are met.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until the loop condition fails.

#### Final Output State
- **`word`**: Remains the same as the initial state.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial state.
- **`result`**: Remains the same as the initial state (unchanged unless specific conditions are met, but none are given here).
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, and `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.**
