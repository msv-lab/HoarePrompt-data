Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Determine which states can be adjusted**: The loop head involves two variables: `i` and `func_1(word[i])`. However, since `func_1` is a function and its return value is not directly adjustable in this context, we focus on adjusting `i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `start` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the original value of `n`.
   - `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

4. **Condition for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must evaluate to `True`.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, it cannot satisfy the condition `i < n`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is incremented to a value that satisfies both conditions (`i < n` and `func_1(word[i])`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `n` and potentially set up the condition for `func_1(word[i])` to be `True`.

Given these considerations, the state adjustment should reflect that `i` must be less than `n` and potentially updated to a valid index where `func_1(word[i])` evaluates to `True`.

State: **`i` must be less than `n` and `start` is `n-1`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.**
