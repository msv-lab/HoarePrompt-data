The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was originally less than `n`, and now it is incremented by 1, `i` is still less than `n`. The other variables (`start`, `n`, and `result`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `start` is equal to the original value of `i`; `n` is the original value of `n`; `result` has an additional empty string appended; `func_1(word[i])` must return False**
