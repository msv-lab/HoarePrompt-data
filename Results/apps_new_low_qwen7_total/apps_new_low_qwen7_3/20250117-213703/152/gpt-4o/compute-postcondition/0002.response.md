The code `start = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `start`. Given that `i` is initially set to 0, `start` is also assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `start` is 0**
