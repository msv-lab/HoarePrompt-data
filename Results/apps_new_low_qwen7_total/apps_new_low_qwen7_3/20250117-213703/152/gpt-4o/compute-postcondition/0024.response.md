To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

Given the current state:
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `result` is a list (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and `i` has been incremented by 1

For the loop to continue, both conditions must hold true:
1. `i < n` should be true.
2. `func_1(word[i])` should return `True`.

Let's break it down:
- Since `i` has been incremented by 1, it means `i` was previously equal to `n - 1` (because `i` is now the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`).
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
- Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for `i` to be valid.

Since `i` has been incremented, we need to ensure `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Thus, we need to adjust:
- Ensure `i < n` holds true.
- Ensure `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

Given that `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` would be the next index after the previous one. Therefore, the new value of `i` must satisfy both conditions.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be less than `n`.
- `func_1(word[i])` should return `True`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is an index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`**
