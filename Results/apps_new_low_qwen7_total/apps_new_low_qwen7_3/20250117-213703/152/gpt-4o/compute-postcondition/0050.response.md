Postcondition: ***`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is 0, `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element, `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` is equal to `i`. If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, then `result` contains all characters from `word[i-1]` to `word[i+1]` and `start` is `i`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element which is an empty string.***
