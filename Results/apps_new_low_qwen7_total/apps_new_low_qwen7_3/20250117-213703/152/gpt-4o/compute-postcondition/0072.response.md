To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition `start < i`.

Let's break down the relevant information from the provided state:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `start` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 2.
- `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`.
- `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.
- `result` now contains one more element `word[start:start + 1]`.
- `start` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `start < i` must be true. Currently, `start` is `i + 2`, so `start == i` (since `i` is equal to `n`), and thus `start >= i`. 

To satisfy the condition `start < i` for the next iteration, `start` must be less than `i`. Given that `start` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the current value of `start` should be adjusted to be less than `i` by reducing `start` by 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `start`.

**State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i + 1`, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, `result` now contains one more element `word[start:start + 1]`**
