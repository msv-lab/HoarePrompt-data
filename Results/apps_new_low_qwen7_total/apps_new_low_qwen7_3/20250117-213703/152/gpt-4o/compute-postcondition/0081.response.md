`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was `n-1`, so after incrementing, `i` becomes `n`.

The values of `start`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `start` is `n-1`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n].`**
