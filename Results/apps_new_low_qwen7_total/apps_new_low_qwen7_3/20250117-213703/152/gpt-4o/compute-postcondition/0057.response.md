Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.

### Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop is defined as:
```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    i += 1
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`

### Track Variable Changes
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop as long as the conditions are met.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`word`**: The string `word` remains unchanged.
- **`start`**: The value of `start` remains constant and is initialized to `i` before the loop starts.
- **`result`**: The behavior of `result` depends on whether `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`. However, since the loop itself does not modify `result`, we can focus on `i` and `n`.

### Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. Therefore, `i` will keep increasing until either:
- `i` equals `n` (loop exits)
- `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` (loop exits)

### Verify Relationships
From the provided output states:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is 1 and `n` is 1.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is increased by 1 each time.

These observations confirm that `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and it continues to do so as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.

### Determine the Final Output State
The loop will terminate when either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. Since the problem doesn't provide any specific condition for `func_1`, we assume the loop will terminate when `i` equals `n`.

Thus, the final state will be:
- `i` equals `n`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `start` remains constant and equals the initial value of `i`
- `result` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it

### Conclusion
Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, and `result` is the same as the initial state.**
