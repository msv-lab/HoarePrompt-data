To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions given in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < n and func_1(word[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` are true.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original value of `i`.
   - `n` is the original value of `n`.
   - `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.
   - If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, then `result` contains the slice `word[start:i]` instead.

3. **First Condition: `i < n`**
   - Given that `i` is initially equal to `n`, the condition `i < n` is false at the beginning.

4. **Second Condition: `func_1(word[i])`**
   - Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, the condition `func_1(word[i])` cannot be evaluated because `word[i]` is out of bounds (assuming `i` exceeds the length of `word`).

### Required Adjustments:

To make the loop executable in the first iteration, we need to adjust the state such that both conditions are met.

1. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - For `i < n` to be true, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to decrement `i` by 1 so that `i` becomes `n-1`.

2. **Ensuring `func_1(word[i])` is True:**
   - We need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` when `i` is `n-1`. This means that the function `func_1` should return `True` for the character `word[n-1]`.

### Final State Before the Loop:

Given the above adjustments, the final state before the loop should be:
- `i` is `n-1` (one less than the original value of `n`).
- `start` remains the original value of `i` (which is now `n-1`).
- `n` remains the original value of `n`.
- `result` remains as it is, but we know that the first condition is now satisfied (`i < n`), and we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.

### Conclusion:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `start` is `n-1`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`. Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` when `i` is `n-1`.**
