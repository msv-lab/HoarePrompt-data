To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions specified:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
```

This means the loop will continue as long as:
1. `i < n`
2. `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is less than `n`
- `start` is equal to the original value of `i`
- `n` is the original value of `n`
- `result` has an additional empty string appended
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - This condition is already satisfied since `i` is less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - The function `func_1` must return `False` for the current value of `i`.
   - Since the function `func_1` must return `False`, this condition is also satisfied.

### Next Iteration Requirements
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true at the start of the next iteration:
1. `i < n` must remain true.
2. `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False`.

Since `i` is incremented within the loop body, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself to ensure `i < n` remains true for the next iteration.

### Adjusted States
- `i` must be such that `i + 1 < n` (i.e., `i` should be incremented by 1).

### Final Answer
State: **`i` must be such that `i + 1 < n`**, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` has an additional empty string appended, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

However, to clearly state the required adjustments:

State: **`i` must be incremented to ensure `i + 1 < n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` has an additional empty string appended, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`**.
