Postcondition: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is 0, `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element, `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` is equal to `i`. Additionally, the difference between `i` and `start` is at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`**
