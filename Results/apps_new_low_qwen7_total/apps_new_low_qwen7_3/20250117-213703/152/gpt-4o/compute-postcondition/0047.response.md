Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates as long as `start` is less than `i`. Inside the loop, it appends a single character substring starting from `start` to `result` and then increments `start` by 1.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Result**: This list starts with two predefined substrings and then appends single characters based on the value of `start`.
- **Start**: Initially set to `i + 2`, it is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `i`.
- **i**: The length of the string `word`. It remains constant throughout the loop.
- **Word**: The initial string, which does not change.
- **Func_2(word[start:i])**: Returns `True`, but its return value does not affect the loop's execution.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

The loop will continue to execute as long as `start` is less than `i`. Each iteration appends a single character from `word[start:start+1]` to `result` and increments `start` by 1. Therefore, once `start` equals `i`, the loop stops.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

Given that the initial state is:
- `word` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is 0 (not used in the loop).
- `result` is initially `['', '']` (though only the second substring is relevant here).
- `i` is the length of `word`.
- `start` is initially `i + 2`.

The loop will append characters from `word[start:i]` to `result` until `start` equals `i`. 

From the provided outputs:
- After 1 iteration: `result = ['h']`, `start = 1`
- After 2 iterations: `result = ['h', 'i']`, `start = 2`
- After 3 iterations: `result = ['h', 'i', 'l']`, `start = 3`

We can infer that `start` starts at `i + 2` and increases by 1 in each iteration. Thus, the loop will continue appending characters until `start` reaches `i`.

### Final Calculation

If `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` starts at `i + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run `i - (i + 2) + 1 = i - 1` times. Hence, `result` will contain all characters from `word[i-1]` to `word[i+1]`.

Final Output State:
- `result` will be a list containing all characters from `word[i-1]` to `word[i+1]`.
- `start` will be equal to `i`.

Since the exact characters depend on the specific value of `word`, we can summarize as follows:

Output State: **result is a list containing all characters from word[i-1] to word[i+1], start is i.**
