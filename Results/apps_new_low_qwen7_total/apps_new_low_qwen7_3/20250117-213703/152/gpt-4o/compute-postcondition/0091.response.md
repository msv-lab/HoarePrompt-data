Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a non-empty string `word` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It processes the string by iterating through it and performing specific operations based on the conditions inside nested loops. The function uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine certain conditions. If a segment of the string (from `start` to `i`) meets the criteria defined in `func_2` and is at least three characters long, it extracts and appends substrings to the `result` list. Otherwise, it directly appends the segment to the `result` list. After processing the entire string, it returns a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the `result` list, separated by spaces.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input string `word` is exactly one character long, the function will simply return `word` itself since no further processing can occur.
- If the input string `word` is two characters long, the function will return these two characters as separate elements in the `result` list, each followed by a space, unless the second character does not meet the condition specified by `func_1`.
- The function relies on the existence and correct behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`. If either of these functions is not defined or does not behave as expected, the function may produce incorrect results.
