Given the initial state where `start` must be less than `i`, and the code snippet:
```python
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's break down the impact of this code block:

1. The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends a substring of `word` starting at index `start` and of length 1 to the list `result`. This means `result` will contain one character from `word`.
2. The second line `start += 1` increments the value of `start` by 1.

Since no specific values or `word` string are provided, we'll use placeholders. Let's assume `word` is a string and `start` and `i` follow the given precondition.

After executing the code snippet once, assuming `start` initially points to the correct position (less than `i`), the following happens:
- A character from `word` at index `start` is appended to `result`.
- `start` is incremented by 1.

The exact output depends on the initial values of `start` and `word`. However, we can represent the final state generally.

For instance, if `word = "hello"` and `start = 0` (and `i = 5` which satisfies the precondition):
- After the first execution, `result` becomes `['h']` and `start` becomes `1`.

Thus, the output state after running the code snippet once is:
Output State: **start is 1, result is ['h']**
