Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i + 1`, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, `result` now contains one more element `word[start:start + 1]`

Code Snippet:
```
result.append(word[start:start + 1])
start += 1
```

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state of `start` is `i + 1`.
2. The initial state of `result` is a list of `(n - (i + 1))` empty strings with an additional element `word[(i + 1):(i + 3)]`.

When the code snippet runs:
- The first line `result.append(word[start:start + 1])` appends `word[start:start + 1]` to the list `result`. Since `start` is initially `i + 1`, it appends `word[i+1:i+2]` to `result`.
- The second line `start += 1` increments `start` by 1, so `start` becomes `i + 2`.

After these operations:
- The new state of `start` is `i + 2`.
- The new state of `result` includes the previously defined elements and the newly appended element `word[i+1:i+2]`.

Final Output State: **i is equal to n, start is equal to i + 2, result is a list of (n - (i + 1)) empty strings with an additional element 'word[i+1:i+3]' and one more element 'word[i+1:i+2]'**, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`
