`start` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is less than `n`, and `start` is now equal to the original value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended.**
