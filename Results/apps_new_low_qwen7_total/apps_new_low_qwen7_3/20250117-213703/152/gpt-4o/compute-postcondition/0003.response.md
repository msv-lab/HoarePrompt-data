Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Analyze Each Variable**:
   - `i`: The loop will start with `i` set to 0.
   - `n`: `n` must be greater than 0 as given in the initial state.
   - `word[i]`: Since `i` starts at 0, we need to check `word[0]`.
   - `func_1(word[i])`: This function must return `False` for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` should return `False`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure `word[0]` does not satisfy `func_1`.

4. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `result` is an empty list (no change needed).
   - `i` is 0.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[i])`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[0])`**
