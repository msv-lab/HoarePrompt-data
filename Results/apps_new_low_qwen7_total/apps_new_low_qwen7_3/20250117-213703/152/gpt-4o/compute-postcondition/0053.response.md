Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 1.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` must be true.
   - Given `i = 1` and `n = 1`, the condition `i < n` evaluates to `False` because `1` is not less than `1`.
   - Since `i < n` is `False`, the entire condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` is `False`, meaning the loop will not execute again with the current values of `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To make the loop execute again, we need to change the states such that the condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` becomes `True`.
   - We can increase `n` to be greater than `i`, but since `i` is already 1, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`. However, since we don't have information about `word` or `func_1`, we can only ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `i < n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
