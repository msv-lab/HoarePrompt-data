Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original value of `i`.
   - `n` is the original value of `n`.
   - `result` is the initial state with an additional empty string appended.
   - `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `i < n` and `(not func_1(word[i]))` are true.
   - Since `i < n` is already true, we need to focus on the second condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` at the start of the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` when the loop checks the next element in the array.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to adjust the state such that `func_1(word[i])` still returns `False` at the start of the next iteration. This means `i` should be incremented by 1, but the values of `start`, `n`, and `result` remain the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `func_1(word[i])` must still return `False` at the start of the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `n` and incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` is the initial state with an additional empty string appended, and `func_1(word[i])` must return False**.
