The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `word`. `word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000. The function returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the list 'result' with a space between each element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a string `word` and return a string that concatenates all elements of the list 'result' with spaces between them.
