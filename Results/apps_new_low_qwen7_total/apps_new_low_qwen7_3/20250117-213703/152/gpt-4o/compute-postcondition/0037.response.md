The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The function `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the new value of `i`. Since the initial state of `word` is a non-empty string and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the new value of `i`, the output state remains that `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000 and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000 and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
