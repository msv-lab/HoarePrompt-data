The variables in the loop head are `start` and `i`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `start < i`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `start` must be less than `i`.

To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be greater than 1. Since no specific value for `i` is given, we can only state that `i` must be greater than 1.

State: **`start` is 1, `i` must be greater than 1**
