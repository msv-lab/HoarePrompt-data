The code appends a substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]` to the list `result`. Here, `start` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. However, since the exact value of `start` is not specified in the initial state and the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. The only changes are that `result` will have a new element appended to it.

Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, this condition still holds after the code execution. The `start` value, which is used to slice the string, will also follow the same condition.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), and `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.**
