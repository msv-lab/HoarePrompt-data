The code appends a substring of `word` from index `start` to index `i` (excluding `i`) to the list `result`. Given the conditions in the initial state, we know:

- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- Either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`.

Since `result` is a list, appending a new element to it does not change its nature as a list. The substring `word[start:i]` is added to `result`.

The conditions about `i` and `func_1` remain unchanged, and the condition about `func_2` and `i - start` also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing the substring `word[start:i]`, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`**
