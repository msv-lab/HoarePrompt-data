Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[0])`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:
     - `i < n` must be true.
     - `(not func_1(word[i]))` must be true.

4. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - To ensure `i < n` is true for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

5. **Ensuring `(not func_1(word[i]))` is True**:
   - We need to ensure that `word[2]` does not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `word`, we cannot guarantee this without additional information. However, we can ensure that `i` is set to 2 and rely on the condition to check `word[2]`.

6. **Other States**:
   - No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Increment `i` to 2.
- Ensure `n` remains greater than 0.
- Ensure `word[2]` does not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`.

**Final State**:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `word[2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`**
