Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < n \text{ and } (\text{not } \text{func\_1(word[i]))} \]

This means the loop continues as long as:
1. \( i < n \)
2. \( \text{func\_1(word[i])} \) returns `False`

### Current State at End of Previous Iteration
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `i` is 3.
- `word[2]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`.

### Conditions for Next Iteration
For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
1. \( i < n \)
2. \( \text{func\_1(word[i])} \) returns `False`

From the current state:
- \( i = 3 \)
- \( \text{word[2]} \) does not satisfy `func_1(word[2])`, meaning \( \text{func\_1(word[2])} \) returns `False`.

### Adjusting the State
To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. \( i \) must be incremented to 4 (since \( i \) was 3 in the last iteration).
2. \( i < n \) must still hold true, so \( n \) must be greater than 4.
3. \( \text{func\_1(word[4])} \) must return `False` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- \( i \) is adjusted to 4.
- \( n \) is adjusted to be greater than 4.
- \( \text{func\_1(word[4])} \) returns `False`.

### Final State
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 4, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `word[4]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[4])`**
