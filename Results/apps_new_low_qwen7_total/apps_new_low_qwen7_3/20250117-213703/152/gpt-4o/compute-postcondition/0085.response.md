The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`, the new value of `i` is one more than its previous value. However, since we don't know the exact initial value of `i`, we only know that the new value of `i` is still less than `n` and that `func_1(word[i])` will still return `True` for this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, which is still less than `n`; `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`**
