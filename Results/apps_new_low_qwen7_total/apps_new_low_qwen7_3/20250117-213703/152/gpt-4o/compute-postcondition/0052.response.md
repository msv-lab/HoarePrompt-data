The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state requires that `i < n` and the smallest possible value for `n` is 1, `i` must initially be 0 for the loop to execute the first time. After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 1. The conditions for the loop to continue executing are still valid because `i` is now 1, which is less than `n` (which is 1). Additionally, the condition `func_1(word[i])` must return true when `i` is the length of `word`, but this condition does not affect the value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1**
