`i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `i = 5`. The other variables (`word`, `n`, `result`, and `word[4]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 4, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `word[4]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[4])`**
