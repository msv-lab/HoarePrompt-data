Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.

2. **Analyze each condition in the loop head**:
   - `i < n`: This condition checks if `i` is less than `n`.
   - `(not func_1(word[i]))`: This condition checks if `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1.
   - `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`).
   - `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1.
   - `start` is equal to `i`.
   - `i < n` must be true.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied.
   - `i < n` must remain true.
   - `(not func_1(word[i]))` must be true.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1 and `start` is set to `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is still within the bounds and that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `i < n` remains true.
   - No changes are needed for `word`, `result`, and `start` since they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `n` must be greater than `i` (since `i` is increased by 1).
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than `i`, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, `start` is equal to `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.**
