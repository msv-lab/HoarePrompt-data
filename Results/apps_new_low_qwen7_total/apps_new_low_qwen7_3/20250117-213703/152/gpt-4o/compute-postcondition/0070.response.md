Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions**: The key variables here are `start` and `i`. The loop condition is `start < i`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 2.
   - `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`.
   - `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis**: For the loop `while start < i` to execute at least once, `start` must be less than `i`.

4. **Determine the Necessary State**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, we need to check the value of `start`.
   - Given `start` is the original value of `i` plus 2, and `i` is `n`, we can write `start` as `n + 2`.
   - To satisfy the loop condition `start < i` (or `start < n`), `n + 2` must be less than `n`, which is impossible.

Since `start` being `n + 2` will always make the condition `start < n` false, no adjustment to the states is necessary because the condition `start < i` cannot be satisfied under the given conditions.

Therefore, the only thing to note is that the current state does not allow the loop to execute even once.

**State**: **`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 2, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.**
