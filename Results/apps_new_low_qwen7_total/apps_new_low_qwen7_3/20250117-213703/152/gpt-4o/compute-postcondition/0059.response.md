Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is the original value of `n`.
   - `start` is equal to the original value of `i`.
   - `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue to execute if `i < n` is true.
   - Currently, `i` is equal to `n`, so `i < n` is false.
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.

Given that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute, and `n` is the original value of `n`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. `i` needs to be set to a value less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended.**
