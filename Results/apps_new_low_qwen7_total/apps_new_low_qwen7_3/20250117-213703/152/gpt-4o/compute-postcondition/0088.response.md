Let's analyze the given loop step by step and determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is the length of `word`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer While Loop:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

2. **Inner While Loop 1:**
   - This loop runs as long as `i < n` and `not func_1(word[i])`.
   - After this loop, `i` is set to the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `True` or `i` reaches `n`.

3. **If Condition:**
   - If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`:
     - `result` appends the substring `word[start:start + 2]`.
     - `start` is incremented by 2.
     - Another inner loop appends each character from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]` to `result`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `result` appends the substring `word[start:i]`.

4. **Inner While Loop 2:**
   - This loop runs as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])`.
   - After this loop, `i` is incremented to the next index where `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` or `i` reaches `n`.

5. **Final Append:**
   - `result` appends the substring `word[start:i]`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior:
- The loop processes substrings of `word` based on the conditions specified.
- `start` and `i` are updated within the loops.
- `result` accumulates substrings based on the conditions.

### Invariants:
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `i` eventually becomes `n` when the loop completes.

### Output State:
- When the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the outer while loop condition (`i < n`) will no longer be true.
- `start` will be equal to `n` because it is only incremented and never decremented.
- `result` will contain the processed substrings based on the conditions inside the loops.

### Final Output State:
- `word` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `start` is equal to `n`.
- `result` contains the processed substrings based on the conditions inside the loops.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is the original value of `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `n`, and `result` contains the processed substrings based on the conditions inside the loops.**
