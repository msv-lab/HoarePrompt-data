The initial state is that `word` is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. The code snippet initializes `n` to the length of `word`, creates an empty list `result`, and sets `i` to 0. However, no further operations are performed on these variables within the given code block. Therefore, the values of `word`, `n`, `result`, and `i` remain unchanged after executing the provided code.

Output State: **word is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000, n is the length of word, result is an empty list, i is 0**
