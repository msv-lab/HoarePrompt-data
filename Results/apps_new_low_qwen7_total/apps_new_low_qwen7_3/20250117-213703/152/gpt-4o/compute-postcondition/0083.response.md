The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` must be less than `n`, and `start` is `n-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

After executing the code, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`, which is still less than `n` since `i` was originally less than `n`. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `start` is `n-1`, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.**
