To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the loop head:

1. The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
2. We need to ensure both parts of this condition are true for the loop to continue.

From the given information:
- `i` is updated as `i + 1` at the end of each iteration.
- `n` is the original value of `n`.
- `start` is `n-1`.
- `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

Now, let's consider the loop condition:
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
- Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

Given that `i` is updated as `i + 1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value. Therefore, to satisfy `i < n`, the new value of `i` must still be less than `n`.

Since `func_1(word[i])` must return `True` for the loop to continue, the value of `word[i]` must satisfy the condition defined by `func_1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`.

Let's summarize this:

State: **`i` must be less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` must return `True`**
