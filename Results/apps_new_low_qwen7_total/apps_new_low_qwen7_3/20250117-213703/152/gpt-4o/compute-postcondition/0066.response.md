The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions that `i + 1 < n` must be satisfied and `start` is equal to the original value of `i`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The `result` variable has an additional empty string appended to it, making its length one more than before. The function call `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` has an additional empty string appended, and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.**
