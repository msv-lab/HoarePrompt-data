Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`. Additionally, if `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`, then `result` contains the slice `word[start:i]` instead.***
