Postcondition: ***`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. If `i - start >= 3` and `func_2(word[start:i])` is true, `result` contains the substring `word[start:i]`. Otherwise, either `i - start < 3` or `func_2(word[start:i])` is false, and `result` remains unchanged.***
