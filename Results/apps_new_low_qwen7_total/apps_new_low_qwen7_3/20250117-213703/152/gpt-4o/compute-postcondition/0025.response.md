`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was previously less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` returned `True`. After incrementing `i`, `i` is still less than `n` because it was already one less than `n` and now it is exactly one less. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is an index such that `i < n` and `func_1(word[i+1])` returns `True`**
