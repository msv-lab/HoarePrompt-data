Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n and (not func_1(word[i]))`.
   - `i < n`: This part checks if `i` is less than `n`.
   - `(not func_1(word[i]))`: This part checks if `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is greater than `i`.
   - `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-2]`).
   - `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1.
   - `start` is equal to `i`.
   - `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Loop to Execute One More Time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied.
     - `i < n`: We already know that `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1 and `n` is greater than `i`. Therefore, this condition is likely to be true unless there was a change in `n` or `i` that prevents it from being true.
     - `(not func_1(word[i]))`: We need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the new value of `i`.

4. **Ensuring `(not func_1(word[i]))`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to check the value of `word[i]` and ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `word` because the function `func_1` is applied to `word[i]` and we need to ensure that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Final Answer

State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000 and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for the new value of `i`**, `n` is greater than `i`, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-2]`), `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, `start` is equal to `i`.
