Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start < i`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `result` is a list containing two substrings: the original one and another substring from `word[i]` to `word[i+1]`.
   - `i` is the length of `word`.
   - `start` is `i + 2`.
   - `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.

3. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop `while start < i` to execute, the condition `start < i` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is the length of `word` and `start` is `i + 2`. Therefore, `start` is always `2` more than `i`, which means `start` will never be less than `i`.
   - This implies that the loop condition `start < i` will never be satisfied.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `start` becomes less than `i`. However, since `start` is set to `i + 2` and `i` is the length of `word`, `start` cannot be less than `i` based on the current setup.

Therefore, no modification to the given states is necessary to make the loop execute at least once because the loop condition will never be met under the given conditions.

**State:**
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is 0, `result` is a list containing two substrings: the original one and another substring from `word[i]` to `word[i+1]`, `i` is the length of `word`, `start` is `i + 2`, `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`**
