Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while start < i:`. Therefore, the variables that control the loop's continuation are `start` and `i`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `result` is `['h', 'i']`
   - `start` is `2`
   - `i` is greater than `1`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `start < i` must be true.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `start` is currently `2`.
   - `i` is greater than `1`, but we need to ensure that the loop can definitely execute one more time. Since `start` is `2`, `i` must be greater than `2` to satisfy the condition `start < i`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than `2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`result` is ['h', 'i'], `start` is 2, `i` must be greater than 2**
