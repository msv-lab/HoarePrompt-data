Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `start` is equal to the original value of `i`; `n` is the original value of `n`; `result` is a list of `(original_value_of_i + 1)` empty strings; and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False` for all `i` from `start` to `n-1`.

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - Initially, `i` is less than `n`, and `start` is equal to the original value of `i`.
   - `result` starts as the initial state with an additional empty string appended.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `start` remains constant and equals the original value of `i`.
   - `n` remains constant and equals the original value of `n`.
   - `result` grows by appending one empty string each time the loop runs.
   - `i` increases by 1 each iteration as long as `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop increments `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - If `i` reaches `n` without `func_1(word[i])` returning `True`, the loop stops.
   - `result` will have `n - start` empty strings because it starts with one empty string and appends one more each iteration.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - When the loop exits, `i` is either `n` or greater, but since we assume it stops when `i` reaches `n`, `i` equals `n`.
   - `start` remains the original value of `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` has `n - start` empty strings because it started with one empty string and added one each iteration.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is as described above.
