Postcondition: ***`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`. `start` is an index such that `i - start` is at least 3 and `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`.***
