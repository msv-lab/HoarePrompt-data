The only variables in the loop head are `start` and `i`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `start < i`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `start` must be less than `i`.

Therefore, `i` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`start` is 2, `i` must be greater than 2**
