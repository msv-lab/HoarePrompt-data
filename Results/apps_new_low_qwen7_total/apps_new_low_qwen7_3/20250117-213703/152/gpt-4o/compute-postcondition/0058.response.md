The code snippet `result.append(word[start:i])` appends a substring from `word` starting at index `start` and ending just before index `i` to the list `result`. However, the initial values of `start` and `i` are not specified in the initial state. We know that `i` is initially equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to the original value of `i` (which is `n`). Therefore, the code snippet effectively appends an empty string to `result` because the slice `word[start:i]` with `start == i` results in an empty string.

The variables `n`, `i`, and `start` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `result` is the same as the initial state with an additional empty string appended.**
