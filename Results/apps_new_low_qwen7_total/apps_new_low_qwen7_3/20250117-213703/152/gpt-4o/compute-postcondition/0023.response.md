The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which means that `i` now points to the next character in the string `word`. Since `i` was previously the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and given that `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, the new value of `i` will still satisfy this condition because we just incremented it by 1, and it was already pointing to a valid character. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.**
