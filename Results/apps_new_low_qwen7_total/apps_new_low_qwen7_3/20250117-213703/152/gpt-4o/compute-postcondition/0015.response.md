The initial state is that `start` is 1 and `i` must be greater than 1. However, there is no variable `i` used or modified in the provided code block, so its value remains unchanged. 

The code block consists of two lines:
1. `result.append(word[start:start + 1])`: This line appends the character at the current `start` index of the string `word` to the list `result`. Since `start` is 1, it appends `word[1]` to `result`.
2. `start += 1`: This line increments the value of `start` by 1.

Since the value of `word` is not provided, we can't determine the exact character that is appended to `result`. However, we know that `start` will be incremented to 2. 

Given the initial state where `start` is 1, after executing the code block, `start` will be 2, and `result` will contain the character at index 1 of `word`.

Output State: **start is 2, result is ['character_at_index_1_of_word']**
