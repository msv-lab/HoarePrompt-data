Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `start` is equal to `i + 2`.
   - `result` is a list of `(n - (i + 1))` empty strings with an additional element `'word[i+1:i+3]'` and one more element `'word[i+1:i+2]'`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while start < i`.

3. **Analysis of Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `start` must be less than `i`.
   - Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the loop condition simplifies to `start < n`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `start` is equal to `i + 2`, which means `start` is equal to `n + 2`.

5. **Determine Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `start` is currently `n + 2`, which is greater than `n` (because `i` equals `n`), the loop cannot execute again based on the current values.
   - Therefore, the only way to allow the loop to execute one more time is to decrease `start` to a value that is less than `n`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to adjust the value of `start` to be less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are the ones involving `start` so that the loop condition `start < i` can be satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to `i + 2` and must be less than `n`**, and `result` remains as initially described.
