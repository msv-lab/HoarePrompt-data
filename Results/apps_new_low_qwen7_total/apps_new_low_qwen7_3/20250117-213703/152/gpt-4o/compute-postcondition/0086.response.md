To determine the final output state after the loop has executed, let's follow the steps provided:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
- Initially, `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i` (`n`), `n` remains unchanged, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `n`: Remains unchanged.
  - `start`: Initially `n`, but it will not change within the loop.
- **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
  - `i`: Increases by 1 each time the condition `i < n and func_1(word[i])` is met.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop increments `i` while `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`.
- If `i` reaches `n` without satisfying `i < n` (i.e., `i == n`), the loop stops executing.
- Since the initial value of `i` is `n`, the loop will not execute even once unless there is a specific condition where `i` is less than `n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True` before reaching `n`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- From the given output states, we can see that the loop increments `i` each time it executes, and it only stops when `i` is no longer less than `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.

### Final Output State Calculation
Given that the initial value of `i` is `n` and the loop only increments `i` while `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` is `True`, and since `i` starts as `n`, the loop will never increment `i` because `i` is already equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop will not execute at all.

- **Final Values**:
  - `i`: Remains `n`.
  - `start`: Remains `n` (initial value of `i`).
  - `n`: Remains unchanged.
  - `result`: Since the loop does not execute, `result` remains as initially defined: a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`.

### Output State: **i is n, start is n, n is the original value of n, and result is a list of (n - start) empty strings plus the slice word[start:n].**
