To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < n and (not func_1(word[i])):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < n`
2. `not func_1(word[i])`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
- `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1.
- `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`).
- `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
- `start` is equal to `i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `i < n`:**
   - The current value of `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to start executing. Since `n` is initially greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, we can assume that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, if `i` is 0 (which is a valid starting point since `i` is the smallest index such that the condition holds), `i < n` would be true.

2. **Condition `(not func_1(word[i]))`:**
   - This condition checks if `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. Given that `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, it implies that `func_1(word[i])` returns `False` for the current value of `i`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be satisfied:
- `i < n` must be true.
- `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.

Given the state right before the loop, `i` is already defined as the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`. This means that `i` satisfies the second condition. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i < n` is true.

Since `n` is initially greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, the only constraint we need to adjust is ensuring `i < n`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`, `start` is equal to `i`, and `i < n` must be true.**
