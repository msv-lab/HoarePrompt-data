Let's analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it will execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element. Since `n` is 0, this means `result` is a list with an empty string.
   - `i` is the length of `word`.
   - `start` is equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n and func_1(word[i])`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the condition must be true:
     - `i < n`
     - `func_1(word[i])`

3. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `i < n`: Since `n` is 0 and `i` is the length of `word`, `i < n` is always false because `i` (length of `word`) is never less than 0.
   - Therefore, the only way for the loop to execute the first time is if `func_1(word[i])` evaluates to true when `i` is the length of `word`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To make the loop execute the first time, we need to set `n` to a value such that `i < n` holds true. The smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies this is 1.
   - Additionally, `func_1(word[i])` must return true when `i` is the length of `word`.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1, and `func_1(word[i])` must return true when `i` is the length of `word`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be at least 1, `result` is a list with an empty string, `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` is equal to `i`.**
