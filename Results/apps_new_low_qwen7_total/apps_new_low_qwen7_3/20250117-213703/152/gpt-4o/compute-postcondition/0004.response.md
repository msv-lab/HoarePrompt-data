The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[0])`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `word[0]` must not satisfy `func_1(word[0])`**
