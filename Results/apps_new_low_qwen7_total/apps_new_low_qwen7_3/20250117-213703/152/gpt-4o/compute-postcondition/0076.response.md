Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The initial state is provided as:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `start` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 2
- `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings with an additional element `'word[start:start + 2]'`
- `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True`

The loop is:
```python
while start < i:
    result.append(word[start:start + 1])
    start += 1
```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: 
  - `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `True` (this remains invariant because it is a condition that is checked at the beginning of each iteration, but not modified within the loop).

- **Variables changing during the loop**:
  - `start`: Increases by 1 in each iteration.
  - `result`: Appends one element per iteration (`word[start:start + 1]`).

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to execute as long as `start < i`. Since `i` is initially set to `n` and `start` is initially set to `n + 2`, the loop will run until `start` reaches `i`. 

After each iteration, `start` increases by 1, and `result` appends one more character from `word`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
Given the initial conditions:
- `i = n`
- `start = n + 2`
- `result` starts with `(n - (n + 2)) = -2` (which is not possible in practice, so likely a typo; we should consider the correct initial value of `start`)

For the loop to execute 1 time, `start` would be incremented once, making `start = n + 3` and `result` would have one additional element `word[n+2:n+3]`.

For the loop to execute 2 times, `start` would be incremented twice, making `start = n + 4` and `result` would have two additional elements `word[n+2:n+3]` and `word[n+3:n+4]`.

Continuing this pattern, after `k` iterations:
- `start` would be `n + 2 + k`
- `result` would contain `k + 1` elements, starting from `word[n+2:n+3]` up to `word[n+2+k:n+3+k]`

When `start` reaches `i`, the loop terminates. Given the final state after 3 iterations:
- `i = 5`
- `start = 7`

This implies the loop ran until `start` reached `i`, which means `start` was incremented 5 - (n + 2) = 3 times, confirming the loop ran 3 times.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs until `start` equals `i`, and given the final `start` value is `7` and `i` is `5`, there seems to be a discrepancy. Assuming the loop logic is correct and the final `start` value is indeed `7`, we can infer that `i` might be updated or redefined somewhere else in the code not shown here.

However, based on the given information and the loop's behavior, the final output state is:
- `i` remains `n` (since no updates are shown)
- `start` is `7`
- `result` contains `n - (n + 2 + (7 - (n + 2)))` elements, which simplifies to `7 - (n + 2) = 5` elements.

Output State: **i is equal to n, start is equal to 7, result is a list of 5 elements starting from word[n+2:n+3] up to word[6:7], func_2(word[start:i]) returns True.**
