State right before the while loop: The loop condition is `start < i`. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start < i` must be true.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is some initial value (let's denote it as `start_initial`).
- `i` is some initial value (let's denote it as `i_initial`).

To make the loop execute the first time, `start` must be less than `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `start` is less than `i`.

Since the exact values of `start_initial` and `i_initial` are not specified, we can only ensure that `start` is set to a value that is less than `i`.

State: **`start` must be less than `i`**
