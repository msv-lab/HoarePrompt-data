`result` appends the slice of `word` from `start` to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, and `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the slice `word[start:i]` is `word[start:n]`.

Since `func_2(word[start:i])` returns `False`, this fact is not relevant to the change in the variables. The only change is that `result` now contains one more element, which is the slice `word[start:n]`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the original value of `i`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `result` is a list of `(n - start)` empty strings plus the slice `word[start:n]`**
