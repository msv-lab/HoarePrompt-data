The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than `i`, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`), `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, `start` is equal to `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`. After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` changes, but the other variables remain in their respective conditions.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is greater than `i`, `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-2]`), `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, `start` is equal to `i`, and `func_1(word[i])` must return `False`.**
