Output State: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is 0, `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element, `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` is equal to `i`.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `result` is a list with one additional element (the substring from `word[start]` to `word[i-1]`).
   - `i` is the smallest index such that `i >= n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - `start` is equal to `i`.

2. **Tracking Variable Changes**:
   - The loop increments `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - `result` remains unchanged unless the loop modifies `i` and `start`.
   - `start` is updated to `i` each time the loop increments `i`.
   - `n` decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
   - `word` and `func_1` remain unchanged within the loop.

3. **Summarizing the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` and `func_1(word[i])` returns `False`.
   - Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1 and updates `start` to `i`.
   - The loop terminates when `i` equals `n` or `func_1(word[i])` returns `True`.
   - If the loop executes multiple times, it will increment `i` and update `start` accordingly.

4. **Final Values After All Iterations**:
   - When `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates because the condition `i < n` fails.
   - At this point, `i` will be the length of `word`, since `i` is incremented until it equals `n` (which is now 0).
   - `start` will also be equal to `i` (the length of `word`).
   - `result` contains the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]`, which is the empty substring because `n` is 0.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `word` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 3000, `n` is 0, `result` is a list with the substring from `word[start]` to `word[n-1]` as its only element, `i` is the length of `word`, and `start` is equal to `i`.
