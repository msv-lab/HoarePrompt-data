### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and the Given Code:**
   - The code needs to validate if Limak’s journey, as described by a series of moves, adheres to specific rules:
     - If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South.
     - If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North.
     - The journey must end on the North Pole.
   - The code initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
   - For each move, the latitude is updated based on the direction and distance.
   - If the latitude goes out of bounds (-90 to 90), or if there's an invalid move at the poles, the function prints "NO" and exits.
   - After processing all moves, the function checks if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly updates the latitude based on the direction and distance.
   - It checks if the latitude goes out of bounds, which ensures that Limak stays within the allowed range of the Earth's surface.
   - The condition checks for valid moves at the poles ensure that Limak only moves in the permitted directions from those points.
   - The final check at the end ensures that the journey ends at the North Pole.

3. **Validation Based on the Examples:**
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code:
     - In the first example, the journey ends at the North Pole, satisfying all conditions.
     - In the second example, the journey does not end at the North Pole, failing the last condition.
     - Other examples also match the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic required to validate Limak’s journey based on the specified rules.

**Correctness: **True**
