Reasoning:
The given program logic is designed to validate the movements of Limak based on the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Latitude**: The current latitude starts at 90 degrees, which corresponds to the North Pole.
2. **Processing Movements**: For each movement specified in the input:
   - The latitude is updated based on the direction and distance.
   - If the latitude goes out of the valid range [-90, 90], the program immediately prints 'NO'.
   - If Limak reaches -90 degrees and the next movement is not towards the North, the program prints 'NO'.
   - If Limak reaches 90 degrees and the next movement is not towards the South, the program prints 'NO'.
3. **Final Check**: After all movements have been processed, the program checks if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees (indicating the North Pole). If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This logic accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- Valid movements must keep Limak within the valid latitude range.
- Movements towards the South are only allowed if Limak is not already at the South Pole.
- Movements towards the North are only allowed if Limak is not already at the North Pole.
- The journey must end on the North Pole.

Given that the program follows these rules correctly and the execution summary accurately describes the behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
