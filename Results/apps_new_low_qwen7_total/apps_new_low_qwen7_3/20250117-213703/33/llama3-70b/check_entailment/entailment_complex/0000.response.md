Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole.
2. The program iterates over each movement, updating `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance provided.
3. The program checks for invalid states where `curr_lat` goes out of the valid range [-90, 90] or reaches the poles with an invalid direction. If any of these invalid states occur, it immediately prints 'NO' and exits.
4. After processing all movements, the program checks if the final `curr_lat` is exactly 90 (indicating the North Pole). If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the annotated program correctly implements the required logic to validate the conditions:
- If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South.
- If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North.
- The journey must end at the North Pole.

Based on the detailed reasoning, the annotated program meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
