Reasoning:

The given program aims to validate the conditions of Limak's journey based on the specified rules. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
2. **Loop Through Movements**: It iterates over each movement described in the input.
   - For each movement, it reads the distance (`t`) and the direction (`dir`).
   - If the direction is 'North', it updates the latitude by adding the distance divided by 111.195 (approximate conversion factor from kilometers to degrees latitude). Similarly, for 'South', it subtracts the distance divided by 111.195.
   - For directions other than 'North' and 'South' (i.e., 'West' and 'East'), it does not update the latitude and simply continues to the next iteration.
3. **Validation Conditions**:
   - If at any point, the latitude goes outside the valid range [-90, 90], it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - If Limak reaches the South Pole (-90), the next allowed movement is only 'North'.
   - If Limak reaches the North Pole (90), the next allowed movement is only 'South'.
   - After processing all movements, if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the conditions stated in the problem description. It ensures that Limak moves only towards the allowed directions at every step and checks the final position to see if it ends at the North Pole.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
