### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program against the provided problem description and the function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
1. **Starting Point**: Limak starts at the North Pole (latitude 90).
2. **Valid Moves**:
   - If at the North Pole, only 'South' moves are allowed.
   - If at the South Pole, only 'North' moves are allowed.
3. **Final Position**: The journey must end at the North Pole.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes the current latitude (`curr_lat`) to 90.
- It processes each movement by updating the latitude based on the direction and distance.
- It checks if the latitude goes out of bounds (-90 to 90) or if the direction is invalid for the current latitude.
- After processing all movements, it checks if the final latitude is 90 and prints the appropriate result.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Latitude Updates**: The latitude is updated correctly based on the direction and distance.
2. **Boundary Checks**: The program correctly handles boundary conditions for the latitude.
3. **Final Position Check**: The program ensures the final latitude is exactly 90.

#### Detailed Verification:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `curr_lat` is initialized to 90, which is correct for the North Pole.
   
2. **Movement Processing**:
   - For 'North' direction, the latitude is increased by \( \frac{t}{111.195} \).
   - For 'South' direction, the latitude is decreased by \( \frac{t}{111.195} \).
   - Other directions ('West' and 'East') do not change the latitude, which is correct as they do not affect the latitude.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - If the latitude exceeds -90 or 90, the program prints 'NO' and exits, which is correct.
   - If the latitude is -90, the next allowed move is only 'North'.
   - If the latitude is 90, the next allowed move is only 'South'.
   
4. **Final Position Check**:
   - After processing all movements, the program checks if the final latitude is 90 and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'. This is correct as per the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
