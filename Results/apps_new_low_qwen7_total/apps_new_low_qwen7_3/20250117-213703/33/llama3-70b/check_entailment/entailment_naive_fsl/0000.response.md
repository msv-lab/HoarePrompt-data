Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if Limak's journey adheres to the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting position at the North Pole.
2. **Loop through instructions**: It iterates through each instruction, updating the latitude (`curr_lat`) based on the direction (`dir`) and distance (`t`). The conversion factor `111.195` is used to convert kilometers to degrees (approximately).
3. **Boundary checks**: The program checks if the current latitude exceeds the limits (-90 to 90 degrees) after each move. If it does, it prints "NO" and exits.
4. **Pole restrictions**: When Limak reaches the South Pole (-90 degrees), the program ensures he only moves North. Similarly, when he reaches the North Pole (90 degrees), it ensures he only moves South.
5. **Final check**: After processing all instructions, the program checks if Limak ends up back at the North Pole (90 degrees). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles all the specified conditions accurately and does not allow invalid moves or positions. Therefore, it is correct for every potential case.
