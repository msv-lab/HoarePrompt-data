You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each i from 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())

curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `curr_lat` is 90.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of movements (each defined by a distance `t_i` and direction `dir_i`) starting from a latitude of 90 degrees. It updates the latitude based on the direction and distance of each movement. If at any point the latitude goes out of the valid range [-90, 90] degrees or reaches exactly -90 or 90 degrees with an invalid direction, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits. After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function implicitly accepts an integer `n` (the number of movements) and arrays of integers `t_i` and strings `dir_i` as inputs, even though these are not passed as parameters. Potential edge cases include reaching the boundary latitudes (-90 or 90) with directions other than "North" or "South", respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to validate the conditions of Limak's journey based on the specified rules. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
2. **Loop Through Movements**: It iterates over each movement described in the input.
   - For each movement, it reads the distance (`t`) and the direction (`dir`).
   - If the direction is 'North', it updates the latitude by adding the distance divided by 111.195 (approximate conversion factor from kilometers to degrees latitude). Similarly, for 'South', it subtracts the distance divided by 111.195.
   - For directions other than 'North' and 'South' (i.e., 'West' and 'East'), it does not update the latitude and simply continues to the next iteration.
3. **Validation Conditions**:
   - If at any point, the latitude goes outside the valid range [-90, 90], it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - If Limak reaches the South Pole (-90), the next allowed movement is only 'North'.
   - If Limak reaches the North Pole (90), the next allowed movement is only 'South'.
   - After processing all movements, if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the conditions stated in the problem description. It ensures that Limak moves only towards the allowed directions at every step and checks the final position to see if it ends at the North Pole.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
