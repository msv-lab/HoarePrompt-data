### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the program. However, there are a few subtle issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Latitude Conversion Factor**:
   - The program uses a fixed conversion factor of 111.195 to convert kilometers to degrees latitude. This approximation might not always be accurate, especially near the poles where the curvature of the Earth changes significantly. For the purposes of this problem, this approximation is acceptable, but it's worth noting.

2. **Direction Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the 'North' and 'South' directions by updating the latitude accordingly.
   - The directions 'West' and 'East' are ignored, which is correct as they do not change the latitude.
   
3. **Pole Boundary Checks**:
   - The program correctly checks if the latitude exceeds the valid range [-90, 90] and prints 'NO' if it does.
   - The program also correctly enforces the rule that if Limak reaches the North Pole, the next allowed movement is only 'South', and if he reaches the South Pole, the next allowed movement is only 'North'.

4. **Final Position Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the final latitude is exactly 90 (indicating the North Pole) and prints 'YES' if so; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: `curr_lat = 90` (starting at the North Pole).
- **Loop Through Movements**:
  - For each movement, the latitude is updated based on the direction.
  - The program correctly checks if the latitude goes out of bounds and prints 'NO' immediately if it does.
  - The program also checks if Limak reaches the South Pole and ensures the next allowed movement is only 'North'.
  - The program checks if Limak reaches the North Pole and ensures the next allowed movement is only 'South'.
- **Final Check**:
  - After processing all movements, the program checks if the final latitude is 90 and prints 'YES' if so; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the annotations and the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the conditions and performs the necessary checks to ensure Limak follows the specified rules.

**Final: True**
