### Reasoning:

The original assessment is almost correct, but there is a critical issue with the program's implementation that needs to be addressed.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
2. **Loop Through Movements**: It correctly processes each movement, updating the latitude based on the direction and ensuring that only 'North' or 'South' directions are allowed when the current latitude is 90 or -90, respectively.
3. **Validation Conditions**:
   - The condition `if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:` ensures that Limak stays within the valid range of latitudes.
   - The conditions `if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':` and `if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':` correctly enforce the rule that Limak can only move towards the opposite pole when he reaches either pole.
4. **Final Position Check**: The program correctly checks if the final latitude is 90 and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic of moving east or west. According to the problem statement, moving 'West' or 'East' should not change the latitude. Therefore, the current implementation where these directions do not update the latitude is correct. The issue lies in the original assessment's conclusion, which might have overlooked the fact that the latitude remains unchanged when moving east or west.

Given that the program correctly handles all the conditions as specified in the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
