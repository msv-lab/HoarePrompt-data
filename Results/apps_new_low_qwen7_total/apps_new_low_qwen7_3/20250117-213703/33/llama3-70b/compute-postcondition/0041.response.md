Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is unchanged** 

Explanation: The provided code consists of two lines. The first line prints 'NO' and does not affect any variables. The second line uses the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further lines. Therefore, the value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged from its initial state.
