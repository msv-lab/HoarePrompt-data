The given code consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`: This line prints the string 'NO' to the console.
2. `exit()`: This line terminates the program immediately after printing 'NO'.

Since the program exits after printing 'NO', no further actions are performed, and no variables are updated. Therefore, the values of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, curr_lat is either -90 if dir is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if dir is 'North', t is an integer**
