`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `t` remains an integer. The direction (`dir`) does not affect the calculation of `curr_lat` since the operation is independent of whether `dir` is 'North' or 'South'.

- If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` was already within the valid range (-90 to 90).
- If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` was set to -90 initially.

In both cases, `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`, and `t` is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`, and `t` is an integer.**
