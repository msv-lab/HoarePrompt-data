`curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer, and the initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. Since `curr_lat` must remain between -90 and 90 (as it represents latitude), if `t` is large enough, `curr_lat` could go below -90, but for now, we'll assume it remains within the valid range. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `curr_lat` is 90 - `t / 111.195`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string and is not 'North', and the current value of `dir` is 'South'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `curr_lat` is 90 - `t / 111.195`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string and is not 'North', and the current value of `dir` is 'South'**
