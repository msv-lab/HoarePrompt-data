The code updates `curr_lat` by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The initial state tells us that `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North'. Since `t` is an integer, `t / 111.195` will be a specific value. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Let's consider both cases for `curr_lat`:

1. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is -90.
   - After the code runs, `curr_lat` becomes `-90 + t / 111.195`.

2. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is within the valid range (-90 to 90).
   - After the code runs, `curr_lat` becomes `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.

Since `t` is an integer, `t / 111.195` will be a specific decimal value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is either -90 + `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'South', or `curr_lat` + `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North', `t` is an integer**
