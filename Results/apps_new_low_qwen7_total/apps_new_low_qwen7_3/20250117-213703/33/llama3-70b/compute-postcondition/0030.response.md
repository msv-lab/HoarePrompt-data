The provided code snippet includes a print statement followed by a call to the `exit()` function. Given the nature of these commands, they will terminate the program execution immediately without allowing any further code to run or any variables to be updated. Therefore, no modifications to the variables `n` or `curr_lat` can occur.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, curr_lat is adjusted according to the given conditions or remains unchanged if out of range, the program exits without further modification to variables**
