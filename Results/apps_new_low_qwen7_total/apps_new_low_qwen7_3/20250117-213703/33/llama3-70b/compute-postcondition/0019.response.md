The given code snippet consists of two lines that print 'NO' and then exit the program. Given the initial conditions, these lines will override the current state of the program because they halt its execution immediately. Therefore, no further variables can be updated, and the program's behavior is deterministic once it reaches these lines.

Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0 and `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North', and considering the condition that the program prints 'NO' and exits if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', this condition is not met (since the program simply exits without checking the condition). Thus, the program continues to print 'NO' and then exits, leaving no variables modified beyond their initial states.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, curr_lat is either -90 if dir is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if dir is 'North'**
