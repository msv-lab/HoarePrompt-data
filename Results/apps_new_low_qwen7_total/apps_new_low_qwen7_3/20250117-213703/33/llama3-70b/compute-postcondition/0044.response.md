Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` is an integer representing latitude. If `curr_lat` is -90, the state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged. If `dir` is not 'North', the state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated by increasing its value by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'curr_lat' is -90, the state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
