The initial state is defined as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North'

The code block is:
```
t, dir = input().split()
t = int(t)
```

Let's analyze the impact of each line:
1. `t, dir = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, storing the first part in `t` and the second part in `dir`.
2. `t = int(t)` converts the string value of `t` into an integer.

After these lines are executed, the following changes occur:
- `t` is now an integer value.
- `dir` is now a string value, which could be either 'North' or 'South'.

The value of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged because they were not affected by the executed code.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is greater than 0, curr_lat is either -90 if dir is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if dir is 'North', t is an integer**
