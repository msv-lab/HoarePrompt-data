The code prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Since `curr_lat` is 90 in the initial state, the condition `curr_lat == 90` evaluates to `True`, and 'YES' is printed. However, printing does not change the values of the variables, it only outputs the result. Therefore, the values of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `curr_lat` is 90**
