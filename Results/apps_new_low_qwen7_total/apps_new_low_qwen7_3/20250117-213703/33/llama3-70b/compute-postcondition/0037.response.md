`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`. The initial value of `t` is an integer, so `t / 111.195` will be a floating-point number. The value of `dir` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.**
