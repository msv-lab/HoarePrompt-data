The given code block contains an incomplete snippet, specifically it ends abruptly without defining the directions or processing the input values for `t_i` and `dir_i`. However, based on the provided initial state and the executed lines, we can still determine the final state of the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `curr_lat` is set to 90.

### Code Snippet:
```python
n = int(input())
curr_lat = 90
```

### Analysis:
1. The first line `n = int(input())` reads an integer value from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`.
2. The second line `curr_lat = 90` sets the variable `curr_lat` to the value 90.

Since the rest of the code is missing (specifically the parts involving `t_i` and `dir_i`), no further changes to `curr_lat` or any other variables are made. Therefore, the final state remains as follows:

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and equals the integer input from the user.
- `curr_lat` is 90.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and equals the input integer, curr_lat is 90**
