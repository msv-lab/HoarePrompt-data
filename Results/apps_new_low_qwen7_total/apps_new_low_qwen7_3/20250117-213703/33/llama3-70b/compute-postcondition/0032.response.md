The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines are executed in sequence. The first line prints 'NO' to the console, and the second line exits the program immediately without further execution.

Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 0 and `curr_lat` is adjusted according to certain conditions (which are not present in the current code), these conditions cannot be applied since they are not defined in this code block.

Since no variables are modified within the provided code block, the values of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is greater than 0, curr_lat is adjusted according to the given conditions or remains unchanged if out of range.**
