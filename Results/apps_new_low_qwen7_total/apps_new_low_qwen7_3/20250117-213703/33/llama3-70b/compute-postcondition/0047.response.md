Output State: **`n` is 0, `curr_lat` is 90.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The initial state has `n` as an integer between 1 and 50, and `curr_lat` is 90.
   - The loop runs `n` times based on the input value of `n`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **`n`**: The number of iterations in the loop. This variable is initially set but does not change during the loop.
   - **`curr_lat`**: Adjusted based on the direction (`North` or `South`) and distance (`t`) provided in each iteration.
   - **`t` and `dir`**: These variables are used inside the loop and reset with each iteration. They do not affect the final state of `curr_lat` once the loop is done.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to execute until `n` iterations are completed.
   - For each iteration, `curr_lat` is updated by adding or subtracting `t / 111.195` based on the direction (`North` or `South`).
   - The loop checks if `curr_lat` is out of the valid range (-90 to 90). If it is, the program prints "NO" and exits.
   - Additionally, if `curr_lat` becomes -90 and the direction is not 'North', or if `curr_lat` becomes 90 and the direction is not 'South', the program also prints "NO" and exits.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `n` is 0), then `curr_lat` remains at its initial value of 90.
   - If the loop executes, `curr_lat` will be adjusted according to the directions and distances provided in the inputs, but if the conditions for printing "NO" are met at any point, the loop will terminate early.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, the only scenario where the loop would not execute is when `n` is 0. In this case, `curr_lat` remains 90. Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 0, `curr_lat` is 90.**
