Functionality: **The function processes a series of movements (each defined by a distance `t_i` and direction `dir_i`) starting from a latitude of 90 degrees. It updates the latitude based on the direction and distance of each movement. If at any point the latitude goes out of the valid range [-90, 90] degrees or reaches exactly -90 or 90 degrees with an invalid direction, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits. After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function implicitly accepts an integer `n` (the number of movements) and arrays of integers `t_i` and strings `dir_i` as inputs, even though these are not passed as parameters. Potential edge cases include reaching the boundary latitudes (-90 or 90) with directions other than "North" or "South", respectively.**
