The initial state is defined such that `n` must be greater than 0 and `curr_lat` is 90. The provided code block takes an input which is split into two parts, assigning the integer part to `t` and the string part to `dir`. However, the value of `n` and `curr_lat` are not used or changed within this code block, and there are no further assignments or operations affecting them.

Here is the analysis of the code execution:

1. `t, dir = input().split()`: This line reads input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `t` and `dir` respectively. The value of `t` is converted to an integer.
2. `t = int(t)`: This line ensures that `t` is stored as an integer. It doesn't affect the value of `n` or `curr_lat`.

Since `n` and `curr_lat` are not used or modified in the provided code, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **n must be greater than 0, curr_lat is 90, t is an integer, dir is a string**
