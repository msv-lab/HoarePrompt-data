Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `curr_lat` is either `90 + t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North' or `90 - t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'South', `t` is an integer, and `dir` is either 'North' or 'South'. `curr_lat` is outside the valid range (-90 to 90), meaning `curr_lat < -90` or `curr_lat > 90`.***
