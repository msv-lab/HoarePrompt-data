The provided code snippet reads two values from input, where the first value is converted to an integer and assigned to `t`, and the second value is assigned to `dir`. However, the initial values of `curr_lat` and `n` are not changed by this code block. Therefore, the only modifications are to the variables `t` and `dir`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` itself is not affected by the code).
- `curr_lat` is adjusted according to given conditions or remains unchanged if out of range (though `curr_lat` itself is not affected by the code).
- `dir` remains unchanged (this statement might imply that `dir` was already set to some value before this code).

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `t` is assigned the integer value of the first input.
- `dir` is assigned the string value of the second input.

Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, we can only represent the final state in terms of these new values.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string**
