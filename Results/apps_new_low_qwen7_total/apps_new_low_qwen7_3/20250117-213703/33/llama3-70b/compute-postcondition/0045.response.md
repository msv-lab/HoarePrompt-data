The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines do not modify any of the variables (`t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`). Instead, they print 'NO' and then terminate the program immediately without allowing any further execution.

Given that no variables are modified and the initial state remains unaffected, the output state will be the same as the initial state provided:

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is an integer representing latitude**
