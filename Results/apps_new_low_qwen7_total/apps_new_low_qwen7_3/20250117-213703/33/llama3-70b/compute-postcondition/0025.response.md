The `continue` statement in this context does not modify any variable values; it only skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop. Given that no loop was explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North', `t` is an integer**
