Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(n):`.
   - There are no explicitly named variables within the loop header. However, the loop counter (though unnamed) is initialized to 0 and incremented with each iteration.
   - The variable `n` is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Condition for the First Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The loop counter starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, so the first iteration occurs when the loop counter reaches 1.

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - Initially, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - The value of `curr_lat` is 90.

4. **State at the Start of the Loop:**
   - Since the loop counter is not explicitly named but starts from 0, the condition for the first execution of the loop is that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - No changes are needed to `curr_lat` since it is not involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the loop must be:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `curr_lat` remains 90.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `curr_lat` is 90**
