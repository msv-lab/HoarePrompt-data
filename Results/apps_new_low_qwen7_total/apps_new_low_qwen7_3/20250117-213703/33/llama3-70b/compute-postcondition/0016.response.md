The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

These lines are executed sequentially. 

- The first line prints "NO" to the console.
- The second line terminates the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent code.

Since the program is terminated by `exit()` after printing "NO", no further modifications to the variables occur. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not directly used or modified in this code block).
- `curr_lat` is -90 (as it is initially set to `90 - t / 111.195` when `dir` is 'South' and `t` is an integer, and `dir` is confirmed to be 'South').
- `dir` is not 'North' (which aligns with the condition that `dir` is 'South').

The final output state remains the same as the initial state because no variables are altered within the code block. 

Output State: **n must be greater than 0, curr_lat is -90, dir is 'South'**
