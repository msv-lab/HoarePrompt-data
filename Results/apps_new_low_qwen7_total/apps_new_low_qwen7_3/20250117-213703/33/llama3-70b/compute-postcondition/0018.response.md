Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North'. The program prints 'NO' and exits if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'. Otherwise, the program continues with `curr_lat` being 90 and `dir` not equal to 'South'.**
