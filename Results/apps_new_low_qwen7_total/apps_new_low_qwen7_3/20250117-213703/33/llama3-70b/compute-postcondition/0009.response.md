The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided in the code snippet, the variables `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. The precondition that `dir` is not 'South' is also preserved.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string and `dir` is not 'South'**
