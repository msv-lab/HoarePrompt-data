Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the given conditions or remains unchanged if out of range. Specifically, if `curr_lat` is exactly 90 and `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`, and if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`.***
