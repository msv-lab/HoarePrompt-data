The given code snippet contains two lines:

1. `print('NO')`
2. `exit()`

The first line prints 'NO' to the console, but this does not affect any variables. The second line terminates the program immediately, preventing any further execution of subsequent lines. As a result, no variables are updated or affected by the code.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` is updated according to the direction `dir` (if within the specified range), the code execution is halted without making any changes to these variables.

Output State: **t is an integer, dir is a string, curr_lat is unchanged**
