The code `curr_lat += t / 111.195` updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. Given the initial state where `curr_lat` is 90 and `t` is an integer, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the string 'North'**
