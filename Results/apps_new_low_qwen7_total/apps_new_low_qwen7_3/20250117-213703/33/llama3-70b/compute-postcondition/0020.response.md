Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is either -90 if `dir` is 'South', or within the valid range (-90 to 90) if `dir` is 'North'. If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the program prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
