Output State: **n must be greater than 0, curr_lat is outside the valid range (-90 to 90), t is an integer, dir is either 'North' or 'South', the program prints 'NO' and exits**
Explanation: The provided code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement followed by an `exit()` function call. This means the program will print 'NO' and then terminate immediately without allowing any further execution of the code or modification of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the program's termination causes no additional state changes.
