Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` is updated according to the direction `dir`. If `curr_lat` is out of the range (-90, 90), the state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction: increased by `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North', and decreased by `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'South'. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
