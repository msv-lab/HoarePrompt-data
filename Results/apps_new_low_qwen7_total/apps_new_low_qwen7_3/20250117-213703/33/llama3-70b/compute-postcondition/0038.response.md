The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop context provided, so the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `t` and `dir`. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `dir` is a string**
