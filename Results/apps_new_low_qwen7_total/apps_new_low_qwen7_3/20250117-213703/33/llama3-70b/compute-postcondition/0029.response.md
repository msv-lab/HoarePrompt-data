Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the given conditions. If `curr_lat` is outside the range (-90 to 90), the function does nothing (i.e., `curr_lat` remains unchanged). Otherwise, if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`, and if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`.***
