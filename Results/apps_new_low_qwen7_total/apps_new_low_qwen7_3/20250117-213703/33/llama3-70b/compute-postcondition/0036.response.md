`curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer, but the exact value is not specified. The value of `dir` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`**
