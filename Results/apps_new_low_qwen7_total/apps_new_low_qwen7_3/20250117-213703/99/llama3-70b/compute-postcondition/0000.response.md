The given code block takes three pairs of positive integers as input, which are then assigned to variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3`. However, the code itself does not perform any operations or modifications to these variables. It simply reads the input and stores it in the specified variables.

Since no operations are performed on the variables within the provided code block, the values of `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` will remain the same as the input values. 

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **a1 is a positive integer, b1 is a positive integer, a2 is a positive integer, b2 is a positive integer, a3 is a positive integer, b3 is a positive integer**
