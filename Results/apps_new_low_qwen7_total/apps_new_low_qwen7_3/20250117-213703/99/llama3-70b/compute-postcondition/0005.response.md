The print statement 'NO' does not affect any variables; it only outputs text to the console. The initial conditions regarding the maximum and minimum values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`a1` is a positive integer, `b1` is a positive integer, `a2` is a positive integer, `b2` is a positive integer, `a3` is a positive integer, `b3` is a positive integer. The maximum of `a1` and `b1` is less than the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, or the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is less than the minimum of `a3` and `b3`.**
