The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' but does not change any of the variables' values. The conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **a1 is a positive integer, b1 is a positive integer, a2 is a positive integer, b2 is a positive integer, a3 is a positive integer, b3 is a positive integer. The maximum of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, or the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`; 'NO' is printed.**
