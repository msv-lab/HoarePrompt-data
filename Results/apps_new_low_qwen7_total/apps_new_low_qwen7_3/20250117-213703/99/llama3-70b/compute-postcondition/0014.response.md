The function `func` accepts four parameters: `a_1`, `b_1`, `a_2`, and `b_2`. All parameters are positive integers representing the dimensions of a board and two paintings, respectively, and they fit into the range from 1 to 1000. The function does not have any direct return values described in the problem statement, but rather describes conditions under which certain outputs may occur based on the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters: `a_1`, `b_1`, `a_2`, and `b_2`, where all parameters are positive integers representing the dimensions of a board and two paintings, and return based on specific conditions (though no explicit return values are provided in the problem statement).
