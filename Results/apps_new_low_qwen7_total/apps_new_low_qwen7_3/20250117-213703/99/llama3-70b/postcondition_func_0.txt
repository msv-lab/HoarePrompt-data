The function accepts four parameters \(a_1\), \(b_1\), \(a_2\), and \(b_2\) which represent the dimensions of a board and two paintings, respectively. It checks if the board can accommodate both paintings based on their dimensions. Specifically, the function determines if the board's dimensions can satisfy the dimensions of either of the two paintings. If the board can fit both paintings according to the specified conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input variables and only outputs a string based on the comparison results. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the dimensions of the board and paintings are within the range of 1 to 1000.
2. If the board dimensions are larger than or equal to the maximum and minimum dimensions of both paintings.
If neither condition is met, the function prints 'NO'.
