### Reasoning:
1. **Board and Painting Dimensions:**
   - The board dimensions are given as \(a_1 \times b_1\).
   - Each painting dimension is given as \(a_2 \times b_2\) and \(a_3 \times b_3\).

2. **Placement Conditions:**
   - One side of the board and each painting must be parallel to the floor.
   - Paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board but cannot overlap or go beyond the boardâ€™s edges.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program checks if the board can accommodate both paintings without overlap:
     - It compares the dimensions of the board with the maximum and minimum dimensions of the paintings.
     - The logic assumes the board can hold a painting if its largest dimension (either \(a_i\) or \(b_i\)) is greater than or equal to the largest dimension of the painting, and its smallest dimension is greater than or equal to the smallest dimension of the painting.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks for the placement of both paintings separately:
     - First, it tries to place the first painting.
     - If the first painting fits, it then tries to place the second painting.
     - If neither painting fits individually, it returns "NO".

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly checks all necessary conditions for placing both paintings on the board without overlap.
   - The program handles all possible orientations of the paintings correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the paintings can be placed on the board without overlapping. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
