You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then the output is `YES`. Otherwise, the program does not perform any specific action, but maintains the initial conditions of the variables.

Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

Otherwise, the output is `NO`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters \(a_1\), \(b_1\), \(a_2\), and \(b_2\) which represent the dimensions of a board and two paintings, respectively. It checks if the board can accommodate both paintings based on their dimensions. Specifically, the function determines if the board's dimensions can satisfy the dimensions of either of the two paintings. If the board can fit both paintings according to the specified conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input variables and only outputs a string based on the comparison results. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the dimensions of the board and paintings are within the range of 1 to 1000.
2. If the board dimensions are larger than or equal to the maximum and minimum dimensions of both paintings.
If neither condition is met, the function prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not cover all possible cases where the paintings can be placed on the board. Specifically, the program only checks if the larger dimension of the board can accommodate the larger dimensions of both paintings and the smaller dimension of the board can accommodate the smaller dimensions of both paintings. However, it does not account for cases where the paintings can be rotated to fit within the dimensions of the board.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
3 2
2 4
```

In this case, the board is 5x5, and the paintings are 3x2 and 2x4. If we rotate the second painting such that its dimensions become 4x2, we can fit both paintings on the board as follows:

- Place the first painting (3x2) vertically.
- Place the second painting (4x2) horizontally next to it, with its 4 units aligned along the width of the board.

However, the current program would incorrectly output "NO" because it does not check the rotated orientation of the second painting.

To fix this, the program should check all possible orientations of both paintings to ensure they can fit within the board dimensions.
