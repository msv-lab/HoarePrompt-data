You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

- Program:
def func():
    (a1, b1) = map(int, input().split())
    (a2, b2) = map(int, input().split())
    (a3, b3) = map(int, input().split())
    if max(a1, b1) >= max(a2, b2) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a2, b2):
        if max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters \(a_1\), \(b_1\), \(a_2\), and \(b_2\) which represent the dimensions of a board and two paintings, respectively. It checks if the board can accommodate both paintings based on their dimensions. Specifically, the function determines if the board's dimensions can satisfy the dimensions of either of the two paintings. If the board can fit both paintings according to the specified conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input variables and only outputs a string based on the comparison results. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the dimensions of the board and paintings are within the range of 1 to 1000.
2. If the board dimensions are larger than or equal to the maximum and minimum dimensions of both paintings.
If neither condition is met, the function prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Board and Painting Dimensions:**
   - The board dimensions are given as \(a_1 \times b_1\).
   - Each painting dimension is given as \(a_2 \times b_2\) and \(a_3 \times b_3\).

2. **Placement Conditions:**
   - One side of the board and each painting must be parallel to the floor.
   - Paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board but cannot overlap or go beyond the board’s edges.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program checks if the board can accommodate both paintings without overlap:
     - It compares the dimensions of the board with the maximum and minimum dimensions of the paintings.
     - The logic assumes the board can hold a painting if its largest dimension (either \(a_i\) or \(b_i\)) is greater than or equal to the largest dimension of the painting, and its smallest dimension is greater than or equal to the smallest dimension of the painting.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks for the placement of both paintings separately:
     - First, it tries to place the first painting.
     - If the first painting fits, it then tries to place the second painting.
     - If neither painting fits individually, it returns "NO".

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly checks all necessary conditions for placing both paintings on the board without overlap.
   - The program handles all possible orientations of the paintings correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the paintings can be placed on the board without overlapping. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
