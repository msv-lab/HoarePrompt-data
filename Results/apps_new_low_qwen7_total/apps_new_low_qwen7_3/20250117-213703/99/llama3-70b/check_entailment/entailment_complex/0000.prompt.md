Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1 and b_1 are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board, and a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3 are positive integers representing the dimensions of the two paintings, all fitting into the range from 1 to 1000.
def func():
    a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())

a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())

a3, b3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (max(a1, b1) >= max(a2, b2) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a2, b2)) :
        if (max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3)) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a1` is a positive integer, `b1` is a positive integer, `a2` is a positive integer, `b2` is a positive integer, `a3` is a positive integer, `b3` is a positive integer. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then the output is `YES`. Otherwise, the program does not perform any specific action, but maintains the initial conditions of the variables.
    else :
        if (max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3)) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are positive integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then no specific changes are made. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are positive integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then the output is `YES`. Otherwise, the output is `NO`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters \(a_1\), \(b_1\), \(a_2\), and \(b_2\) which represent the dimensions of a board and two paintings, respectively. It checks if the board can accommodate both paintings based on their dimensions. Specifically, the function determines if the board's dimensions can satisfy the dimensions of either of the two paintings. If the board can fit both paintings according to the specified conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input variables and only outputs a string based on the comparison results. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If the dimensions of the board and paintings are within the range of 1 to 1000.
2. If the board dimensions are larger than or equal to the maximum and minimum dimensions of both paintings.
If neither condition is met, the function prints 'NO'.
