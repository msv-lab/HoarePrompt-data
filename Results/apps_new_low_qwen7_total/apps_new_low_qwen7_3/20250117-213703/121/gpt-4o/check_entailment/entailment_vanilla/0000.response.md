Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` reads the input data correctly, splits it into `n` and `s`, and checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct based on the problem statement.

2. It then calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which is `n // 4`.

3. The program iterates over the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. This step is necessary to ensure we know how many of each nucleotide are already present.

4. After counting, the program checks if any nucleotide already has more than the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns, as per the problem statement.

5. If the counts are valid, the program proceeds to replace the '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotides to make the counts equal. It does this by iterating over the string again, checking for '?' characters, and replacing them with the least used nucleotide among 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

6. The replacement is done by checking the current counts and selecting the nucleotide that needs more instances. This ensures that the final genome has an equal number of each type of nucleotide.

Given that the logic follows the problem description accurately, handles all edge cases (like invalid genome lengths), and performs the required operations to decode the genome or detect impossibility, the provided code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
