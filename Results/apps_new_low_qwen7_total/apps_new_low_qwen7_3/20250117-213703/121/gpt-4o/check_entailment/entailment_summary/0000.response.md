Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly handles the edge case where the length of the genome \( n \) is not divisible by 4 by printing "===" and exiting early.
- It calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which is \( n // 4 \).
- The program iterates through the string \( s \) to count the occurrences of each nucleotide and checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the target count. If so, it prints "===" and exits.
- If the initial check passes, the program proceeds to replace all '?' characters with nucleotides in lexicographical order ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). This ensures that the nucleotides are replaced in a way that balances the count of each type.
- The program then prints the modified string.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
