You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) from standard input, where \( n \) represents the length of the genome and \( s \) consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4, and if not, it prints '===' and exits. If \( n \) is divisible by 4, it calculates the target count of each nucleotide as \( n // 4 \). It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in \( s \). If any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count, it prints '===' and exits. If not, it replaces all '?' characters in \( s \) with the nucleotides in lexicographical order ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that each nucleotide appears exactly the target count or \( n // 4 + 1 \) times. Finally, it prints the modified string. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` reads the input data correctly, splits it into `n` and `s`, and checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct based on the problem statement.

2. It then calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which is `n // 4`.

3. The program iterates over the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. This step is necessary to ensure we know how many of each nucleotide are already present.

4. After counting, the program checks if any nucleotide already has more than the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns, as per the problem statement.

5. If the counts are valid, the program proceeds to replace the '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotides to make the counts equal. It does this by iterating over the string again, checking for '?' characters, and replacing them with the least used nucleotide among 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

6. The replacement is done by checking the current counts and selecting the nucleotide that needs more instances. This ensures that the final genome has an equal number of each type of nucleotide.

Given that the logic follows the problem description accurately, handles all edge cases (like invalid genome lengths), and performs the required operations to decode the genome or detect impossibility, the provided code is correct.
