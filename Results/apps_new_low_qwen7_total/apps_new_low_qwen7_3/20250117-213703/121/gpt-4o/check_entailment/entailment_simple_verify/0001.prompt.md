You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. However, the input is provided through standard input, where the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `n % 4 == 0`
    target_count = n // 4

counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'` where the count of each character (either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') in `s` is incremented by 1, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:

The loop continues iterating through the keys in the `counts` dictionary in lexicographical order until it finds a key `char` such that `counts[char] > target_count`. If no such key is found, the function does not return and `counts` remains unchanged. If such a key is found, the function prints '===' and returns None.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and each key has a count of exactly `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1`. The `result` array is a list of length `n` where each index contains one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and every nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1` times in `result`. If `result[i]` is not '?', the postcondition remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The loop terminates when the count of all nucleotides in `counts` reaches their target count (`n // 4 + 1`), ensuring that each nucleotide type appears the required number of times in `result`.
    print(''.join(result))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` reads the input data correctly, splits it into `n` and `s`, and checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct based on the problem statement.

2. It then calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which is `n // 4`.

3. The program iterates over the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. This step is necessary to ensure we know how many of each nucleotide are already present.

4. After counting, the program checks if any nucleotide already has more than the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns, as per the problem statement.

5. If the counts are valid, the program proceeds to replace the '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotides to make the counts equal. It does this by iterating over the string again, checking for '?' characters, and replacing them with the least used nucleotide among 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

6. The replacement is done by checking the current counts and selecting the nucleotide that needs more instances. This ensures that the final genome has an equal number of each type of nucleotide.

Given that the logic follows the problem description accurately, handles all edge cases (like invalid genome lengths), and performs the required operations to decode the genome or detect impossibility, the provided code is correct.
