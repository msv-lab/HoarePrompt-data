Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the input data correctly, splits it into `n` and `s`, and checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns immediately, which is correct based on the problem statement.

2. **Target Count Calculation**: The program calculates the target count of each nucleotide type, which is `n // 4`. This is accurate and essential for determining the required number of each nucleotide.

3. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program iterates over the string `s` to count the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. This step is necessary to ensure we know how many of each nucleotide are already present. The annotations correctly describe this part of the code.

4. **Validation of Counts**: After counting, the program checks if any nucleotide already has more than the target count. If so, it prints "===" and returns, as per the problem statement. The annotations correctly reflect this check.

5. **Replacement Logic**: The program proceeds to replace the '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotides to make the counts equal. It does this by iterating over the string again, checking for '?' characters, and replacing them with the least used nucleotide among 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The annotations correctly describe this part of the code.

6. **Ensuring Equal Distribution**: The replacement is done by checking the current counts and selecting the nucleotide that needs more instances. This ensures that the final genome has an equal number of each type of nucleotide. The annotations correctly reflect this logic.

Upon reviewing the code against the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all cases, including invalid genome lengths and the possibility of multiple valid solutions or impossibility.

Final: **True**
