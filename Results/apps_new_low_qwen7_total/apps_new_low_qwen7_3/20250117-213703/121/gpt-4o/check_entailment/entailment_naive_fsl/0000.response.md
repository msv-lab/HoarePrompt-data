Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial count of nucleotides already exceeds the target count. For example, consider the input:

```
8
AGCCGTT?
```

- The target count of each nucleotide is 2.
- The initial counts are: `A: 1`, `C: 2`, `G: 1`, `T: 2`.
- The question mark at the end needs to be replaced, but since `C` already has 2 occurrences, replacing it would make it 3, which is more than the target count.

The program does not check if any nucleotide already exceeds the target count before attempting to replace question marks. Therefore, it will incorrectly replace the question mark, leading to an invalid genome.
