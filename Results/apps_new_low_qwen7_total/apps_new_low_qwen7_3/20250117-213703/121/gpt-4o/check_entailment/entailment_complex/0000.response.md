Reasoning:
- The function reads the input values for `n` and `s` from standard input.
- It first checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns, which is correct because the number of nucleotides of each type must be equal.
- If `n` is divisible by 4, it calculates the target count for each nucleotide as `n // 4`.
- It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in `s` and checks if any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count. If any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count, it prints '===' and returns, which is correct because the nucleotide counts must be balanced.
- If all nucleotide counts do not exceed the target count, it proceeds to replace the '?' characters in `s` with the appropriate nucleotides to ensure each nucleotide appears either `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1` times. The replacement logic ensures that the counts remain balanced and each nucleotide type is used appropriately.
- Finally, it prints the modified string.

The overall logic of the function is correct and should handle all the given test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
