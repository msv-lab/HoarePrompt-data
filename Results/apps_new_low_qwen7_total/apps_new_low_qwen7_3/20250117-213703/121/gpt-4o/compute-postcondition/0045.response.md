Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`. If `result[i]` equals `'?'`, then `counts['A']`, `counts['C']`, `counts['G']`, and `counts['T']` are adjusted accordingly so that the total count of each character matches `target_count`, and `i` is incremented. If `result[i]` does not equal `'?'`, no changes are made to `counts` and `i` remains unchanged.***
