Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and each key has a count of either `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1`. The `result` array contains at least one character from each of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Additionally, if `result[i]` is not '?', the postcondition remains unchanged.***
