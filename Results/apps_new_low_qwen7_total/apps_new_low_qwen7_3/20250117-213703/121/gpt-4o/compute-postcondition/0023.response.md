The code `print('===')` simply prints the string '===' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255; `s` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?'; `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`; `char` is one of the remaining keys in the `counts` dictionary (initially could be `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T''); the string '===' is printed to the console.**
