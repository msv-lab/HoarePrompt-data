Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that has at least one character, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, where the count of the character `char` is incremented by 1, and `target_count` is `n // 4`. If `char` is in `counts`, the count of `char` is incremented by 1. If `char` is not in `counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
