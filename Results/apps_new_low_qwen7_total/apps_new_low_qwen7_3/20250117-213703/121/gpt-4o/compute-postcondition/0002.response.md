The code simply prints '===', which does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `s`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and the current value of `n` is not divisible by 4**
