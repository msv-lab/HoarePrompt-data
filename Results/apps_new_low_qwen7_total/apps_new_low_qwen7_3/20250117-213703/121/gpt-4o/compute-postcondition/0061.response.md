Postcondition: **`counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and each key has a count of either `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1`. The loop starts with the first key in the dictionary, which could be any of `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`. The current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`**
