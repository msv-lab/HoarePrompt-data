Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the keys are 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and the values represent the count of each nucleotide. If the count of `char` (which must be one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') is less than 5, then the count of `char` in `counts` is set to 5. Otherwise, the original state of `counts` remains unchanged.***
