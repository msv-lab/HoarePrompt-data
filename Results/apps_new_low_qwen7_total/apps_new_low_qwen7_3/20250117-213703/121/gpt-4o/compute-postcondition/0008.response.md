`counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The value of `char` is present in the `counts` dictionary, so the specific count for that character in `counts` will increase by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least one character, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and their values initialized to 0, and `target_count` is `n // 4` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least one character, `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts[char]` is 1 more than its original value.**
