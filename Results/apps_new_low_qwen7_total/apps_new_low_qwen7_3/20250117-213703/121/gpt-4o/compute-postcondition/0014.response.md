`counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The value of `char` is the first character of the previous `s`. The length of `s` is `n-1`, and since `s` is a string of length `n-1`, removing the first character leaves us with a string of length `n-2`. The value of `target_count` remains `n // 4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'` where the count of the character `char` (the first character of the previous `s`) is incremented by 1, `target_count` is still `n // 4`.**
