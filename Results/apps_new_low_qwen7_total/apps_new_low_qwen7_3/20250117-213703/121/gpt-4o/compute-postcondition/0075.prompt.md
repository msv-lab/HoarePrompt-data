You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. However, the input is provided through standard input, where the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `n % 4 == 0`
    target_count = n // 4

counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'` where the count of each character (either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') in `s` is incremented by 1, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`. The loop continues iterating through the keys in the `counts` dictionary in lexicographical order until it finds a key `char` such that `counts[char] > target_count`. If no such key is found, the function does not return and `counts` remains unchanged. If such a key is found, the function prints '===' and returns None.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and each key has a count of exactly `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1`. The `result` array is a list of length `n` where each index contains one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and every nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1` times in `result`. If `result[i]` is not '?', the postcondition remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The loop terminates when the count of all nucleotides in `counts` reaches their target count (`n // 4 + 1`), ensuring that each nucleotide type appears the required number of times in `result`.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit input parameters, reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, and either does not return any value or returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: None, the program does not return any value

Case_4: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
