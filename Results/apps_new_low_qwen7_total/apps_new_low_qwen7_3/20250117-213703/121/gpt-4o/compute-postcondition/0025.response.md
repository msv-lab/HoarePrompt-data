Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `counts[char]` is still less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, `counts[char]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `counts[char]` remains unchanged.***
