Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`. If `counts[char] < target_count`, then the dictionary is updated such that the count of `char` is incremented by 1, and the counts of `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'` are reset to `n//4`. Otherwise, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
