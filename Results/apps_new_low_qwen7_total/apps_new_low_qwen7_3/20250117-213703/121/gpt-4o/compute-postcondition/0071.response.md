Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and each key has a count of either `n // 4` or `n // 4 + 1`. The `result` array is a list of length `n` where each index contains one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and every nucleotide type appears at least once in `result`. If `result[i]` is not '?', the postcondition remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The loop terminates when the count of all nucleotides in `counts` reaches their target count (`n // 4 + 1`), ensuring that each nucleotide type appears the required number of times in `result`.**
