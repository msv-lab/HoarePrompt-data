The function `func_1` accepts no explicit input parameters. However, it reads input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. Based on the provided cases:

- Case_1: The program does not return any value
- Case_2: The program returns `None`
- Case_3: None, the program does not return any value (this is redundant with Case_1)
- Case_4: The program returns `None`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read input from standard input, where the input consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`, and either does not return any value or returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit input parameters, reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, and either does not return any value or returns `None`.**
