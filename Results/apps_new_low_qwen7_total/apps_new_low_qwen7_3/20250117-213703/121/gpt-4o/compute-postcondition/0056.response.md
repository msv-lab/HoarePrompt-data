Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having a count of either 1 or 2. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts['C']` is incremented to 2, and the result contains at least one 'C'. Otherwise, the counts remain unchanged and the result contains at least one 'C'.***
