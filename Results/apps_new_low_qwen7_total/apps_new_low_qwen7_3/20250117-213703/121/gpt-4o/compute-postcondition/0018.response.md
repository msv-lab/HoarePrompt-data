Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`. The current count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`***
