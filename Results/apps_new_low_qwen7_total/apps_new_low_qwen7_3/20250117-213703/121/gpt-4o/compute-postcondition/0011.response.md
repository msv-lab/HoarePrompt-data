The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `counts`. Since `char` is a key in the dictionary, its count will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255.
- `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least one character.
- `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, where the count of the character `char` is incremented by 1.
- `target_count` is `n // 4`.

After executing the code `counts[char] += 1`, the count of `char` in the dictionary `counts` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least one character, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, where the count of the character `char` is incremented by 1, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.**
