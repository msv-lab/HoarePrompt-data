To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
- `counts` is a dictionary initialized as `{'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}`.
- `target_count` is `n // 4`.

### Loop Header:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `char`:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must have at least one character.
   - Therefore, the length of `s` (which is `n`) must be greater than 0.

2. **Other Variables (`n`, `s`, `counts`, `target_count`):**
   - These variables do not directly control whether the loop will execute.
   - The loop will always execute as long as there is at least one character in `s`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the loop starts with a valid state, which means `s` should have at least one character.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the string `s` must have at least one character.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least one character, `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, `target_count` is `n // 4`**
