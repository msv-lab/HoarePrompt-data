Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) from standard input, where \( n \) represents the length of the genome and \( s \) consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4, and if not, it prints '===' and exits. If \( n \) is divisible by 4, it calculates the target count of each nucleotide as \( n // 4 \). It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in \( s \). If any nucleotide's count exceeds the target count, it prints '===' and exits. If not, it replaces all '?' characters in \( s \) with the nucleotides in lexicographical order ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that each nucleotide appears exactly the target count or \( n // 4 + 1 \) times. Finally, it prints the modified string. The function does not return any value.**
