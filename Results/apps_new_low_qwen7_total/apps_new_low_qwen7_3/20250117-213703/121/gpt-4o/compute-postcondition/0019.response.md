The code `print('===')` does not change any variables but simply prints the string '===' to the console. The output of the print statement is not stored in any variable, so the values of the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` that contains only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`. The current count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`; the console displays '==='**
