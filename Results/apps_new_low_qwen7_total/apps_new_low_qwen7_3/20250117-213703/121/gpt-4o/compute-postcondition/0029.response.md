Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and possibly '?', `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and `char` is set to the next key in the dictionary in lexicographical order. If `counts[char] > target_count`, the function returns None. Otherwise, `char` remains the same as the current key in the dictionary.***
