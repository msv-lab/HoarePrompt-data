Postcondition: ***`counts` contains the keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, and at least one of the counts must be less than `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result` is `['A']` and `counts` is updated to be `{'A': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}`. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then no change occurs to `result` and `counts`.***
