Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 255, s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', counts is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, target_count is n // 4**

Explanation:
- The variable `target_count` is calculated as `n // 4`, which means it is the integer division of `n` by 4.
- The dictionary `counts` is initialized with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having a value of 0.
- The string `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code block. It still consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and has a length of `n`.
- The precondition that `n % 4 == 0` ensures that `target_count` will be an integer, and the dictionary `counts` is ready to be populated with the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s` if needed in further code.
