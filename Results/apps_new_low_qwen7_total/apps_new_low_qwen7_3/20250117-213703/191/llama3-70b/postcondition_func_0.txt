The function processes a star map represented as a 2D list where each element is either '.' or '*', indicating empty space or a star respectively. It reads the dimensions of the star map from user input, constructs a list of coordinates for all stars found in the map, and then calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the stars. If no stars are found, the function returns a side length of 1. The function does not modify the original input but rather uses the input to derive the required output.
