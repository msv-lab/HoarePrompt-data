The given code block starts by taking two integers `n` and `m` as input and splitting them using `map(int, input().split())`. It then initializes an empty list `stars` to store the 2D list representing the star map. However, the code snippet does not complete the initialization of the `stars` list with the actual star map data. Therefore, we can only conclude that `n` and `m` are set to the dimensions of the star map, and `stars` is an empty list. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state where `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and `stars` is an empty list, the final output state will be:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, stars is an empty list**
