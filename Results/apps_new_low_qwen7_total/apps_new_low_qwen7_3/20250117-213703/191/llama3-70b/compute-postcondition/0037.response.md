The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a new tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Given that `j` is initially 2, and `_` is typically used as a placeholder for the current element in a loop, but here it's not explicitly defined within the context of a loop, it would be interpreted as `row[0]` since `row` is a non-empty string and `row[0]` refers to the first character of the string.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `row` is a non-empty string
- `j` is 2
- `stars` is a list containing the tuple `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2])]`

After executing the code, the list `stars` will have an additional tuple appended to it. The new tuple will be `(2, row[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and `stars` is a list containing the tuples `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2]), (2, row[0])]`**
