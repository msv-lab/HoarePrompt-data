The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Here, `_` is a placeholder typically used in contexts where a name is not required, such as in some linters or when using auto-completion features in certain IDEs. However, since the value of `_` is not specified, it remains as `_`.

Given that the initial state does not provide specific values for `j` and `_`, the only change is that the tuple `(j, _)` is added to the list `stars`. Therefore, the output state is that the list `stars` now contains this new tuple.

Output State: **`stars` is a list containing an additional element `(j, _)`, `j` is unchanged, and `_` is unchanged**
