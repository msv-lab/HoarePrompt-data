The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple containing the value of `j` and an underscore (`_`) to the list `stars`. Since `_` is not defined in the provided context, it is likely that `_` refers to the last retrieved item from `row` or is intended to represent the current character being processed, which is `c` (the first character of `row` and currently '*'). Given the initial state, `j` is 0, and `c` is '*', so `_` is '*'.

After the code runs, the list `stars` will have one additional tuple `(0, '*')`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, `c` is '*', `stars` is `[ (0, '*') ]`**
