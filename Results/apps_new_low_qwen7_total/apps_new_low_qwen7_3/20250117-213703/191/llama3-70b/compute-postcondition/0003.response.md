To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is a positive integer
- `stars` is an empty list
- `row` is an input string

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (j, c) in enumerate(row):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop uses the `enumerate` function on `row`, which means the loop will use two variables: `j` and `c`.
     - `j`: This is the index of the current character in the string `row`.
     - `c`: This is the character at the current index `j` in the string `row`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate as long as there are characters left in the string `row`.
   - The loop will stop when `row` is completely exhausted.

3. **Initial State Before the First Iteration**:
   - Since we are starting the loop, `j` should be 0 (the first index of the string).
   - `c` should be the character at index 0 of `row`.

4. **Verification**:
   - We need to ensure that the string `row` is not empty for the loop to execute. If `row` is empty, `enumerate(row)` would return an empty iterator, and the loop would not execute.
   - However, the problem states that `row` is an input string, which implies it is non-empty (otherwise, it wouldn't be called a string).

5. **Summary**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be 0, and `c` must be the character at index 0 of `row`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, `c` is the first character of `row`**
