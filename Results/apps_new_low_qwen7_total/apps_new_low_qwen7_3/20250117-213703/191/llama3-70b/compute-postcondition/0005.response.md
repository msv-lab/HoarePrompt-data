`stars` is appended with the tuple `(j, _)`. Since `j` is 0 and `_` is the value of `c` (which is '*'), the tuple added to `stars` is `(0, '*')`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new entry in the `stars` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is ['(0, \'*\')'], `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, `c` is the first character of `row`.**
