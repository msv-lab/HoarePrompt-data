The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple containing the current values of `j` and `_` to the list `stars`. Since `_` is not defined in the provided context, it should be assumed that `_` refers to the current character `c` from the string `row`. Given the previous state:

- `j` is 1 (as it was incremented from 0 in the previous iteration).
- `c` is the second character in `row`.
- `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')']` if the first character was '*', or an empty list if the first character was not '*'.

Let's assume `c` is the second character of `row` and it is '*'. Therefore, the tuple `(j, _)` will be `(1, '*')` and appended to `stars`. If `c` is not '*', then `stars` remains unchanged.

### Case 1: `c` is '*'
- `stars` becomes `['(0, \'*\')', (1, '*')]`.

### Case 2: `c` is not '*'
- `stars` remains `['(0, \'*\')']` if the first character was '*', or remains an empty list if the first character was not '*'.

Given that `_` is the second character `c`, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')', (1, '*')]` if the second character is '*', or `['(0, \'*\')']` if the second character is not '*', `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character of `row`.**
