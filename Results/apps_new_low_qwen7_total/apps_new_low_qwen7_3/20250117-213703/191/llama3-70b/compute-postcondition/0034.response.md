The code `stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. However, the variable `_` is not defined in the given context, which suggests there might be a placeholder or an issue with the code snippet. Assuming `_` is intended to be `row[j-1]` (since `j` starts from 1 and `row` is a string), the updated state would be:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `row` is a non-empty string
- `j` is 1
- `stars` now contains a tuple `(1, row[0])`

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `stars` is `[('1', row[0])]`**
