`row` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a line of text from the standard input. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the input is read into a new variable `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `row` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `row` is a string input from the user**
