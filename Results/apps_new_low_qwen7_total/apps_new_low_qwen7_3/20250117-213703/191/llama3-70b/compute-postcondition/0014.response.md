The only objects in the loop head are variables `n` and `_`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Since the variable `_` is an internal iterator and does not affect the loop condition, it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0**
