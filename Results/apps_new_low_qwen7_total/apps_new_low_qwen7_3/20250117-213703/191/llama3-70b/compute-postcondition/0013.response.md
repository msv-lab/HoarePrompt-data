Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list containing tuples `(j, '*')` where `j` is the index of each '*' character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is the index of the last '*' character found in `row`, `c` is the last character of `row` that was checked.**

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `row` using `enumerate` to get both the index `j` and the character `c`. If the character `c` is '*', it appends a tuple `(j, '*')` to the list `stars`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariants**: 
     - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not used in the loop.
     - `row` remains the same string, but `j` and `c` change with each iteration.
   - **Variables that Change**:
     - `stars`: Appended with tuples `(j, '*')` whenever `c` is '*'.
     - `j`: Incremented by 1 with each iteration.
     - `c`: Takes the value of the current character being processed in each iteration.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop continues to iterate until every character in `row` has been checked. After all iterations, `stars` will contain a tuple for every '*' character found in `row`, where each tuple consists of the index `j` and the character '*'. The variable `j` will hold the index of the last character checked, and `c` will be the last character of `row` that was checked.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. The loop ensures that every '*' in `row` is recorded in `stars`, and `j` and `c` reflect the last position and character processed.
