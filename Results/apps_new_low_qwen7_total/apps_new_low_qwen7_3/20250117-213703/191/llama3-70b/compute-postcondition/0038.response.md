Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and `stars` is a list containing the tuples `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2])]`. If `c` equals '*', then `stars` is updated to `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2]), (2, row[0])]`. Otherwise, the state remains as `stars` being `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2])]`.***
