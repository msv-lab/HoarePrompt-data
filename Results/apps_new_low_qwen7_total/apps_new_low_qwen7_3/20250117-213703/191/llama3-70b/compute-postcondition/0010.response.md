Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for (j, c) in enumerate(row):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `j` and `c`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')', (1, '*')]` if the second character of `row` is '*', or `['(0, \'*\')']` if the second character is not '*'.
   - `row` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `c` is the second character of `row`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `row`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, meaning `c` is the second character of `row`.

4. **Determine the state needed for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should be 2.
   - `c` should be the third character of `row`.

5. **Construct the new state:**
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `m` remains a positive integer.
   - `stars` remains either `['(0, \'*\')', (1, '*')]` if the second character of `row` is '*', or `['(0, \'*\')']` if the second character is not '*'.
   - `row` remains a non-empty string.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `c` is now the third character of `row`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')', (1, '*')]` if the second character of `row` is '*', or `['(0, \'*\')']` if the second character is not '*', `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, `c` is the third character of `row`.**
