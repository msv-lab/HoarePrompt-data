The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `c`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value it represents in the string `row`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is greater than 1,
- `row` is a non-empty string,
- `j` is 1,
- `stars` is a list containing the tuple `[('1', row[0])]`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than the length of `row`, and `c` must be the character at position `j` in `row`.

Since `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` would be 2 if `row` has at least 3 characters. Therefore, `c` would be `row[2]`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2, and `c` must be `row[2]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and `stars` is a list containing the tuple `[('1', row[0]), ('2', row[2])]**.
