The code `stars.append((j, _))` attempts to append a tuple to the `stars` list. However, in the initial state, `stars` is mentioned as "no longer valid," which implies that `stars` is not defined or is invalid. Since `stars` is not a valid list, appending to it would raise an error. Given this context, we cannot proceed with the code execution as specified.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, `stars` is no longer valid, the current value of `c` is '*'**
