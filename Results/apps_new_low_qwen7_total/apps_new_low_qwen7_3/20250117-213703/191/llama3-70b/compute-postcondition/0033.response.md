Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `c`.
   - `j` is the index of the character in the string `row`.
   - `c` is the character at the current index `j` in the string `row`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `row` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `stars` is no longer valid.
   - If `c` equals '*', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will increment `j` by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.
   - The character `c` will be the second character in the string `row`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `j` is updated to 1.
   - `c` becomes the character at index 1 in `row`.

5. **Verify the Conditions**:
   - `n` is still greater than 1.
   - `row` remains a non-empty string.
   - `stars` is no longer valid.
   - The condition `if c == '*'` will depend on the character at index 1 in `row`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `stars` is no longer valid, and if `c` equals '*', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**

Since `c` is not explicitly defined in the updated state, it will remain as a placeholder for the character at index 1 in `row`:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `stars` is no longer valid, and if `c` equals '*', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
