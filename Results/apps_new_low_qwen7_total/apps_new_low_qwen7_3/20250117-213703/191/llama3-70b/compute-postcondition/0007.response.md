Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined by the tuple `(j, c)` where `j` is the index and `c` is the character from the string `row`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')']` or an empty list.
   - `row` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `c` is the first character of `row`.
   - If `c` equals '*', then `stars` becomes `['(0, \'*\')']`. Otherwise, `stars` remains unchanged.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `row` to process. This means `j < len(row)`.

4. **Update the states at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `c` will be the next character in `row`.

5. **Consider the possible changes in `stars`**:
   - If `c` is '*', then `stars` becomes `['(0, \'*\')']`.
   - If `c` is not '*', `stars` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains a positive integer.
- `stars` will either remain `['(0, \'*\')']` if the first character was '*', or remain unchanged if the first character was not '*'.
- `row` remains the same non-empty string.
- `j` will be 1 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1).
- `c` will be the second character in `row`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is either `['(0, \'*\')']` or an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character of `row`.**
