Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head in the given code is `for (j, c) in enumerate(row):`. This means the loop variables are `j` and `c`.

2. **Determine Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `row` is a non-empty string
   - `j` is 0
   - `c` is '*'
   - The list `stars` contains the tuple `(0, '*')`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `row` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0, it will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `c` will be the next character in the string `row`.
   - For the loop to continue, `row` must have at least one character left to process.

Given that `row` is a non-empty string and `j` is 0 initially, the loop will execute for the first time. After the first iteration, `j` will become 1, and `c` will be the second character in the string `row`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `n` remains unchanged because it was not used in the loop.
   - `row` should now have at least one character less than before, but it must still be a non-empty string.
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `c` will be the second character in the string `row`.
   - The list `stars` remains unchanged because the condition for adding a new tuple was not met (`c` is '*').

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in the string `row`, and the list `stars` contains the tuple `(0, '*')`**
