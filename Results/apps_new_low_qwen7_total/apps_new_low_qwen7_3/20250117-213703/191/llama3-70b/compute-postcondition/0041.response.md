Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the code step-by-step to determine the final output state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index and the asterisk character from each row where an asterisk was found. Each tuple in `stars` has the form `(j, '*')` where `j` is the index of the asterisk in its respective row, and the rows are processed up to `n` times.
- `row` is the last non-empty string read during the loop
- `j` is the index of the last asterisk character found in `row`

### Code Snippet:
```python
min_x = min(x for x, y in stars)
max_x = max(x for x, y in stars)
min_y = min(y for x, y in stars)
max_y = max(y for x, y in stars)
side = max(max_x - min_x + 1, max_y - min_y + 1)
print(side)
```

### Analysis:
1. **min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y**: These variables are computed based on the values in the `stars` list. `min_x` and `max_x` find the minimum and maximum x-values (indices), respectively, while `min_y` and `max_y` find the minimum and maximum y-values (asterisk characters) in the `stars` list.
2. **side**: This variable is calculated as the maximum difference between `max_x - min_x + 1` and `max_y - min_y + 1`.
3. **print(side)**: This line prints the value of `side`.

Since the `stars` list is not provided, we can't compute exact numerical values for `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`. However, we can express them in terms of the elements in `stars`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `m` remains a positive integer
- `stars` remains a list of tuples as described initially
- `row` remains the last non-empty string read during the loop
- `j` remains the index of the last asterisk character found in `row`
- `side` is the computed value based on the elements in `stars`

Since we don't have the actual `stars` list, we cannot provide a numerical value for `side`. However, we know that `side` is derived from the `stars` list.

### Output State:
**Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, stars is a list of tuples as described initially, row is the last non-empty string read during the loop, j is the index of the last asterisk character found in row, side is the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x-values plus one and the maximum and minimum y-values plus one, calculated from the elements in stars**
