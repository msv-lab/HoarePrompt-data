Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and the list `stars` contains the tuples `(0, '*')` and `(1, c)`. If the character at index 2 in `row` is '*', the list `stars` is updated to contain an additional tuple `(2, _)` where `_` is the last character in `row`. Otherwise, the list `stars` remains unchanged.***
