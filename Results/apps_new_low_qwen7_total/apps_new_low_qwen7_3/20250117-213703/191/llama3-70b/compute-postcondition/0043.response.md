Functionality: **The function processes a star map represented as a 2D list where each element is either '.' or '*', indicating empty space or a star respectively. It reads the dimensions of the star map from user input, constructs a list of coordinates for all stars found in the map, and then calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the stars. If no stars are found, the function returns a side length of 1. The function does not modify the original input but rather uses the input to derive the required output.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If no stars are present in the star map, the function correctly returns a side length of 1.
- If the star map is empty (i.e., `n` or `m` is 0), the function should not proceed with the calculations, as indicated by the initial check on `n` and `m`. However, the current code does not handle this case explicitly. To address this, the function should ensure that `n` and `m` are both greater than 0 before proceeding with the calculations.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input dimensions `n` or `m` are less than or equal to 0, although the code checks this condition initially. To fully handle edge cases, the function should raise an error or return an appropriate value when `n` or `m` are invalid.
