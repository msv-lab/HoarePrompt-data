Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for (j, c) in enumerate(row):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `c`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `row` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The list `stars` contains the tuples `(0, '*')` and `(1, c)`.

4. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` must be less than the length of `row`.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` would be 2.
   - Therefore, `c` should be the character at index 2 in the string `row`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `row` remains a non-empty string.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `c` is the character at index 2 in `row`.
   - The list `stars` will now contain the tuples `(0, '*')`, `(1, c)`, and `(2, some_value)`, where `some_value` is the character at index 2 in `row`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and the list `stars` contains the tuples `(0, '*')` and `(1, c)` where `c` is the character at index 2 in `row`**.
