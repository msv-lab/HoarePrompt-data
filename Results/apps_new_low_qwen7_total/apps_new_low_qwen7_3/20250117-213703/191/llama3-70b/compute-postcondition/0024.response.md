`stars.append((j, _))` appends a tuple to the list `stars`. Here, `j` is 2, so the tuple `(2, _)` is appended to the list `stars`. The value of `_` (which represents the last character in the string `row`) is added as the second element of the tuple.

The initial state of `stars` is `[(0, '*'), (1, c)]`, where `c` is the character at index 2 in `row`. After appending `(2, _)` to `stars`, the new state of `stars` will be `[(0, '*'), (1, c), (2, _)]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, and the list `stars` contains the tuples `(0, '*')`, `(1, c)`, and `(2, _)` where `c` is the character at index 2 in `row` and `_` is the last character in `row`.**
