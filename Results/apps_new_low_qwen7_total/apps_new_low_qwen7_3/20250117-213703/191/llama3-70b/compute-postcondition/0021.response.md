The code appends a tuple `(j, _)` to the list `stars`. Here, `_` is a placeholder that typically refers to the last value of the expression before the comma in the tuple, which in this case is `c` (the second character in the string `row`). Since `j` is 1, the appended tuple is `(1, c)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `row` is a non-empty string
- `j` is 1
- `c` is the second character in the string `row`
- the list `stars` contains the tuple `(0, '*')`

After executing `stars.append((j, _))`, the list `stars` will contain both `(0, '*')` and `(1, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `c` is the second character in the string `row`, and the list `stars` contains the tuples `(0, '*')` and `(1, c)`**
