Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is equal to the length of `row`, and the list `stars` contains all pairs `(j, c)` where `c` is a '*' in `row`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `row` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `j` and the character `c`.
   - If `c` is '*', the tuple `(j, c)` is appended to the list `stars`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: 
     - `n`: Remains constant as it is not modified within the loop.
     - `row`: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - **Variables Changed**:
     - `j`: Incremented by 1 with each iteration.
     - `c`: The current character in `row` for each iteration.
     - `stars`: Updated with tuples `(j, c)` only when `c` is '*'.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues until all characters in `row` have been processed, meaning `j` will be equal to the length of `row` after the loop completes.
   - The list `stars` will contain all pairs `(j, c)` for each character `c` in `row` that is '*', regardless of the order of characters.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop iterates through each character in `row`, checking if it is '*', and appending the corresponding tuple to `stars`.
   - After the loop, `j` will be equal to the length of `row` because it increments by 1 for each character in `row`.
   - The final state of `stars` will include all positions and characters from `row` where the character was '*', ensuring no extraneous or missing entries.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed is as described above.
