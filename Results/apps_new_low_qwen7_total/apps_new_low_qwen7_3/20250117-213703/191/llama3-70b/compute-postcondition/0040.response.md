Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `stars` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index and the asterisk character from each row where an asterisk was found. Each tuple in `stars` has the form `(j, '*')` where `j` is the index of the asterisk in its respective row, and the rows are processed up to `n` times. The variable `row` is the last non-empty string read during the loop, and `j` is the index of the last asterisk character found in `row`. If no asterisks are found in any row, `stars` will be an empty list. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
