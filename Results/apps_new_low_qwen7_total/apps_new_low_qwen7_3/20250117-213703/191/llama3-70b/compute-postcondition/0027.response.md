Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `n` is greater than 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is equal to the length of `row`, and the list `stars` contains all pairs `(j, c)` where `c` is a '*' in `row`.

Since the loop condition depends only on `n`, and `n` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`row`, `j`, and `stars`) do not change within the loop head, so they remain the same.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `j` is equal to the length of `row`, and the list `stars` contains all pairs `(j, c)` where `c` is a '*' in `row`**
