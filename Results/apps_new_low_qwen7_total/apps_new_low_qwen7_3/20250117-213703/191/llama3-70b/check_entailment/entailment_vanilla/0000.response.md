Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to find the minimum square that can cover all the stars ('*') on the given rectangular grid. The program correctly follows these steps:

1. It reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m).
2. It iterates over each row and column to identify the positions of all stars ('*') and stores their coordinates in a list called `stars`.
3. It calculates the minimum and maximum x-coordinates (`min_x`, `max_x`) and y-coordinates (`min_y`, `max_y`) of the stars.
4. It determines the width and height of the smallest rectangle that contains all the stars.
5. Finally, it prints the side length of the smallest square that can cover all the stars.

The logic used in the program is sound and matches the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work correctly under the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
