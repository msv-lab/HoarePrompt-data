Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the minimum side length of a square that can cover all the stars in the given star map. It iterates through each row to find the positions of all stars, then calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of these stars. Finally, it determines the side length of the smallest square that can cover all the stars by taking the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum coordinates plus one. This approach ensures that the program works for all potential cases where stars are distributed across the rectangular map. Since the program correctly handles all given examples and the nature of the problem, it is correct.
