### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `t` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `t` as input.
   - It iterates through possible lengths of prefixes (`i`) from 1 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`).
   - For each prefix length `i`, it checks if the prefix matches the suffix of the same length.
   - If such a match is found, it constructs the potential original message `s` by removing the matching suffix from `t`.
   - It then checks if appending this suffix back to `s` results in the original string `t`. If this condition is met, it returns "YES" followed by `s`.
   - If no such match is found after the loop, it returns "NO".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the entire string could be considered a valid transmission without any errors (like "abcabc").
   - It also correctly identifies when the string is fully composed of repeating segments (like "abababab").

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For "abrakadabrabrakadabra", the program correctly identifies that "abrakadabra" is a valid original message.
   - For "acacacaca", the program correctly identifies that "acaca" is a valid original message.
   - For "abcabc", the program correctly identifies that there is no error and returns "NO".
   - For "abababab", the program correctly identifies that "ababab" is a valid original message.
   - For "tatbt", the program correctly identifies that there is no error and returns "NO".

Given the analysis, the program logic seems to accurately implement the required functionality and correctly handles all provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: True**
