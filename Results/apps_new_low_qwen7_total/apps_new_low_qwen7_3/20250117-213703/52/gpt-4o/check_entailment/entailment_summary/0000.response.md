Reasoning:
1. The provided code defines a function `func_1` which takes a string `t` as input.
2. The function iterates through possible lengths of prefixes and suffixes of `t` and checks if they are equal.
3. If such a pair of prefix and suffix is found, it constructs the potential original message `s` by removing the suffix from `t` and returns 'YES' followed by this string `s`.
4. If no such pair is found, it returns 'NO'.
5. This logic correctly identifies if the input string `t` could be the result of the described error and provides a possible original message `s`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. The function only checks if any prefix of `t` is equal to any suffix of `t`, but it does not ensure that the length of the overlapping part is positive. Additionally, the function does not consider all possible overlapping cases where the overlap is shorter than the entire prefix or suffix.

To fix this, we need to check all possible overlaps where the length of the overlap is positive and less than the length of the substring. Here's how we can correct the function:

```python
def func_1(t):
    n = len(t)
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):  # Check all possible lengths for overlap
        if t.startswith(t[-i:]) and t.endswith(t[:i]):
            s = t[:-i]
            if s + t[-i:] == t:
                return 'YES\n' + s
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected function will properly identify if the input string `t` could be the result of the described error and provide a possible original message `s`.

Correctness: **False**

Given the provided execution summary, the original function does not fully capture the requirements of the problem, hence the correctness is False.
