Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given string \( t \) can be the result of a transmission error where two messages are incorrectly combined due to overlapping. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single non-empty string \( t \) which consists only of lowercase Latin letters and ensures its length is within the specified limit (up to 100 characters). This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(t)` iterates over possible lengths \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) (where \( n \) is the length of \( t \)). For each \( i \), it checks if the prefix \( t[:i] \) is equal to the suffix \( t[-i:] \).
   - If such an \( i \) is found, it means that the message could have been split into two parts that were transmitted separately but then erroneously combined. In this case, the function returns 'YES' followed by the string \( t \) with the last \( i \) characters removed (`s = t[:-i]`), which is one of the possible original messages before the error occurred.
   - If no such \( i \) is found, the function correctly returns 'NO', indicating that the string \( t \) cannot be the result of such a transmission error.

3. **Output Handling**: The program calls `func_1(t)` and prints its result, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the examples provided, the function behaves as expected:
- For "abrakadabrabrakadabra", it finds that "abrakadabra" was the original message before the error, so it returns "YES" followed by "abrakadabra".
- For "acacacaca", it finds that "acaca" was the original message, so it returns "YES" followed by "acaca".
- For "abcabc", it correctly identifies that no error occurred, so it returns "NO".
- For "abababab", it finds that "ababab" was the original message, so it returns "YES" followed by "ababab".

Since the program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected results based on the problem statement, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
