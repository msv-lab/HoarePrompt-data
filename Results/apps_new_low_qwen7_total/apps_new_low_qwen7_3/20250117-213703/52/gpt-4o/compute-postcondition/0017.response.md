Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `t[:-3]`. If the substring of `t` from the start to index 3 is equal to the substring of `t` from the end to the start minus 3 (i.e., `t[:3] == t[-3:]`), then the output is `YES\n` followed by the string `t` without its last three characters. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.***
