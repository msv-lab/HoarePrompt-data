Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the substring of `t` from index 0 to 0 (i.e., `t[:1]`) is equal to the substring of `t` from the last index to the last index (i.e., `t[-1:]`).***
