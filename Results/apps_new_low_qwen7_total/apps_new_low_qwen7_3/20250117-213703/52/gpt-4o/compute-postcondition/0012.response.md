Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `t[:-2]`. If `t[:i] == t[-i:]`, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` with the last two characters removed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
