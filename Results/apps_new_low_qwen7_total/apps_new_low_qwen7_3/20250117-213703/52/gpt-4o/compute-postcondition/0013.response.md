Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is `t[:-2]`.
   - If `t[:i] == t[-i:]`, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` with the last two characters removed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is running from `1` to `n-1`, the value of `i` will increment by 1 each time the loop iterates.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged because the condition to return 'YES\n' was not met in the previous iteration (since `i` was 2).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `t[:-2]`.**
