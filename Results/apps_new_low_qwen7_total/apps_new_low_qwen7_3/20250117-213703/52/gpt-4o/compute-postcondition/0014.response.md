The code updates the value of `s` to be `t[:-i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `s` is reassigned to `t[:-3]`. The length of `t` remains `n`, and `i` remains 3. The initial value of `s` was `t[:-2]`, but now it is updated to `t[:-3]`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `t[:-3]`.**
