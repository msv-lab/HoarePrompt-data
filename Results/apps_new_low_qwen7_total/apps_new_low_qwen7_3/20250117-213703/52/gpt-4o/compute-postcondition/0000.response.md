The code calculates the length of the string `t` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of `t` is stored in `n`, and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters; `n` is equal to the length of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters; `n` is equal to the length of `t`.**
