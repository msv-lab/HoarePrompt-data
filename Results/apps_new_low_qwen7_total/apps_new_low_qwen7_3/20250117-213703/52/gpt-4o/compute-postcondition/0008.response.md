Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition `t[:1] == t[-1:]` determines whether the loop continues.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be set to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `n` does not change within the loop and remains the same.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `t` is still a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `n` is still the length of `t` and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
