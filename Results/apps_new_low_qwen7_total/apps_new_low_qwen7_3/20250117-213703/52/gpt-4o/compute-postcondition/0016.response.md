Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `t[:-3]`. If `s + t[-i:] == t`, then the output is `YES\n` followed by the string `t` without its last three characters. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.***
