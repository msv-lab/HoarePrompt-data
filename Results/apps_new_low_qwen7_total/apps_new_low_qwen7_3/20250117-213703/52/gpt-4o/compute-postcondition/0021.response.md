Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `t` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that the prefix `t[:i]` is equal to the suffix `t[-i:]`. If such an `i` is found, the function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` with the suffix `t[-i:]` removed. If no such `i` exists, the function returns 'NO'.**

**Specifically, the function will perform the following actions:**
- Calculate the length of the input string `t`.
- Iterate through possible values of `i` from 1 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `t`).
- For each `i`, check if `t[:i]` is equal to `t[-i:]`.
- If a match is found, construct the string `s` as `t[:-i]` and return 'YES\n' followed by `s`.
- If no match is found after the loop, return 'NO'.

**Edge cases and potential missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where no matching prefix-suffix pair is found, returning 'NO'.
- The function correctly handles the case where a matching prefix-suffix pair is found and returns 'YES\n' followed by the appropriate substring.
- However, the provided annotations and return postconditions do not cover all possible cases explicitly. For instance, the annotations suggest three specific cases (with modifications like removing the last character, last two characters, or last three characters), but the actual code logic does not necessarily align with these specific cases. The function simply removes the longest matching prefix-suffix pair and returns 'YES\n' with the modified string. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes will be either 'YES\n' followed by the modified string or 'NO' depending on whether such a prefix-suffix pair exists.
