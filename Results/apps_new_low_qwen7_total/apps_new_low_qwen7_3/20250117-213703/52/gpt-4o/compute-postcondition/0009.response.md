The code `s = t[:-i]` slices the string `t` from the beginning to the character before the last two characters (since `i` is 2). This means `s` will contain all characters of `t` except the last two characters. 

Given that `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` is the length of `t` (so `n > 1`), the value of `i` is 2. Therefore, `s` will be `t` excluding the last two characters.

Output State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `t[:-2]`**
