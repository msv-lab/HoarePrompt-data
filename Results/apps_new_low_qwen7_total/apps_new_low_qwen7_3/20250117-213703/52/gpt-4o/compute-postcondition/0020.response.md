The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters. The function returns one of the following cases based on the length and content of `t`:

- Case_1: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `s` which is equal to `t[:-1]`.
- Case_2: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` with the last two characters removed.
- Case_3: The function returns 'YES\n' followed by the string `t` without its last three characters.
- Case_4: The function returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `t` and return 'YES\n' followed by a modified version of `t` based on specific conditions, or return 'NO' if none of the conditions are met.
