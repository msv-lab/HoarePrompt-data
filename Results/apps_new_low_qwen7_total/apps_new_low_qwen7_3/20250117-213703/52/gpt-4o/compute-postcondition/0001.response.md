Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`, so the relevant variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the First Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - From the given state, `n` is equal to the length of the string `t`.
   - Since `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and its length does not exceed 100 characters, `n` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

4. **Ensure `i` is 1:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1.
   - If `i` is 1, then the condition `1 <= i < n` is satisfied as long as `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the state of the program before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `t` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**.
