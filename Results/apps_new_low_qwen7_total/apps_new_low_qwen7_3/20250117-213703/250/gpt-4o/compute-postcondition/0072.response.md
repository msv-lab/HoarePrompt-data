Postcondition: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` remains `False`, `new_marks` is not empty, and its value is determined as follows: if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y`. The if condition evaluates to `True` because `new_marks` is not empty.**
