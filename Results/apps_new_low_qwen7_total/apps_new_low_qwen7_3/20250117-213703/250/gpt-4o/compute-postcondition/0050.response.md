The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mark` and `x`. Since `x_found` and `y_found` are both `False`, it implies that `x` has not been found yet. The value of `mark` is not specified, but we know it must be an element in `marks`.

Given this, the only affected variable is `new_marks`, which now contains the value `mark + x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark + x`**
