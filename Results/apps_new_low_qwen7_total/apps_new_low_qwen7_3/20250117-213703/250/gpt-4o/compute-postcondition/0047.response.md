Postcondition: ***`marks` must be defined and contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`. `new_marks` is updated based on the following conditions: if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is found in `marks_set` after the if condition, `new_marks` becomes either `{mark + x, mark + y}` or `{mark - x, mark + y}`. Otherwise, `new_marks` becomes `{mark + x}` or `{mark - x}` plus `{mark - y}`, and the condition `mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set` is satisfied. The variable `y_found` remains `False`.***
