Postcondition: ***`marks` must be defined and contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, and `new_marks` is either `{mark + x}` or `{mark - x}`. Additionally, either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`. The variable `y_found` remains `False`, and `(mark + y + x not in marks_set and mark + y - x not in marks_set and mark - y + x not in marks_set)` holds true. The condition `mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set` is now satisfied.***
