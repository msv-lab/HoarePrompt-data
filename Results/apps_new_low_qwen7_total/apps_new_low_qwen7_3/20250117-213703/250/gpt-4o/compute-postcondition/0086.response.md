Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence `marks` (a list of integers) representing distances from marks to the origin, along with integers `x` and `y` satisfying the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\). The function checks if both `x` and `y` can be found within the `marks` list using the existing marks, considering both forward and backward distances. If both `x` and `y` are found, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it constructs a new set `new_marks` by checking if certain conditions involving `x` and `y` hold true for each mark in `marks`. If `new_marks` is non-empty, it prints `1` followed by the single element in `new_marks`. If neither `x` nor `y` is found in `new_marks`, it prints the length of the list `result`, which is either `[x]` or `[y]` based on the conditions.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. **Empty Input:** If `marks` is an empty list, the function should handle this case gracefully. However, the current implementation assumes `marks` contains at least one element.
2. **Invalid `x` and `y`:** If the values of `x` and `y` do not exist in `marks` under any transformation, the function will still proceed to check other combinations, which might lead to unnecessary computations.
3. **Duplicate Marks:** The function does not account for duplicate marks in the `marks` list, which might affect the results of the transformations.
4. **Missing Conditions:** There are conditions like `mark + x + y in marks_set` or `mark - y + x in marks_set` that could potentially miss valid pairs if they do not strictly follow the order of the `marks` list.

**Final State of the Program:**
- The function will output either `0`, `1` followed by a single element from `new_marks`, or the length of `result` which is either `[x]` or `[y]` depending on the conditions evaluated.
- The final state of the program will have `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks_set` undefined, and `x_found` and `y_found` will be `False` unless both are found within the transformations. The `new_marks` will either be empty or contain one specific element based on the conditions, and `result` will be either `[x]` or `[y]` or empty.
