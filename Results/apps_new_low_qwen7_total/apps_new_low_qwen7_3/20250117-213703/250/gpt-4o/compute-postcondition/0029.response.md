The code initializes an empty set named `new_marks`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is undefined, `l` is undefined, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `marks_set` is a subset of the original `marks_set`, `x_found` is boolean, `y_found` is boolean, where `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False; `new_marks` is an empty set**
