Postcondition: ***`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` remains `False`. `new_marks` will either be an empty set or will contain one of the following elements based on the conditions checked within the loop: if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark + y`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark - y`. If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark + x`. If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y`. Additionally, `result` will remain an empty list since there is no else part that assigns any value to it.***
