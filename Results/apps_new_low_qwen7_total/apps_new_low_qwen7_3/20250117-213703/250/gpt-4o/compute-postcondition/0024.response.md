Postcondition: ***`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` excluding the current `mark` plus one, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark` and the new `mark`, `y_found` remains unchanged, and `x_found` remains unchanged. If the condition `x_found and y_found` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
