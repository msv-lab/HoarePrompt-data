The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are inside. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set`; `x` is an integer; `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`; `y_found` remains unchanged; `x_found` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set`; `x` is an integer; `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`; `y_found` remains unchanged; `x_found` remains unchanged.**
