The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it works with a sequence `a` which is a list of integers such that 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l, where n and l are defined within the function's scope, and each a_i is an integer representing the distance from the i-th mark to the origin. The function also has the constraints that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, where x and y are integers within the range of the sequence `a`.

Given the lack of explicit return information in the problem statement, we can infer that the function might be expected to return a specific value or perform an operation based on the sequence `a` and the constraints. However, since the exact output is not specified, we will focus on the input and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence `a` (a list of integers), where 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l, and n and l satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, with the additional constraint that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l for some integers x and y within the sequence `a`.**
