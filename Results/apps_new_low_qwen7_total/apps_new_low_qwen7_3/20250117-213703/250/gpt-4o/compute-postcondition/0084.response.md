Postcondition: ***`n` and `l` are undefined, `x` and `y` are integers, `marks_set` is a subset of the original `marks_set`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, then `marks` contains at least one element, `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False`. Otherwise, if `x_found` and `y_found` are `False`, `marks` may be an empty set or contain one of the specified elements based on the conditions checked within the loop, and `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False`. `new_marks` will either be an empty set or will contain one of the specified elements, and `result` remains an empty list.***
