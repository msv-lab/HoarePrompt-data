`x_found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `mark`, `x`, and `marks_set` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mark` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is a set of integers, `mark + x` is either in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `x_found` is `True`.

Output State: **`mark` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is a set of integers, `mark + x` is either in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `x_found` is `True`**
