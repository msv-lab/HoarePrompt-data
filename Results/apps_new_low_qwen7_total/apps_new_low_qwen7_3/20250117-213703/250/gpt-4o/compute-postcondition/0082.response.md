Output State: **marks must contain at least one element, x_found remains False, y_found remains False, new_marks will remain an empty list, result is now an empty list** 

Explanation:
- The first line `print(len(result))` prints the length of the `result` list, which is initially an empty list. Since `result` is empty, `len(result)` will print `0`.
- The second line `print(' '.join(map(str, result)))` prints the elements of `result` joined by spaces. Since `result` is empty, no elements are printed, and an empty string is printed.

No other variables are affected by the given code snippet.
