Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step to determine the final output state after all executions of the loop.

### Initial State
- `n`: An integer (not used in the loop)
- `l`: An integer (not used in the loop)
- `x`: An integer
- `y`: An integer
- `marks`: A list of integers
- `marks_set`: A set containing integers from the list `marks`
- `x_found`: Boolean, initially `False`
- `y_found`: Boolean, initially `False`

### Code of the Loop
```python
for mark in marks:
    if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
        x_found = True
    if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
        y_found = True
    if x_found and y_found:
        break
```

### Analysis and Tracking

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `mark` in `marks`.
   - For each `mark`, it checks if `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`.
   - If both conditions (`x_found` and `y_found`) are met for any `mark`, the loop breaks.

2. **Variables**:
   - `marks` and `marks_set` are modified only partially as the loop progresses (specifically, the current `mark` is removed from `marks_set`).
   - `x_found` and `y_found` can change to `True` if their respective conditions are met.
   - `x` and `y` remain constant throughout the loop.

3. **Final State Determination**:
   - The loop will terminate either when it finds a `mark` such that both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, or it will complete all iterations without finding such a `mark`.
   - If the loop breaks, `x_found` and `y_found` will be `True` for the `mark` that satisfied the condition.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `x_found` and `y_found` will still be `False`.

### Output State After All Executions

- **Final Values of Variables**:
  - `n` and `l` remain undefined as they are not used in the loop.
  - `x` and `y` remain the same.
  - `marks_set` will be a subset of the original `marks_set`, excluding all `marks` processed by the loop.
  - `x_found` and `y_found` will both be `True` if the loop breaks, otherwise, they will be `False`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`n` is undefined, `l` is undefined, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `marks_set` is a subset of the original `marks_set`, `x_found` is boolean, `y_found` is boolean, where `x_found` and `y_found` are both True if the loop breaks, otherwise both are False.**
