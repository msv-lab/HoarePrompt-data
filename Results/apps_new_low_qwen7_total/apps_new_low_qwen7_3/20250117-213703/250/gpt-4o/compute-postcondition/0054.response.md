Postcondition: ***`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`. `new_marks` contains either `mark + x` if `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` is found in `marks_set`, or `mark - x` if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`, otherwise `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
