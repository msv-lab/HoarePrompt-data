The only objects in the loop head are `mark`, `marks_set`, and no other variables are mentioned in the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, `mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set`, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`, and `y_found` and `x_found` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `mark` variable needs to take the next value from the `marks_set`. Since `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`, the next `mark` will be the next integer in the set.

Let's assume the current `mark` is `m`. The next `mark` will be `m + 1` (or another consecutive integer depending on the order in the set).

Given that `marks_set` is a set of integers excluding the current `mark`, and assuming the order is sequential:

- `marks_set` will now exclude the new `mark`.
- `x` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `y_found` and `x_found` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` excluding the current `mark` plus one, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark` and the new `mark`, `y_found` remains unchanged, `x_found` remains unchanged.**
