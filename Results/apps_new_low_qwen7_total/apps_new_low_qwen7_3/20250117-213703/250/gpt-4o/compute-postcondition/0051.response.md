`new_marks` is updated by adding `mark - x` to it. The values of `marks`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.**
