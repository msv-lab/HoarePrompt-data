Postcondition: ***`marks` must be defined and contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `new_marks` is either `{mark + x}` or `{mark - x}` plus `{mark - y}`, and the condition `mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set` is satisfied. The variable `y_found` remains `False`.***
