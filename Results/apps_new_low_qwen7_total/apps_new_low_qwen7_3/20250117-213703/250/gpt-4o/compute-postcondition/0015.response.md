Postcondition: ***`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` (next element), `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True` and `x_found` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `y_found` remains unchanged.***
