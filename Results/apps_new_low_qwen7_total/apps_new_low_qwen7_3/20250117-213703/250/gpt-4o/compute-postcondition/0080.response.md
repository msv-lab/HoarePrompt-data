The code `result.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `result`. However, the value of `y` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify its exact value. But we know that `y` is not `None` because if it were `None`, appending it would not change the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` remains `False`, `new_marks` will remain an empty list, `result` is now a list containing `y`.**
