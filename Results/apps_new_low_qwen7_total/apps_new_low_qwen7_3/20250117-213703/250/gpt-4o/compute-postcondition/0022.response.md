Postcondition: ***`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` excluding the current `mark` plus one, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark` and the new `mark`, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` remains unchanged. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` remains `True`; otherwise, `y_found` remains unchanged.***
