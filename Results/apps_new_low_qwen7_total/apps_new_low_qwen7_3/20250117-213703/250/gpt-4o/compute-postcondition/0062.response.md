`new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` and `x` are not defined in the initial state, they are assumed to be arbitrary values. The values of `marks`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark - x`**
