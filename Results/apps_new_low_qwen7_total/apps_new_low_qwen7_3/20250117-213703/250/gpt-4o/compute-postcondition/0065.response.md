Postcondition: ***`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, and `y_found` is `False`. `new_marks` contains one of the following elements: 
- `mark_0 + x` if `mark + x + y in marks_set` or `mark + x - y in marks_set` or `mark - x + y in marks_set`.
- `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` if they exist in `marks_set` and none of the above conditions are met.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of `new_marks` after the execution of the if-else block, while retaining the conditions specified in the precondition.
