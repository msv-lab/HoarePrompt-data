`new_marks` is created and adds the value `mark + x`. The variable `x_found` remains unchanged, and the condition about `marks_set` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `marks` must be defined and contain at least one element, `x_found` is still False, `new_marks` contains `mark + x`, and either `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`.
