Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` remains `False`, and `new_marks` will contain one of the following elements based on the conditions checked within the loop:  
- If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark + y`.  
- If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark - y`.  
- If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain `mark + x`.  
- If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` will contain either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y`.**

This output state summarizes the possible final values of `new_marks` after the loop has executed, given the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False` if the respective conditions were never met during the loop's execution.
