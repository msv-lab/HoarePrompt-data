Output State: **marks must contain at least one element, x_found remains False, y_found remains False, new_marks is now an empty set**.

Explanation:
1. The first `print(1)` statement prints `1` but does not affect any variables.
2. The second `print(new_marks.pop())` statement attempts to print and remove an element from `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is initially not empty (due to the precondition), it will pop an element and print it. After this operation, `new_marks` becomes an empty set.

Given the conditions for constructing `new_marks`:
- If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`.
- If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y`.

However, since `new_marks` ends up being empty after popping an element, these conditions do not apply to the final state. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as stated above.
