The code `y_found = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. This does not affect the values of `mark`, `x`, or `marks_set`. The value of `x_found` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not reference or modify `x_found`.

Output State: **`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` (next element), `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` remains unchanged.**
