Postcondition: ***`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` excluding the current `mark` plus one, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark` and the new `mark`, `y_found` remains unchanged, and `x_found` is `True` if either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. Otherwise, `x_found` remains unchanged.***
