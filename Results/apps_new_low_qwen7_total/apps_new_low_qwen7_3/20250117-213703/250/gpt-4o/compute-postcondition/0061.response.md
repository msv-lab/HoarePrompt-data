The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` attempts to add `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mark` and `x`. Since `marks` must contain at least one element, let's denote the first element in `marks` as `mark_0`. Without knowing the exact value of `x`, we can only say that `mark + x` is added to `new_marks`. The values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element; `x_found` is `False`; `y_found` is `False`; `new_marks` contains at least one element which is `mark_0 + x`**
