The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `x_found`. This does not affect the values of `mark` or `x`, nor does it change the definition of `marks_set`. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `x_found`, which is now `True`.

Output State: **`mark` is an integer from the set `marks_set` (next element), `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is the set of integers excluding the current `mark`, `x_found` is `True`**
