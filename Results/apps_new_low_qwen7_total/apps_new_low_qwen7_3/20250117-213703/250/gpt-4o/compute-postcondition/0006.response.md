The code `y_found = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. This assignment does not affect the values of `mark`, `x`, `marks_set`, or `x_found`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `y_found`.

Output State: **`mark` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `marks_set` is a set of integers, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`.**
