The code adds `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is a set, it automatically ensures there are no duplicate values. Given the initial conditions, `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False` because the code does not change their values. The value of `marks` is unchanged because the code does not interact with it directly.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark + y`**
