The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` is a set, adding an element that already exists in the set does not change the set, but since the initial state specifies that `new_marks` contains one of the elements based on certain conditions, we need to consider those conditions.

Given the initial state, `new_marks` can contain elements based on the conditions specified. After adding `mark + y` to `new_marks`, the set `new_marks` will include this new element.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `marks` remains unchanged.
- `x_found` remains `False`.
- `y_found` remains `False`.
- `new_marks` now includes `mark + y`.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` contains `mark + y`.**
