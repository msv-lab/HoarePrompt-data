Let's analyze the given example step by step:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `marks` must contain at least one element.
  - `x_found` is `False`.
  - `y_found` is `False`.
  - `new_marks` remains unchanged if neither `mark + y + x` nor `mark + y - x` nor `mark - y + x` nor `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for mark in marks:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `mark`, which iterates over the elements in `marks`.
   - There are no other variables in the loop head.

2. **Determine State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop only iterates over the elements in `marks`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `mark`.
   - After each iteration, `mark` takes the next value from `marks`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `marks` must contain at least one element.
   - `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop itself.
   - `new_marks` remains unchanged if none of the conditions are met, but since we are looking at the start of the next iteration, `new_marks` will remain unchanged unless a condition is met during the current iteration.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `mark` to take the next element from `marks`. The other states (`x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

### Final State:
**`marks` must contain at least one element (the next element will be used in the next iteration), `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` remains unchanged.**

**State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` remains unchanged**.
