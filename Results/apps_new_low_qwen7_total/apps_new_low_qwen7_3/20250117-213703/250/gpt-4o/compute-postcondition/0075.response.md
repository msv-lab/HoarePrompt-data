The code initializes an empty list named `result`. This does not affect the values of `marks`, `x_found`, `y_found`, or `new_marks`. The only change is that `result` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` remains `False`, `new_marks` will remain an empty list, `result` is an empty list**
