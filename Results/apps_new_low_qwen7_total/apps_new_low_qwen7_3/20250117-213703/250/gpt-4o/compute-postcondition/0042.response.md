The code adds `mark + y` to `new_marks`. Given the initial conditions, `new_marks` was either `{mark + x}` or `{mark - x}`, and now it includes `mark + y`.

Since `marks_set` contains either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y`, and `y_found` remains `False`, the presence of `mark + y` in `new_marks` does not affect these conditions.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`marks` must be defined and contain at least one element, `x_found` remains `False`, and `new_marks` is either `{mark + x, mark + y}` or `{mark - x, mark + y}`. Additionally, either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`. The variable `y_found` remains `False`. Either `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set` after entering the if condition.**
