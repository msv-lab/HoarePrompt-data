To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and analyze each part:

1. **Variables Defined:**
   - `n`: Undefined
   - `l`: Undefined
   - `x`: An integer
   - `y`: An integer
   - `marks_set`: A subset of the original `marks_set`
   - `x_found`: Boolean (False)
   - `y_found`: Boolean (False)
   - `new_marks`: An empty set

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for mark in marks:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the `marks` iterable. This means that `marks` must be defined and must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `marks_set` is mentioned as a subset of the original `marks_set`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `x`, `y`, `x_found`, and `y_found` are not directly related to the loop execution since they are not used in the loop header.
   - `new_marks` being an empty set does not affect the loop execution.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `marks` must be defined and contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

**State: **`marks` must be defined and contain at least one element**
