Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible ways to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y`. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

According to the problem statement, we need to check if we can measure both `x` (185) and `y` (230) with the existing marks or with the addition of the minimum number of marks. The existing marks are `[0, 185, 250]`.

The program incorrectly checks if either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in the set, and similarly for `y`. However, it does not handle cases where neither `mark + x` nor `mark - x` is directly found but a combination of `x` and `y` might be achievable by adding one mark.

In the given example, the program would output `1` and `230`, which is incorrect because adding just one mark at `230` is sufficient to measure `230` but does not help in measuring `185` directly.

A more comprehensive approach would involve checking all possible combinations of `x` and `y` and determining the minimum number of additional marks needed to cover both distances. The current implementation does not fully explore all possible combinations and may miss the optimal solution in certain cases.
