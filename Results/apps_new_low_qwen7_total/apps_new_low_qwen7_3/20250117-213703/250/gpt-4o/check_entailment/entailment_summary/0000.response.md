Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to check if the ruler can already measure `x` and `y` distances using existing marks.
- If not, we need to find the minimum number of additional marks required to measure both `x` and `y`.
- The program should output the count of these additional marks and their positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values and marks.
   
2. **Checking Existing Marks:**
   - It uses a set to store the marks for quick lookup.
   - It iterates through the marks to check if `x` and `y` can be measured by adding or subtracting `x` or `y` from the current mark.
   - This logic checks for possible pairs that could measure `x` and `y`.

3. **Handling Found Cases:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are found, it prints `0` indicating no new marks needed.
   
4. **Finding New Marks:**
   - It then tries to find additional marks to measure `x` and `y` if not found initially.
   - It uses a set to keep track of potential new marks.
   - It checks combinations of existing marks and `x`, `y` to see if new marks can be derived.
   
5. **Outputting Results:**
   - If any new marks are found, it prints `1` and one of the new marks.
   - If no new marks are found, it calculates the required marks directly and prints their count and positions.

### Testing Against Provided Examples:
- **Example 1:** 
  - Input: `3 250 185 230` with marks `[0, 185, 250]`
  - Expected Output: `1 230`
  - The program correctly identifies that adding `230` allows measuring `x` and `y`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4 250 185 230` with marks `[0, 20, 185, 250]`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - The program correctly identifies that all necessary marks are already present.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2 300 185 230` with marks `[0, 300]`
  - Expected Output: `2 185 230`
  - The program correctly identifies that adding `185` and `230` allows measuring `x` and `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to handle all scenarios correctly based on the examples provided. It checks for existing marks and calculates new ones as necessary.

**Correctness: True**
