The code initializes a list `right_product` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `total_product`, or the contents of the `cards` list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each card a_i in the list. The total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`; `right_product` is a list of `n + 1` elements, all equal to 1.**
