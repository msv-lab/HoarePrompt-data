The code `left_product *= cards[x]` multiplies the current value of `left_product` by `cards[x]`. Given that `left_product` was previously updated to `left_product * cards[0]`, this means `left_product` now becomes `left_product * cards[0] * cards[x]`.

The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `valid_ways`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `left_product` is left_product * cards[0] * cards[x], and `valid_ways` remains unchanged.**
