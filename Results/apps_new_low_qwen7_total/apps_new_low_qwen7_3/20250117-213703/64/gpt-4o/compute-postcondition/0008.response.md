The code updates the value of `right_product[i]` to be the product of `right_product[i + 1]` and `cards[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, so the updated value of `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is \(n - 2\), `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`**
