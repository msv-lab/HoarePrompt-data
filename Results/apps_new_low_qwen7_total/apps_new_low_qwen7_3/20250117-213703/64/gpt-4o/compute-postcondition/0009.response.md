Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `i` is \(n - 2\).
   - `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i = -1`.

4. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was \(n - 2\). Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be \(n - 3\).
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `i` is now \(n - 3\).
   - `right_product[i]` is still defined based on the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is \(n - 3\), `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`**
