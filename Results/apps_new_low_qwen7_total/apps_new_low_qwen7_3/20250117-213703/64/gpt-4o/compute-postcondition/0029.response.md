Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the `cards` list), `k` (a positive integer), and `cards` (a list of positive integers). It first checks if the product of all elements in `cards` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subarrays where the product of elements in the subarray is divisible by `k` and returns this count. Specifically, it computes two arrays, `right_product` and `left_product`, to efficiently determine the product of elements in any subarray and checks if the product of elements in the current subarray is divisible by `k`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is greater than the product of all elements in `cards`, the function will still correctly return 0 since the initial check ensures divisibility.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle cases where the elements in `cards` might have a product that is divisible by `k` due to repeated factors, which could lead to overcounting or incorrect results without further optimization. However, given the constraints and the problem statement, the current logic appears to cover the necessary cases.
