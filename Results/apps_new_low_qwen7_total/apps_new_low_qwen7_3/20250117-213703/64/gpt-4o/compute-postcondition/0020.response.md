Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `left_product` is updated to `left_product * cards[0]`, and `valid_ways` is increased by 1 if `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `left_product` is updated to `left_product * cards[0]`, and `valid_ways` remains unchanged.***
