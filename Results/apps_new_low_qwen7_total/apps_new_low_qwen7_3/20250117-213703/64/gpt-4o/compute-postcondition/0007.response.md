Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Initial Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates from `i = n - 1` down to `i = 0` with a step of `-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to decrease by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n - 2`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `right_product[i]` will change in the loop body, but since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `right_product` here.

6. **Conclusion**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is \(n - 2\), `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`**.
