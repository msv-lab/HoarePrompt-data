`right_product[i]` is assigned the value of `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`. Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and `i` is n-1, the value of `i` becomes n-1. Since `i` is n-1, `i + 1` would be n, which is out of bounds for the list `right_product` if it's indexed from 0 to n-1. However, since the code attempts to access `right_product[i + 1]`, and assuming `right_product` is properly defined and initialized up to index `n-1`, the value of `right_product[i]` is updated based on the formula. The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `i` is n-1; `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`.**
