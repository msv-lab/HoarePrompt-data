`valid_ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `n`, `left_product`, and `right_product[x + 1]` remain unchanged, and the condition that their product modulo `k` equals 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `valid_ways` is 1 more than its original value, `left_product` and `right_product[x + 1]` are such that their product modulo `k` equals 0**
