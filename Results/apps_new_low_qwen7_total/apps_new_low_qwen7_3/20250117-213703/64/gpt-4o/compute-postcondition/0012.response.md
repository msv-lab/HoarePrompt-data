Given the initial state and the provided code block, let's analyze the effects of each line on the program's variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `i` is \(-1\)
- `right_product` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where `right_product[0]` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and for \(1 \leq j \leq n\), `right_product[j]` is the product of all elements in `cards` starting from `cards[j]` to `cards[n-1]`.

Code Block:
```
valid_ways = 0
left_product = 1
```

Analysis:
1. `valid_ways = 0`: This initializes `valid_ways` to 0.
2. `left_product = 1`: This initializes `left_product` to 1.

Since no further operations are performed on these variables or on `i` or `right_product`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), i is -1, right_product is a list of \(n + 1\) elements, valid_ways is 0, left_product is 1**
