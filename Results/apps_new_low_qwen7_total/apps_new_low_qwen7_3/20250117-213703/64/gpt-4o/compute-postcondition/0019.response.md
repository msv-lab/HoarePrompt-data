`valid_ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, and `left_product` is updated to `left_product * cards[0]`, which means `left_product` has been modified but its exact value is not specified. The state of `valid_ways` is now increased by 1 from whatever its previous value was.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `left_product` is updated to `left_product * cards[0]`, `valid_ways` is increased by 1**
