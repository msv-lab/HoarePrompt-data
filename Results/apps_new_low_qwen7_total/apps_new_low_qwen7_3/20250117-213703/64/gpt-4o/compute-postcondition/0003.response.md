Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each card a_i in the list. The total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`.***
