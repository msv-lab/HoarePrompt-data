The code updates the value of `right_product[i]` to `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`. Given the initial state where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `i` is `n - 3`, and `right_product[i]` is already defined as `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`, the code reassigns `right_product[i]` to itself, which means the value of `right_product[i]` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `i` is \(n - 3\); `right_product[i]` is `right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]`**
