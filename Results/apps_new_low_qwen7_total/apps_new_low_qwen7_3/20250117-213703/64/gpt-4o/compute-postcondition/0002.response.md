Functionality: **The function `product` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the product of all integers in the list. It uses the `reduce` function to multiply all elements in `arr`. The function will handle cases where `arr` contains integers between 1 and \(10^9\), inclusive, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100,000. However, the function does not include any checks for empty lists or non-integer elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the function will return 1, as the identity element for multiplication. If `arr` contains non-integer elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.**
