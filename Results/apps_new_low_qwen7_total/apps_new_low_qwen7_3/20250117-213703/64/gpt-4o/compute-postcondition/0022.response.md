Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `x` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `left_product` is updated to `left_product * cards[0] * cards[x]`
   - `valid_ways` remains unchanged

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The variable `x` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, making it `x = 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `x` should be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0 and `x` is now 2, the loop will continue if `n > 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` will be 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
   - `left_product` is updated based on the current value of `x`, so it will be updated to `left_product * cards[0] * cards[2]`.
   - `valid_ways` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `left_product` is left_product * cards[0] * cards[2], and `valid_ways` remains unchanged**
