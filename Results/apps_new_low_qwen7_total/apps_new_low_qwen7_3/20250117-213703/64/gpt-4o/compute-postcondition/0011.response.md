Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`.
   - `cards` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each card \(a_i\) in the list.
   - `right_product` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements, all initially equal to 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. For each iteration, it updates the `right_product` list according to the formula:
   ```python
   right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
   ```

3. **Tracking Variable Changes:**
   - **Invariants:** The variable `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - **Updating Variables:** The `right_product` list is updated based on the current value of `cards[i]` and the previous value of `right_product[i + 1]`.

4. **Describing Loop Behavior:**
   - After the first iteration (`i = n-1`), `right_product[n-1]` becomes `cards[n-1]`.
   - After the second iteration (`i = n-2`), `right_product[n-2]` becomes `right_product[n-1] * cards[n-2] = cards[n-1] * cards[n-2]`.
   - This pattern continues until the last iteration where `i = 0`, and `right_product[0]` becomes the product of all elements in `cards`.

5. **Final Values:**
   - The loop will execute exactly `n` times because it starts at `i = n-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`.
   - After all iterations, the `right_product` list will be fully populated as follows:
     - `right_product[0] = cards[0] * cards[1] * ... * cards[n-1]`
     - `right_product[1] = cards[1] * ... * cards[n-1]`
     - ...
     - `right_product[n] = 1`
   - The final state of `i` will be `-1` because the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied after the last iteration.

6. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop always executes `n` times regardless of the values of `n` and `k` since the loop is controlled by the index `i` ranging from `n-1` to `0`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `i` is \(-1\); `right_product` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where `right_product[0]` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and for \(1 \leq j \leq n\), `right_product[j]` is the product of all elements in `cards` starting from `cards[j]` to `cards[n-1]`.**
