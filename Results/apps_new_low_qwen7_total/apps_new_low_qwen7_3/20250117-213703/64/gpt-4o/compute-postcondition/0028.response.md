The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- `cards` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each card \(a_i\) in the list.

The function has two cases:
- **Case_1**: The program returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `valid_ways`, which is incremented by the number of times the condition `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` holds true.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `cards`, and return either 0 or the count of valid ways where `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` holds true. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `cards`, and returns 0 or the count of valid ways where `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` holds true.**
