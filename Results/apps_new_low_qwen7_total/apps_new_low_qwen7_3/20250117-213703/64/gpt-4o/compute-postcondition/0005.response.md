Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`k`, `total_product`, `cards`, and `right_product`) are not directly controlling the loop's execution.

2. **Determine the initial condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - The loop will execute the first time when `i` is set to `n-1`.

3. **State the conditions**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to start executing.

Given the constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`
- Therefore, `0 ≤ n-1 < n ≤ 100,000`

Since `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases to `0`, the loop will execute as long as `n-1` is a valid index, which it always will be given the constraints on `n`.

So, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `i` should be `n-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `i` is n-1**
