 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
cards = list(map(int, data[2:]))
print(func_1(n, k, cards))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the `cards` list), `k` (a positive integer), and `cards` (a list of positive integers). It first checks if the product of all elements in `cards` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subarrays where the product of elements in the subarray is divisible by `k` and returns this count. Specifically, it computes two arrays, `right_product` and `left_product`, to efficiently determine the product of elements in any subarray and checks if the product of elements in the current subarray is divisible by `k`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `lcm` takes two parameters, `a` (a list of positive integers) and `b` (a positive integer). However, the provided code snippet only includes the definition of a helper function `lcm` which calculates the least common multiple of two numbers, but it is not used in the given code. The actual function does not use the `lcm` helper function. Instead, it computes the product of the first element in the list `a` and the second parameter `b`, then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first element in `a` and `b`. The function returns this result. If `a` is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately by returning 0 or raising an error, depending on the intended behavior.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `product` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the product of all integers in the list. It uses the `reduce` function to multiply all elements in `arr`. The function will handle cases where `arr` contains integers between 1 and \(10^9\), inclusive, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100,000. However, the function does not include any checks for empty lists or non-integer elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the function will return 1, as the identity element for multiplication. If `arr` contains non-integer elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
