Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the number of ways to remove `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom of the deck such that the remaining deck's product of card values is divisible by `k`.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calculates the product of all card values (`total_product`) and checks if it is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0, indicating no valid way exists.
   - It then creates an array `right_product` to store the product of elements from the end of the list to each position.
   - For each possible `x` (from 0 to `n-1`), it calculates the product of elements from index `x+1` to the end of the list using `right_product` and checks if it is divisible by `k`. If so, it increments the count of valid ways.
   - The function correctly uses the `left_product` variable to accumulate the product of elements from the start of the list up to index `x`.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`lcm`)**:
   - This function is defined but not used in the code. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Since it is not referenced in the main logic of `func_1`, its presence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Analyzing Function 3 (`product`)**:
   - This function calculates the product of all elements in a list using the `reduce` function.
   - While the function itself is correct and efficient for the given constraints, it is not directly used in `func_1`. However, the logic of calculating products is already implemented in `func_1` using the same method (i.e., multiplying elements in a list).

5. **Overall Logic Verification**:
   - The approach in `func_1` is sound and directly addresses the problem statement.
   - The handling of the product calculation and divisibility check is correctly implemented.
   - The code efficiently iterates through possible values of `x` and uses precomputed products to avoid redundant calculations.

Given that the provided functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem and the logic within `func_1` is correct, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
