You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

def func_1(n, k, cards):
    total_product = product(cards)
    if (total_product % k != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `total_product` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and `cards` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each card a_i in the list. The total product of `cards` is divisible by `k`.
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `i` is \(-1\); `right_product` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where `right_product[0]` is the product of all elements in `cards`, and for \(1 \leq j \leq n\), `right_product[j]` is the product of all elements in `cards` starting from `cards[j]` to `cards[n-1]`.
    valid_ways = 0

left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        
        left_product *= cards[x]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is `n-1`, `left_product` is `cards[0] * cards[1] * ... * cards[n-1]`, `valid_ways` is incremented by the number of times the condition `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` holds true.
    return valid_ways
    #`The program returns valid_ways which is incremented by the number of times the condition left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0 holds true`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the `cards` list), `k` (a positive integer), and `cards` (a list of positive integers). It first checks if the product of all elements in `cards` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subarrays where the product of elements in the subarray is divisible by `k` and returns this count. Specifically, it computes two arrays, `right_product` and `left_product`, to efficiently determine the product of elements in any subarray and checks if the product of elements in the current subarray is divisible by `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers, representing the numbers on the cards in the deck, and n is a positive integer representing the length of the deck. k is a positive integer representing the magic number.
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of the first `a[0]` elements in list `a` divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first `a[0]` elements in list `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `lcm` takes two parameters, `a` (a list of positive integers) and `b` (a positive integer). However, the provided code snippet only includes the definition of a helper function `lcm` which calculates the least common multiple of two numbers, but it is not used in the given code. The actual function does not use the `lcm` helper function. Instead, it computes the product of the first element in the list `a` and the second parameter `b`, then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first element in `a` and `b`. The function returns this result. If `a` is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately by returning 0 or raising an error, depending on the intended behavior.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
    #The program returns the product of all integers in list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `product` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the product of all integers in the list. It uses the `reduce` function to multiply all elements in `arr`. The function will handle cases where `arr` contains integers between 1 and \(10^9\), inclusive, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100,000. However, the function does not include any checks for empty lists or non-integer elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the function will return 1, as the identity element for multiplication. If `arr` contains non-integer elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total product of the deck is not divisible by \( k \). According to the problem description, if the total product of all numbers in the original deck is not divisible by \( k \), then there are no valid ways to choose \( x \) and \( y \) such that the resulting deck is valid. However, the provided solution returns 0 without considering this condition, which is incorrect. 

To fix this, the program should first check if the total product of the deck is divisible by \( k \). If it is not, the function should return 0 immediately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    
    return valid_ways

# Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
```

By adding the initial check, the program will correctly handle the case where the total product is not divisible by \( k \).
