### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Total Product Calculation**:
   - The function first calculates the total product of all elements in the deck (`total_product`).
   - If `total_product % k != 0`, the function immediately returns 0, indicating no valid ways to choose `x` and `y`.

2. **Right Product Calculation**:
   - A list `right_product` is initialized with 1s, and for each index `i` from `n-1` to 0, `right_product[i]` is set to the product of elements from `i` to `n-1`.
   - This ensures that `right_product[i]` contains the product of elements from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Valid Ways Calculation**:
   - A variable `valid_ways` is initialized to 0.
   - For each `x` from 0 to `n-1`, `left_product` is updated to the product of elements from `0` to `x-1` (if `x > 0`), and the condition `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition holds, `valid_ways` is incremented.

4. **Return Valid Ways**:
   - The function returns the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs.

#### Supporting Functions:
- **`lcm`**:
  - This function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`. However, this function is not used in the main logic, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution.

- **`product`**:
  - This function calculates the product of all elements in a list using `reduce` and `lambda`. It correctly handles the product calculation, ensuring that the result is within the specified bounds.

#### Edge Cases and Combinations:
- The solution correctly handles the case where the total product is not divisible by `k` by returning 0 immediately.
- The solution iterates through all possible values of `x` and checks the condition for each combination of `x` and `y` (which ranges from 0 to `n-x-1`).

#### Complexity Analysis:
- The solution runs in \(O(n)\) time complexity due to the single-pass calculations for `right_product` and the subsequent pass for determining valid `(x, y)` pairs.
- This efficiency is suitable given the constraint \(n \leq 100,000\).

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at various points, validating the logical flow of the solution.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, the solution correctly implements the required logic to find the number of valid `(x, y)` pairs such that the product of the remaining cards is divisible by `k`. The provided implementation handles all edge cases and performs the necessary calculations efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
