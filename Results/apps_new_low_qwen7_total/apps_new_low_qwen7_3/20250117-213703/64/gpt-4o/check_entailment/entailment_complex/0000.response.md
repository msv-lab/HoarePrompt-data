Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total product of the entire deck and checks if it is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0, which is correct.
   - It then creates a list `right_product` that stores the product of elements from the end of the deck to the start. This is necessary for efficient calculation of products of subarrays.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` (from 0 to `n-1`) and uses the precomputed `right_product` to calculate the product of elements from position `x+1` to the end of the deck.
   - It correctly increments `valid_ways` whenever the product of the subarray is divisible by `k`.
   - The logic is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.

2. **Function `lcm` Analysis**:
   - The function `lcm` is defined but not used in the main logic of the program. Since it is not referenced in the main function, it can be considered unnecessary for the correctness of the program. The program works fine without it.

3. **Function `product` Analysis**:
   - The function `product` computes the product of all elements in a list using the `reduce` function, which is appropriate for the problem. It handles the edge case of an empty list by returning 1.
   - The function is well-defined and correctly implements the required functionality.

Given the above analysis, the program is logically sound and meets the problem requirements. All necessary steps are correctly implemented and the logic is consistent with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
