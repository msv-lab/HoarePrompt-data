Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided solution:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total product of the deck and checks if it is divisible by `k`.
   - It initializes `right_product` such that `right_product[i]` holds the product of elements from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - It iterates through possible values of `x`, calculating the left product and checking if the product of the subarray from `x+1` to `n-y` (where `y` can be 0 to `n-x-1`) is divisible by `k`.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `right_product` ensures that each element is correctly set to the product of its right side.
   - The loop over `x` correctly calculates the left product and checks the condition for validity.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the total product might not be divisible by `k` initially, returning 0 immediately.
   - The solution correctly accounts for all combinations of `x` and `y` without redundancy.

4. **Supporting Functions**:
   - `lcm` is not used in the main logic but is provided as an additional utility function.
   - `product` correctly computes the product of an array using `reduce`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The solution runs in O(n) time due to single-pass computations for `right_product` and another pass for determining valid `(x, y)` pairs.
   - This is efficient given the constraints (n <= 100,000).

Given the above analysis, the solution appears to correctly implement the required logic for finding valid `(x, y)` pairs.

Correctness: **True**
