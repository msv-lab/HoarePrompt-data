You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce


    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways

#Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `product` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the product of all integers in the list. It uses the `reduce` function to multiply all elements in `arr`. The function will handle cases where `arr` contains integers between 1 and \(10^9\), inclusive, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100,000. However, the function does not include any checks for empty lists or non-integer elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the function will return 1, as the identity element for multiplication. If `arr` contains non-integer elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total product of the deck is not divisible by \( k \). According to the problem description, if the total product of all numbers in the original deck is not divisible by \( k \), then there are no valid ways to choose \( x \) and \( y \) such that the resulting deck is valid. However, the provided solution returns 0 without considering this condition, which is incorrect. 

To fix this, the program should first check if the total product of the deck is divisible by \( k \). If it is not, the function should return 0 immediately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    
    return valid_ways

# Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
```

By adding the initial check, the program will correctly handle the case where the total product is not divisible by \( k \).
