### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the given function summaries.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - Vova needs to determine the number of ways to choose \(x\) and \(y\) such that the remaining deck (after removing \(x\) cards from the top and \(y\) cards from the bottom) is valid. A deck is valid if the product of the numbers on the remaining cards is divisible by \(k\).
   - The solution should first check if the total product of the original deck is divisible by \(k\). If not, the answer is 0 since no valid ways exist.
   - The provided function `func_1` already includes this check at the beginning, which is correct.

2. **Function Summaries Analysis**:
   - The `product` function computes the product of a list of integers using the `reduce` function. This function is expected to work correctly for the input constraints.
   - The `lcm` function is not used in the given solution, so we can ignore it for this analysis.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function starts by computing the total product of the deck using the `product` function.
   - It checks if the total product is divisible by \(k\). If not, it returns 0, which is correct.
   - If the total product is divisible by \(k\), it proceeds to calculate the number of valid ways to choose \(x\) and \(y\).
     - It initializes a list `right_product` to store the product of the cards from the end of the deck.
     - It iterates through each card from the start of the deck, maintaining the product of the left side (`left_product`) and checking if the product of the left and right parts is divisible by \(k\).
     - This approach is correct as it ensures that the remaining deck is valid for each combination of \(x\) and \(y\).

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the condition where the total product of the deck is not divisible by \(k\), and the logic for counting valid ways is sound.
