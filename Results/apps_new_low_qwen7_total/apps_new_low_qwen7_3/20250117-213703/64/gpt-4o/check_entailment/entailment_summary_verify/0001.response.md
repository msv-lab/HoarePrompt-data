Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description, the function summaries, and the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total product of the deck and checks if it is divisible by `k`.
   - It initializes `right_product` such that `right_product[i]` holds the product of elements from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - It iterates through possible values of `x`, calculating the left product and checking if the product of the subarray from `x+1` to `n-y` (where `y` can be 0 to `n-x-1`) is divisible by `k`.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `right_product` ensures that each element is correctly set to the product of its right side.
   - The loop over `x` correctly calculates the left product and checks the condition for validity.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the total product might not be divisible by `k` initially, returning 0 immediately.
   - The solution correctly accounts for all combinations of `x` and `y` without redundancy.

4. **Supporting Functions**:
   - `lcm` is not used in the main logic but is provided as an additional utility function.
   - `product` correctly computes the product of an array using `reduce`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The solution runs in O(n) time due to single-pass computations for `right_product` and another pass for determining valid `(x, y)` pairs.
   - This is efficient given the constraints (n <= 100,000).

However, let's scrutinize the logic for correctness:

- The function `func_1` assumes that the total product of the entire deck is already divisible by `k` before entering the loop. This assumption might not hold true in all cases. For instance, if the total product is not divisible by `k`, the function will still proceed with the calculation of `right_product`, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The function should explicitly check if the total product is divisible by `k` and return 0 if it is not, rather than proceeding with the calculations.
- The function does not handle cases where the product of the remaining cards after removing `x` cards from the top and `y` cards from the bottom might still not be divisible by `k`.

To ensure correctness, we need to add a check at the beginning of the function to verify if the total product is divisible by `k`. If not, the function should return 0 immediately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    from math import gcd
    from functools import reduce

    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    return valid_ways
```

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is partially correct but needs a small adjustment to ensure the function behaves correctly in all cases.

Final: **False**
