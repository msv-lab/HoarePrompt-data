### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Variables Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes variables \( n \) and \( k \) with the number of cards and the magic number, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list of card values.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total product of all cards.
   - If the total product is not divisible by \( k \), the function returns 0 immediately, which is correct.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the right product of the cards.
   - It then iterates through the cards to compute the number of valid ways to remove cards from the top and bottom such that the remaining product is divisible by \( k \).

3. **Right Product Calculation**:
   - The right product array is correctly initialized and populated, ensuring that each element represents the product of the subarray starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list.

4. **Valid Ways Calculation**:
   - The loop correctly computes the left product and checks if the product of the current left and right products is divisible by \( k \).
   - This ensures that the product of the remaining cards after removing \( x \) cards from the top and \( y \) cards from the bottom is divisible by \( k \).

5. **Function Calls and Output**:
   - The program correctly calls `func_1` and prints its result, which is the number of valid ways to remove cards.

### Conclusion:

Given the logical flow and correctness of the calculations, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
