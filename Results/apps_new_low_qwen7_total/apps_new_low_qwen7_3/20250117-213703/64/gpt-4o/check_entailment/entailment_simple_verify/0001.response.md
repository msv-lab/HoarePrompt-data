### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by calculating the total product of the entire deck using the `product` function. If this total product is not divisible by `k`, it immediately returns 0. This check is necessary because if the total product is already divisible by `k`, any subset of cards taken from the deck must also be valid.
   - Next, it initializes `right_product`, which stores the product of elements from index `i` to `n-1`. This helps in quickly calculating the product of the remaining cards after removing `x` cards from the top.
   - The function then iterates over possible values of `x` and calculates the left product (`left_product`). For each `x`, it checks if the product of the remaining cards (from `x+1` to `n-1`) is divisible by `k` by verifying if `left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0`.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `right_product` is done correctly. It starts from the last element and moves backwards, ensuring that `right_product[i]` is the product of elements from `i` to `n-1`.
   - The loop over `x` correctly calculates the left product and checks the condition for validity. This ensures that all valid `(x, y)` pairs are counted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the total product is not divisible by `k` by returning 0 immediately.
   - The solution accounts for all possible values of `x` and `y` without redundancy, ensuring that every combination is checked.

4. **Supporting Functions**:
   - The `lcm` function is not used in the main logic but is provided as an additional utility function. Since it is not used, it does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The `product` function correctly computes the product of an array using `reduce`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The solution runs in O(n) time due to the single-pass computations for `right_product` and another pass for determining valid `(x, y)` pairs.
   - This is efficient given the constraints (n <= 100,000).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `(x, y)` pairs. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusions.

### Final:
**True**
