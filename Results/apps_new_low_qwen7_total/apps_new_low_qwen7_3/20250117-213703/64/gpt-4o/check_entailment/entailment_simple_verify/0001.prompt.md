You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.

The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number a_{i} is written on the i-th card in the deck.

After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.

Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers written on the cards.


-----Output-----

Print the number of ways to choose x and y so the resulting deck is valid.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
6 2 8

Output
4

Input
3 6
9 1 14

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the possible values of x and y are:

  x = 0, y = 0;  x = 1, y = 0;  x = 2, y = 0;  x = 0, y = 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided solution:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total product of the deck and checks if it is divisible by `k`.
   - It initializes `right_product` such that `right_product[i]` holds the product of elements from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - It iterates through possible values of `x`, calculating the left product and checking if the product of the subarray from `x+1` to `n-y` (where `y` can be 0 to `n-x-1`) is divisible by `k`.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The initialization of `right_product` ensures that each element is correctly set to the product of its right side.
   - The loop over `x` correctly calculates the left product and checks the condition for validity.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the total product might not be divisible by `k` initially, returning 0 immediately.
   - The solution correctly accounts for all combinations of `x` and `y` without redundancy.

4. **Supporting Functions**:
   - `lcm` is not used in the main logic but is provided as an additional utility function.
   - `product` correctly computes the product of an array using `reduce`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The solution runs in O(n) time due to single-pass computations for `right_product` and another pass for determining valid `(x, y)` pairs.
   - This is efficient given the constraints (n <= 100,000).

Given the above analysis, the solution appears to correctly implement the required logic for finding valid `(x, y)` pairs.
