Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total product of the deck is not divisible by \( k \). According to the problem description, if the total product of all numbers in the original deck is not divisible by \( k \), then there are no valid ways to choose \( x \) and \( y \) such that the resulting deck is valid. However, the provided solution returns 0 without considering this condition, which is incorrect. 

To fix this, the program should first check if the total product of the deck is divisible by \( k \). If it is not, the function should return 0 immediately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, cards):
    total_product = product(cards)
    if total_product % k != 0:
        return 0
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    right_product = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        right_product[i] = right_product[i + 1] * cards[i]
    
    valid_ways = 0
    left_product = 1
    for x in range(n):
        if left_product * right_product[x + 1] % k == 0:
            valid_ways += 1
        left_product *= cards[x]
    
    return valid_ways

# Function 2:
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Function 3:
def product(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, arr, 1)
```

By adding the initial check, the program will correctly handle the case where the total product is not divisible by \( k \).
