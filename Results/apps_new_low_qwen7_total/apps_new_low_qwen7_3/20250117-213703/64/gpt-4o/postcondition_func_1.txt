The function `lcm` takes two parameters, `a` (a list of positive integers) and `b` (a positive integer). However, the provided code snippet only includes the definition of a helper function `lcm` which calculates the least common multiple of two numbers, but it is not used in the given code. The actual function does not use the `lcm` helper function. Instead, it computes the product of the first element in the list `a` and the second parameter `b`, then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first element in `a` and `b`. The function returns this result. If `a` is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately by returning 0 or raising an error, depending on the intended behavior.
