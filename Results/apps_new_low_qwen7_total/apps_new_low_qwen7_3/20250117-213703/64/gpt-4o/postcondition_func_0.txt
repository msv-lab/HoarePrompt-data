The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the `cards` list), `k` (a positive integer), and `cards` (a list of positive integers). It first checks if the product of all elements in `cards` is divisible by `k`. If not, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subarrays where the product of elements in the subarray is divisible by `k` and returns this count. Specifically, it computes two arrays, `right_product` and `left_product`, to efficiently determine the product of elements in any subarray and checks if the product of elements in the current subarray is divisible by `k`.
