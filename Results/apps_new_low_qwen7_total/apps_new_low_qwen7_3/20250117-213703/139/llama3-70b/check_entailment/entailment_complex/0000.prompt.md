Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, b, c are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

k = 4 - n % 4
    if (k == 4) :
        k = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `k` equals 4 - n % 4. If `k` equals 4, then `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `k = 4 - n \% 4` (with `k` being 0 if `n \% 4` equals 4), `ans` is the minimum value among all expressions `3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a` where `i` and `j` are integers satisfying `3 * i + 2 * j <= k`, `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration until it reaches the maximum possible value such that `3 * i + 2 * j <= k` holds.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes four non-negative integers \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\)) internally. It calculates the remainder \(k\) of \(n\) divided by 4, setting \(k\) to 0 if it equals 4. Then, it iterates over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\) to find the minimum value of the expression \(3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a\), where \(3i + 2j \leq k\). Finally, it prints the minimum value found. Potential edge cases include when \(n \% 4 = 4\), in which case \(k\) is set to 0. The function does not return any value directly but modifies and uses the internal variables \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(k\) to compute and print the result.
