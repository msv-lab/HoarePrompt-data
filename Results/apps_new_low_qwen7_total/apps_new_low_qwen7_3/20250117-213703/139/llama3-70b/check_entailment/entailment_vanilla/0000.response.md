### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Calculate Remaining Copies Needed**: 
   ```python
   k = 4 - n % 4
   ```
   This line calculates how many more copies Alyona needs to make the total number of copies a multiple of 4. If \( n \% 4 == 0 \), then \( k = 0 \). If not, \( k \) is set to the remainder needed to reach the next multiple of 4.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   ```python
   if k == 4:
       k = 0
   ```
   This checks if \( k \) is exactly 4, which means no additional copies are needed since \( n \) is already a multiple of 4.

4. **Dynamic Programming/Brute Force Approach**:
   ```python
   ans = float('inf')
   for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
       j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
       if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
           ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
   ```
   This loop iterates over possible combinations of buying packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the minimum cost. The logic ensures that the total number of copies added equals \( k \).

5. **Output the Result**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the constraints and the logic, this approach correctly considers all possible ways to buy the required number of additional copybooks at the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to handle all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum cost to achieve a multiple of 4 copies. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
