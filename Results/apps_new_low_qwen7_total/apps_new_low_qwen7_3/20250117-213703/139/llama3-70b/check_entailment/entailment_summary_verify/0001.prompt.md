You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little girl Alyona is in a shop to buy some copybooks for school. She study four subjects so she wants to have equal number of copybooks for each of the subjects. There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.

What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.


-----Input-----

The only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1 3 4

Output
3

Input
6 2 1 1

Output
1

Input
4 4 4 4

Output
0

Input
999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output
1000000000



-----Note-----

In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. 

In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.

In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.

In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
    k = 4 - n % 4
    if k == 4:
        k = 0
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
        j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
        if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
            ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes four non-negative integers \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\)) internally. It calculates the remainder \(k\) of \(n\) divided by 4, setting \(k\) to 0 if it equals 4. Then, it iterates over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\) to find the minimum value of the expression \(3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a\), where \(3i + 2j \leq k\). Finally, it prints the minimum value found. Potential edge cases include when \(n \% 4 = 4\), in which case \(k\) is set to 0. The function does not return any value directly but modifies and uses the internal variables \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(k\) to compute and print the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which reads four integers \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Calculate Remaining Copies Needed**: 
   ```python
   k = 4 - n % 4
   ```
   This line calculates how many more copies Alyona needs to make the total number of copies a multiple of 4. If \( n \% 4 == 0 \), then \( k = 0 \). If not, \( k \) is set to the remainder needed to reach the next multiple of 4.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   ```python
   if k == 4:
       k = 0
   ```
   This checks if \( k \) is exactly 4, which means no additional copies are needed since \( n \) is already a multiple of 4.

4. **Dynamic Programming/Brute Force Approach**:
   ```python
   ans = float('inf')
   for i in range(k // 3 + 1):
       j = (k - 3 * i) // 2
       if 3 * i + 2 * j <= k:
           ans = min(ans, 3 * i * c + j * b + (k - 3 * i - 2 * j) * a)
   ```
   This loop iterates over possible combinations of buying packs of 3, 2, and 1 copybooks to find the minimum cost. The logic ensures that the total number of copies added equals \( k \).

5. **Output the Result**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the constraints and the logic, this approach correctly considers all possible ways to buy the required number of additional copybooks at the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to handle all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum cost to achieve a multiple of 4 copies. Therefore, the program is correct.
