Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the minimum cost for Alyona to buy additional copybooks such that the total number of copybooks becomes divisible by 4. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads four integers \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input.
2. **Calculating Remainder**: It calculates the remainder \(k\) of \(n\) when divided by 4 using `k = 4 - n % 4`. This step ensures \(k\) is the smallest number needed to make \(n + k\) divisible by 4.
3. **Handling Edge Case**: If \(k = 4\), it sets \(k\) to 0 because \(n\) already ends in a way that makes it divisible by 4 without needing to buy any more books.
4. **Finding Minimum Cost**: The program then iterates over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\) (number of packs of 3 and 2 copybooks respectively) to minimize the cost. The condition \(3i + 2j \leq k\) ensures that the combination of these packs can meet the required number of additional copybooks \(k\).
5. **Cost Calculation**: For each valid combination of \(i\) and \(j\), it calculates the cost as \(3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a\) and updates the minimum cost accordingly.
6. **Printing Result**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost found.

This approach correctly handles all edge cases and ensures the minimum cost calculation for each scenario. The logic aligns with the problem statement and the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
