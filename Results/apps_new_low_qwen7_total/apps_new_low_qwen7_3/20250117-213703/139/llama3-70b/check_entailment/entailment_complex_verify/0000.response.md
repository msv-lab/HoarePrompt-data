### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( k = 4 - n \% 4 \). This value represents the number of additional copybooks needed to make the total number of copybooks \( n + k \) a multiple of 4. If \( n \% 4 == 0 \), \( k \) is set to 0, meaning no additional copybooks are needed.

2. **Optimal Purchase Strategy**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of \( i \) (number of packs of 3 copybooks) and \( j \) (number of packs of 2 copybooks) to minimize the cost. It ensures that \( 3i + 2j \leq k \).
   - For each combination, the cost is calculated using the formula: \( 3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a \).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost for each valid combination of \( i \) and \( j \) and keeps track of the minimum cost.
   - The cost is computed considering the cost of buying packs of 3, 2, and individual copybooks.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case when \( n \% 4 == 4 \), setting \( k \) to 0, meaning no additional copybooks are needed.
   - It also handles other edge cases appropriately:
     - When \( n \% 4 == 1 \), buying one pack of 3 and one individual copybook is the cheapest option.
     - When \( n \% 4 == 2 \), buying one pack of 2 is the cheapest option.
     - When \( n \% 4 == 3 \), buying one pack of 3 is the cheapest option.

The provided program logic is sound and covers all necessary scenarios. The annotated code aligns with the intended functionality, and the program correctly computes the minimum cost for Alyona to have a multiple of 4 copybooks.
