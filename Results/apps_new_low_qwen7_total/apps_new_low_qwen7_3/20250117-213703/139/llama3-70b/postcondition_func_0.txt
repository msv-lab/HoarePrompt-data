The function processes four non-negative integers \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\)) internally. It calculates the remainder \(k\) of \(n\) divided by 4, setting \(k\) to 0 if it equals 4. Then, it iterates over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\) to find the minimum value of the expression \(3i \cdot c + j \cdot b + (k - 3i - 2j) \cdot a\), where \(3i + 2j \leq k\). Finally, it prints the minimum value found. Potential edge cases include when \(n \% 4 = 4\), in which case \(k\) is set to 0. The function does not return any value directly but modifies and uses the internal variables \(n\), \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(k\) to compute and print the result.
