Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `k = 4 - n \% 4` must be at least 1, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is an integer, `j` is \((4 - n \% 4 - 3 * i) // 2\). The condition \(3 * i + 2 * j \leq k\) is satisfied.***
