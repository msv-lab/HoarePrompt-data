The code `j = (k - 3 * i) // 2` assigns the value of `(k - 3 * i) // 2` to `j`. The variables `k` and `i` are already defined, and `j` is being assigned a new value based on these.

From the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\).
- `k = 4 - n \% 4` must be at least 1, i.e., \(n \% 4 \neq 0\).
- `ans` is positive infinity.

After executing the code:
- `j` is assigned the value of \((k - 3 * i) // 2\).

Since `k` and `i` are known and `k` is calculated as \(4 - n \% 4\), we can express `j` in terms of `n` and `i`.

Let's break it down:
- `k` is \(4 - n \% 4\).
- Therefore, `j` is \((4 - n \% 4 - 3 * i) // 2\).

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Only `j` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `k = 4 - n \% 4` must be at least 1, `ans` is positive infinity, `j` is \((4 - n \% 4 - 3 * i) // 2**.
