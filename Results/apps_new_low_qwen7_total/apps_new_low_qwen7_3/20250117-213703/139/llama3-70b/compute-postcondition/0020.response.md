The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, the function should internally handle non-negative integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

Given the output cases are not specified directly within the function definition but inferred from the problem context, we need to consider the typical structure of such problems.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters as per the given code snippet.
2. The constraints indicate that internal processing might involve the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these are not provided as arguments to the function.
3. Since no return values or output cases are specified within the function body, we infer the function's behavior based on the typical problem context.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters, but processes non-negative integers n, a, b, and c (where 1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 10^9) internally and returns a result based on these values.**
