`ans` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which is positive infinity. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `k` equals 4 - n % 4 (with k set to 0 if k equals 4), `ans` is positive infinity**
