Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `k` equals 4 - n % 4. If `k` equals 4, then `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.***
