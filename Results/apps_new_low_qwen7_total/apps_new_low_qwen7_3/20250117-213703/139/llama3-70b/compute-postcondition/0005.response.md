Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\).
   - `k` equals \(4 - n \% 4\) (with \(k = 0\) if \(k = 4\)).
   - `ans` is positive infinity.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs for `i` in `range(k // 3 + 1)`.

3. **Determine `k`**:
   - Since \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(n \% 4\) can take values from 0 to 3.
   - Therefore, \(k = 4 - (n \% 4)\) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - If \(n \% 4 = 0\), then \(k = 4 - 0 = 4\). In this case, \(k // 3 + 1 = 4 // 3 + 1 = 2\).
   - If \(n \% 4 = 1\), then \(k = 4 - 1 = 3\). In this case, \(k // 3 + 1 = 3 // 3 + 1 = 2\).
   - If \(n \% 4 = 2\), then \(k = 4 - 2 = 2\). In this case, \(k // 3 + 1 = 2 // 3 + 1 = 1\).
   - If \(n \% 4 = 3\), then \(k = 4 - 3 = 1\). In this case, \(k // 3 + 1 = 1 // 3 + 1 = 1\).

4. **First Iteration**:
   For the loop to execute the first time, `k // 3 + 1` must be greater than 0. This means:
   - \(k \geq 1\).

5. **Conditions on `k`**:
   - From the previous steps, we know that \(k\) can be 1, 2, or 3 depending on \(n \% 4\).
   - Therefore, \(k // 3 + 1 > 0\) will always be true if \(k \geq 1\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only condition that directly affects whether the loop will execute the first time is \(k \geq 1\).
   - Given \(k = 4 - n \% 4\), \(k \geq 1\) means \(n \% 4 \neq 0\).

7. **Final State Before Loop Execution**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\).
   - `k = 4 - n \% 4` must be at least 1, i.e., \(n \% 4 \neq 0\).
   - `ans` is positive infinity.

Therefore, the final state before the loop execution should be:

**State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `k = 4 - n \% 4` must be at least 1, `ans` is positive infinity**.
