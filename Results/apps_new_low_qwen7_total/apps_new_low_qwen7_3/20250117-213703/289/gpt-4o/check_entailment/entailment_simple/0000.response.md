### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The tournament follows a knockout format.
   - Players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have played is at most 1.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - In a binary tree structure (which is implied by the knockout format), each level represents a round.
   - The winner needs to progress through multiple rounds, and the maximum number of rounds (or games) they can play is determined by the height of the binary tree formed by the participants.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:**
   - For `n` players, the number of games the winner can play is related to the number of rounds in a balanced binary tree.
   - This is equivalent to finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, which is represented by `n.bit_length() - 1`.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly converts the input `n` to an integer.
   - It then calculates `max_games` using `n.bit_length() - 1`.
   - The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, minus 1 gives the number of levels (or rounds) in the binary tree.

5. **Validation with Examples:**
   - For `n = 2`: The binary tree has only one level (1 game), so the output is `1`.
   - For `n = 3`: The binary tree can have up to 2 levels (2 games), so the output is `2`.
   - For `n = 4`: The binary tree can have up to 2 levels (2 games), so the output is `2`.
   - For `n = 10`: The binary tree can have up to 4 levels (4 games), so the output is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly computes the maximum number of games the winner can play based on the provided constraints and examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
