Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the maximum number of games a tournament winner can play under specific constraints.
2. The key constraint is that two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they have played is at most 1.
3. To maximize the number of games the winner can play, we need to consider how the tournament can be structured while adhering to the given constraint.
4. The provided solution uses `n.bit_length() - 1` to calculate the maximum number of games. This is derived from the fact that in a balanced binary tree (which models the tournament structure), the height (or depth) of the tree determines the maximum number of games a player can play.
5. For `n` players, the maximum depth of the tournament tree (and thus the maximum number of games the winner can play) is given by the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, which can be found using `bit_length()`.

Let's verify the correctness:

- For `n = 2`: The tournament has 1 game, so the winner plays 1 game.
- For `n = 3`: The winner can play up to 2 games. Possible sequence: (1 vs 2), (1 vs 3).
- For `n = 4`: The winner can play up to 2 games. Possible sequence: (1 vs 2, 3 vs 4), (1 vs the winner of 3 vs 4).
- For `n = 10`: The winner can play up to 4 games. Possible sequence: (split into pairs to maintain the balance until the final).

Given these examples, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of games using `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Correctness: **True**
