Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the problem statement together.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of games a winner can play in a knockout tournament where players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most 1.

2. **Key Insight**: In such a tournament, the winner can play at most \( \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1 \) games. This is because each game halves the number of potential opponents until only one remains (the winner).

3. **Given Program Logic**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the user.
   - It computes \( \text{max\_games} = n.\text{bit\_length}() - 1 \).
   - It prints the computed value.

4. **Explanation of Logic**:
   - The method `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent \( n \) in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. For example, for \( n = 8 \), `8.bit_length()` returns 4.
   - Subtracting 1 gives \( \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor \), which is the correct number of games the winner can play.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the problem requirements and examples provided in the problem statement.
   - The program works for all valid inputs within the given range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
