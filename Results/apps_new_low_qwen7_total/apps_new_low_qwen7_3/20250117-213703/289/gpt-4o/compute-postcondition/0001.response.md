The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are provided. However, given the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), it implies that the function might internally use such a value `n` to determine its output.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on internal logic involving an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).**
