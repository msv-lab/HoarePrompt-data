Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

Code Block:
```
n = int(input())
max_games = n.bit_length() - 1
print(max_games)
```

Analysis:
1. The first line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to `n`.
2. The second line calculates the bit length of `n` using `n.bit_length()` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to `max_games`.
3. The third line prints `max_games`.

Since the initial state of `n` is given as a positive integer between \(2\) and \(10^{18}\), let's assume a specific value for `n` to demonstrate the calculation. For example, if `n` is \(12\):

- The bit length of \(12\) (which is \(1100_2\)) is \(4\).
- Subtracting 1 from \(4\) gives \(3\).

Therefore, `max_games` will be \(3\), and this value will be printed.

Final Output State:
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), max_games is 3**
