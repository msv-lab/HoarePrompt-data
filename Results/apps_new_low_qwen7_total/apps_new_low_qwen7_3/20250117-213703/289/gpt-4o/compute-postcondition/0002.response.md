Functionality: **The function takes no explicit input parameters and reads an integer `n` from the user where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It then calculates the maximum number of games that can be played based on the bit length of `n`, subtracting 1 from it. Finally, it prints the result. There are no return values; the output is printed directly to the console. This function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases beyond the specified range.**
