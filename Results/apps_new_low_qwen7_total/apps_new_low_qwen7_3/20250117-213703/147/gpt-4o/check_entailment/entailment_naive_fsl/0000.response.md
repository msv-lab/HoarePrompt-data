Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical issue in the `func_1` function. Specifically, it incorrectly sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` instead of maintaining the original type (either `1` or `-1`) for the tabs that are not closed. This leads to incorrect counts of `e` (tabs with test information) and `s` (social network tabs).

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 2
1 -1 1 -1 1 -1
```

- If `b = 0`, the function should remove tabs at positions `0`, `2`, `4`, but it incorrectly changes all to `0`.
- If `b = 1`, the function should remove tabs at positions `1`, `3`, `5`, but again, it incorrectly changes all to `0`.

This results in all tabs being counted as `0`, leading to incorrect `e` and `s` values.

To fix this, the function should only set `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` if it is within the valid range `[0, n-1]`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0

for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = [t for t in tab_types]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b-1, -1, -k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))

print(max_diff)
```

This corrected version ensures that only the tabs to be closed are marked as `0`, preserving the original types of the remaining tabs.
