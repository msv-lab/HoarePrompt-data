# Problem:
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

# Annotated Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0
for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = func_1(b)
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
print(max_diff)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The first line of input contains n integers, each of which is either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network tabs).
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` must be greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs` is a list of length `n` where `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy `i = b + ik % n` (where `%` denotes the modulo operation), and all other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` in steps of size `k`.
    #   - For each index `i` that satisfies `i = b + ik % n`, the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` is set to `0`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` changes based on the indices `i` computed in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each `i` calculated as `b + ik % n` until `i` no longer falls within the range `[b, n-1]`.
    #   - If `i` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions for the loop to execute are met if `n > b` and `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
    #   - After the loop completes, `remaining_tabs` will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state reflects that all specified elements in `remaining_tabs` have been set to `0` according to the loop's behavior.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy \(i = b + ik \% n\) for any integer \(i\) such that \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n-b}{k} \right\rfloor\). All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs' is the same as `tab_types` except for elements where `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`, which are set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and modifies the list `tab_types` by setting specific elements to `0`. Specifically, it sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`. The function then returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list. 

After the function concludes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`. All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The function ensures that the final state of `remaining_tabs` meets the given postconditions, even in edge cases such as when `k` divides `n-b` exactly or when `b` is very close to `n`.

The function does not modify `n` or `k` and leaves `b` unchanged. It also handles the case where the loop might not execute if `b + ik % n` exceeds `n-1` before completing the iteration.
