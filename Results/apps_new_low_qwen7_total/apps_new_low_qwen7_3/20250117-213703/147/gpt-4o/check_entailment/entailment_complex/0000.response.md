Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(b)` correctly implements the logic to set elements of `remaining_tabs` to `0` based on the given formula `i = b + ik % n`.
   - The function iterates twice over the indices of `remaining_tabs`:
     - The first loop starts from `b` and increments by `k` until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
     - The second loop starts from `b` and decrements by `-k` until `i` is less than `0`.
   - These loops ensure that all indices `i` satisfying `i = b + ik % n` are set to `0`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over all possible choices for `b` from `0` to `n-1` and calculates the remaining tabs after closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`.
   - It then counts the number of `1`s (test information tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in the modified `remaining_tabs` list.
   - The maximum absolute difference between the counts of `1`s and `-1`s is stored in `max_diff` and printed at the end.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b + ik % n` might not cover all elements due to modulo operations and range constraints.
   - The logic accounts for all possible configurations of `tab_types` and correctly computes the required differences.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1(b)` correctly modifies `remaining_tabs` based on the given conditions.
   - The main program correctly computes and updates `max_diff` for all possible choices of `b`.
   - The final output is the maximum absolute difference between the counts of test information tabs and social network tabs after closing the specified tabs.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
