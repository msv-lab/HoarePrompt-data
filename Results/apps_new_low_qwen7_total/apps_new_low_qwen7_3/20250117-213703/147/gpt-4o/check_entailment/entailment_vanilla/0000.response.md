Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly implements the logic to simulate the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from a chosen tab \(b\).
2. The `func_1(b)` function correctly updates the `remaining_tabs` list by setting the value to 0 for the tabs that are closed.
3. The main loop iterates over all possible choices for \(b\) (each tab), and for each choice, it calculates the counts of remaining test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`).
4. It then updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s`.
5. The final output is the maximum absolute difference calculated.

Given that the code follows the problem description accurately and correctly implements the logic, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
