Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the logic correctly based on the problem description. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \) and \( k \), and the list of tab types.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function simulates the process of closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from index \( b \). It iterates through the list and sets the appropriate elements to 0, ensuring that the indices affected by the operation are correctly identified.
3. **Difference Calculation**: For each possible starting index \( b \) (ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \)), the function `func_1` is called to get the remaining tabs after closing the specified tabs. Then, it counts the number of remaining test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`), and calculates the absolute difference \( |e - s| \).
4. **Max Difference Update**: The maximum absolute difference found during these iterations is stored in `max_diff`.
5. **Output**: Finally, the maximum absolute difference is printed.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from a chosen index \( b \). The main loop of the program iterates over all possible starting points \( b \) and correctly calculates the differences.

Since the program follows the steps outlined in the problem description accurately and the logic appears to be sound, the program should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
