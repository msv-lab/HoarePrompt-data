### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description:
Roman needs to close every \( k \)-th tab starting from a chosen tab \( b \), and then determine the maximum absolute difference between the number of tabs containing test information and the number of tabs containing social network information.

#### Given Program:
The program iterates over all possible starting points \( b \) and calls the function `func_1(b)` to generate a list of remaining tabs. It then counts the number of test information tabs (`1`s) and social network tabs (`-1`s) and updates the maximum absolute difference.

#### Function `func_1(b)`:
The function correctly identifies the indices to be closed using the formula `i = b + ik % n`. However, it sets these indices to `0` in `remaining_tabs`, which is incorrect because it should preserve the original type (either `1` or `-1`).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial State**: Valid inputs are provided.
- **Loop in `func_1(b)`**:
  - The first loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for `i = b + ik % n` where `0 <= i < n`.
  - The second loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for `i = b - k + ik % n` where `0 <= i < n`.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment correctly identified the logical issue in the `func_1` function. The current implementation incorrectly sets all elements to `0` instead of maintaining the original types. The correct approach is to only set `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` if it is within the valid range `[0, n-1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0

for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = [t for t in tab_types]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b-1, -1, -k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))

print(max_diff)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately identified the issue in the provided program. The corrected version maintains the original types of the tabs that are not closed, ensuring the correct counts of test information tabs (`1`s) and social network tabs (`-1`s).

**Final: True**
