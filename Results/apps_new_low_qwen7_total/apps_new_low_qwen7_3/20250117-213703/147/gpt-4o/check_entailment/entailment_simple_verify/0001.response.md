### Reasoning:

1. **Correct Implementation of Tab Closure Logic**:
   - The `func_1(b)` function correctly simulates the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from a chosen tab \(b\). This is evident from the loops that iterate through indices starting from `b` and decrementing by `k`, setting the corresponding elements in `remaining_tabs` to `0`.

2. **Main Loop Execution**:
   - The main loop iterates over all possible choices for \(b\) (each tab from \(0\) to \(n-1\)). For each choice of \(b\), it calls `func_1(b)` to update `remaining_tabs` and then counts the remaining tabs of each type (`e` and `s`).
   - The loop updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between the counts of remaining test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`).

3. **Correct Counting and Updating of Differences**:
   - The `count()` method is used to count the remaining tabs of each type in `remaining_tabs`.
   - The absolute difference `abs(e - s)` is calculated for each iteration and compared with the current `max_diff`, updating `max_diff` if the new difference is larger.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all edge cases correctly. For instance, when `b = 0`, the first loop in `func_1(b)` will start from `b` and go up to `n-1` in steps of `k`. Similarly, the second loop will start from `b` and go down to `-1` in steps of `-k`, ensuring all relevant indices are covered.

5. **Annotations Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, including the initial state, the state after each loop execution, and the final state. These annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected and adheres to the problem description.

Given that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the main loop and helper function work as intended, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
