### Reasoning

1. **Function `func_1(b)` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(b)` is designed to simulate the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from tab \(b\).
   - However, the function summary provided in the assessment seems to describe a different behavior than what the function actually does. The actual function sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`. This means it only closes tabs in one direction (forward and backward) but not all tabs congruent to `b` modulo `k`.
   - This discrepancy means that `func_1(b)` does not fully simulate the problem statement's requirement of closing every \(k\)-th tab. For example, if \(k = 3\) and \(b = 8\) with \(n = 14\), the function would close tabs 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14, which is not correct as per the problem description. The function should close tabs 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 as well as 14, 11, 8, 5, and 2 in both directions.

2. **Main Loop and Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over all possible choices for \(b\) (each tab) and for each choice, it calls `func_1(b)` to get the updated list of `remaining_tabs`.
   - It then calculates the counts of remaining test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`).
   - It updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s`.
   - This part of the logic is correct and consistent with the problem description.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - Given the issue with `func_1(b)` not fully simulating the required behavior, the overall logic of finding the maximum absolute difference is flawed. The function `func_1(b)` does not correctly implement the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1(b)` does not correctly simulate the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Final: **False**
