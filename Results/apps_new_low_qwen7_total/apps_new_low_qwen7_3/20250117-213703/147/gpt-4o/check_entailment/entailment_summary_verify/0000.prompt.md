You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0
for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = func_1(b)
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
print(max_diff)

def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    return remaining_tabs



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and modifies the list `tab_types` by setting specific elements to `0`. Specifically, it sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`. The function then returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list. 

After the function concludes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`. All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The function ensures that the final state of `remaining_tabs` meets the given postconditions, even in edge cases such as when `k` divides `n-b` exactly or when `b` is very close to `n`.

The function does not modify `n` or `k` and leaves `b` unchanged. It also handles the case where the loop might not execute if `b + ik % n` exceeds `n-1` before completing the iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical issue in the `func_1` function. Specifically, it incorrectly sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` instead of maintaining the original type (either `1` or `-1`) for the tabs that are not closed. This leads to incorrect counts of `e` (tabs with test information) and `s` (social network tabs).

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 2
1 -1 1 -1 1 -1
```

- If `b = 0`, the function should remove tabs at positions `0`, `2`, `4`, but it incorrectly changes all to `0`.
- If `b = 1`, the function should remove tabs at positions `1`, `3`, `5`, but again, it incorrectly changes all to `0`.

This results in all tabs being counted as `0`, leading to incorrect `e` and `s` values.

To fix this, the function should only set `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` if it is within the valid range `[0, n-1]`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
tab_types = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_diff = 0

for b in range(n):
    remaining_tabs = [t for t in tab_types]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    for i in range(b-1, -1, -k):
        if 0 <= i < n:
            remaining_tabs[i] = 0
    
    e = remaining_tabs.count(1)
    s = remaining_tabs.count(-1)
    max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))

print(max_diff)
```

This corrected version ensures that only the tabs to be closed are marked as `0`, preserving the original types of the remaining tabs.
