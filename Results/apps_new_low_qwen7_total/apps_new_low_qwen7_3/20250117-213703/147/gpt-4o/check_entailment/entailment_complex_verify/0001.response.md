### Reasoning:

1. **Correct Implementation of Function `func_1(b)`**:
   - The function `func_1(b)` correctly simulates the process of closing every \(k\)-th tab starting from tab \(b\). This is achieved by iterating over indices from `b` to `n-1` in steps of `k` and setting `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for these indices. Similarly, it iterates from `b` to `-1` in steps of `-k` to ensure all indices that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` are set to `0`.
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly updates the `remaining_tabs` list according to the specified rules and does not modify `n`, `k`, or `b` beyond their initial values.

2. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over all possible choices for `b` (from `0` to `n-1`). For each `b`, it calls `func_1(b)` to get the `remaining_tabs` list after closing the relevant tabs.
   - It then calculates the counts of remaining test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) using `remaining_tabs.count(1)` and `remaining_tabs.count(-1)` respectively.
   - The loop updates `max_diff` with the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s` for each `b`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum absolute difference calculated, which is the desired output.

Given the detailed annotations and the step-by-step analysis, the provided code indeed implements the logic correctly and accurately follows the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct.

**Final: True**
