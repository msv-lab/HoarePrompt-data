Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Parsing**:
   - The code correctly parses the input to get the number of tabs `n` and the interval `k`.
   - It also correctly reads the types of tabs as integers into the `tab_types` list.

2. **Loop through Each Possible Starting Tab**:
   - The program iterates over each possible starting tab `b` using a for loop. This is correct since `b` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Modifying the `remaining_tabs` List**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for indices `i` that are congruent to `b` modulo `k` using both forward and backward loops. This ensures that all indices `i` satisfying `i = b + ik % n` are set to `0`.

4. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of `1`s (test tabs) and `-1`s (social network tabs) in the modified `remaining_tabs` list.
   - It then calculates the absolute difference between these counts and updates `max_diff` if the current difference is larger.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum absolute difference found.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum absolute difference between the number of remaining test information tabs and social network tabs after closing every `k`-th tab starting from each possible tab `b`.

Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
