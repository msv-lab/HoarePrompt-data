#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The first line of input contains n integers, each of which is either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network tabs).
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` must be greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs` is a list of length `n` where `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy `i = b + ik % n` (where `%` denotes the modulo operation), and all other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` in steps of size `k`.
    #   - For each index `i` that satisfies `i = b + ik % n`, the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` is set to `0`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` changes based on the indices `i` computed in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each `i` calculated as `b + ik % n` until `i` no longer falls within the range `[b, n-1]`.
    #   - If `i` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions for the loop to execute are met if `n > b` and `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
    #   - After the loop completes, `remaining_tabs` will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state reflects that all specified elements in `remaining_tabs` have been set to `0` according to the loop's behavior.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy \(i = b + ik \% n\) for any integer \(i\) such that \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n-b}{k} \right\rfloor\). All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs' is the same as `tab_types` except for elements where `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`, which are set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and modifies the list `tab_types` by setting specific elements to `0`. Specifically, it sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`. The function then returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list. 

After the function concludes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`. All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The function ensures that the final state of `remaining_tabs` meets the given postconditions, even in edge cases such as when `k` divides `n-b` exactly or when `b` is very close to `n`.

The function does not modify `n` or `k` and leaves `b` unchanged. It also handles the case where the loop might not execute if `b + ik % n` exceeds `n-1` before completing the iteration.
