Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Loop Header**:
   - The loop header is `for i in range(b, -1, -k):`. This means the loop will iterate from `b` down to `0` in steps of `-k`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` must be greater than `b`: This ensures there are enough indices to start the loop.
   - `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`: This ensures the step size `k` is valid.
   - `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`: This ensures `b` is a valid starting point.

3. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - The loop will start with `i` initialized to `b`.

4. **Condition for First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be at least `b`.
   - Since `i` is initialized to `b`, this condition is inherently satisfied.

5. **Condition for Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The loop will continue to decrement `i` by `-k` until `i` becomes less than `0`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `i` must be initialized to `b`.
   - Given that `i` is initialized to `b`, the condition `i ≥ b` is always true initially.
   - Additionally, since `b` is a valid starting point (`1 ≤ b ≤ n`), the loop can start.

### Final State:

- `n` must be greater than `b`.
- `k` must be an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
- `b` must be an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
- `i` must be initialized to `b`.

Therefore, the state before the loop executes the first time is:

**State: **`n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is initialized to `b`**.
