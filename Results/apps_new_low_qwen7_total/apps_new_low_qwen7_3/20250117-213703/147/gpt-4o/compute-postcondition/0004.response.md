`remaining_tabs[i]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `i` is `b + k`, where `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`. The value of `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`, which remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `b`, `i` is `b + k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`; `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`, `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`**
