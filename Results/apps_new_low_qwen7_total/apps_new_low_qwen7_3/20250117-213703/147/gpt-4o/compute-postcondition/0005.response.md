Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` must be greater than `b`.
   - `i` is `b + k`.
   - `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
   - `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`.
   - `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(b, n, k)`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `[b, n)` with a step size of `k`.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `b + k`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `k` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `(b + k) + k = b + 2k`.

6. **Adjusted States**:
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `i` will now be `b + 2k`.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` and `remaining_tabs[i]` remain `0` because they are not modified within the loop.

7. **Final State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `[b, n)` with a step size of `k`.
   - After the adjustment, `i` is `b + 2k`, so `b + 2k` must still be within the range `[b, n)`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` must be greater than `b`, `i` is `b + 2k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`, `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`**.
