Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`, `b`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. The loop increments `i` by `k` in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than `b`.
   - `i` is `b`.
   - `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
   - `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `b` and increments by `k` each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `b + k`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `b + k < n` must hold true.
   - `b` and `k` remain the same as they are not updated within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0` and does not change unless the loop body modifies it, which is not indicated here.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` becomes `b + k`.
   - `n` remains greater than `b`.
   - `k` remains an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
   - `b` remains an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` remains `0`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `b`, `i` is `b + k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, and `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`; `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`**
