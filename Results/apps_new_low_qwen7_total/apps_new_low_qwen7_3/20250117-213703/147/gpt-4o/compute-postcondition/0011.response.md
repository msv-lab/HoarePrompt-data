The given code snippet updates the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0`. From the initial state, we know that:

- `n` is greater than `b`.
- `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
- `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
- `i` is `b - k`.
- `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`.

The code snippet `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` sets the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0`. Since `i` is `b - k`, this means `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is set to `0`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is `b - k`, `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is `0`**
