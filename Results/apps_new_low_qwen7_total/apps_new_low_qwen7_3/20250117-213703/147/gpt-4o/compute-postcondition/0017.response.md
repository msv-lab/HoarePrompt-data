Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `b` and modifies the list `tab_types` by setting specific elements to `0`. Specifically, it sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy the condition `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`. The function then returns the modified `remaining_tabs` list. 

After the function concludes, the `remaining_tabs` list will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`. All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The function ensures that the final state of `remaining_tabs` meets the given postconditions, even in edge cases such as when `k` divides `n-b` exactly or when `b` is very close to `n`.

The function does not modify `n` or `k` and leaves `b` unchanged. It also handles the case where the loop might not execute if `b + ik % n` exceeds `n-1` before completing the iteration.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function, including its input parameters, the actions it performs, and the final state of the program after it concludes, while also addressing potential edge cases and missing logic in the annotations.
