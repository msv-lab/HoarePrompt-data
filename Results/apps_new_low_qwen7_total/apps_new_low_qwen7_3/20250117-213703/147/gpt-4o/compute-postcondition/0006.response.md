The line of code `remaining_tabs[i] = 0` sets the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` to 0. Since `i` is defined as `b + 2k`, the value of `remaining_tabs[i]` is now explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `k`, and `remaining_tabs[b]`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `b`, `i` is `b + 2k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`, `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0`**
