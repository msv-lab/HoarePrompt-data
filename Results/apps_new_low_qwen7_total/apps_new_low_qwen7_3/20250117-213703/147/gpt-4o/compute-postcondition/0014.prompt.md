Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` must be greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs` is a list of length `n` where `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy `i = b + ik % n` (where `%` denotes the modulo operation), and all other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` in steps of size `k`.
   - For each index `i` that satisfies `i = b + ik % n`, the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` is set to `0`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
   - `b` remains constant.
   - `remaining_tabs` changes based on the indices `i` computed in the loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each `i` calculated as `b + ik % n` until `i` no longer falls within the range `[b, n-1]`.
   - If `i` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions for the loop to execute are met if `n > b` and `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
   - After the loop completes, `remaining_tabs` will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`.

Thus, the final output state reflects that all specified elements in `remaining_tabs` have been set to `0` according to the loop's behavior.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(b, -1, -k):
    remaining_tabs[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is initialized to `b`, `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is `b - k`, `remaining_tabs[b - k]` is `0`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `i` is \(b - 2k\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
