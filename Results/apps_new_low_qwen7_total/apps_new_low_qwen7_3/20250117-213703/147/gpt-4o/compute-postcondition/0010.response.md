Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The range function parameters are `b`, `-1`, and `-k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `b` down to `-1` in steps of `-k`.

3. **Determine the current state:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than `b`.
   - `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`.
   - `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
   - `i` is initialized to `b`.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to `b`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by `k` until `i` reaches or goes below `-1`.

5. **Determine the next state:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by `k`, the new value of `i` will be `i - k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i - k` must still be greater than or equal to `-1`.

6. **Update the states:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i - k`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` remains `0` as it is not part of the loop head.

7. **Formulate the new state:**
   - Since `i` is decremented by `k`, the new value of `i` will be `b - k`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `b`.
   - `k` and `b` remain within their respective ranges.
   - `remaining_tabs[b]` remains `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is `b - k`, `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`**
