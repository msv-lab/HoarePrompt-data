The code sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to 0. The value of `i` is determined by the formula `b - 2k`. Since `i` is already calculated in the initial state as `b - 2k` and it is given that `b - 2k \geq -1`, the value of `i` remains the same. The state of the other variables (`n`, `b`, `k`) is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `i` is \(b - 2k\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is 0.**
