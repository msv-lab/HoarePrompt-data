Output State: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy \(i = b + ik \% n\) for any integer \(i\) such that \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n-b}{k} \right\rfloor\). All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
