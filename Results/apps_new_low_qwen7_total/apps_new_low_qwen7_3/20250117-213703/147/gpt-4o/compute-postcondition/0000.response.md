The code `remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]` creates a copy of the list `tab_types` and assigns it to the variable `remaining_tabs`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n; `tab_types` is a list of n integers, each of which is either 1 or -1; `remaining_tabs` is a copy of `tab_types`.**
