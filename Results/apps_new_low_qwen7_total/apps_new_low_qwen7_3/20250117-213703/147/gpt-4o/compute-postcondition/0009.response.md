`remaining_tabs[i]` is assigned the value `0`. The index `i` is set to the value of `b`, which means `remaining_tabs[b]` is now `0`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `i` is initialized to `b`, `remaining_tabs[b]` is `0`**
