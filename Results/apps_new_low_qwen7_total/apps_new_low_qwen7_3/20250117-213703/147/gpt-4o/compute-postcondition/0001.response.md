Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Control Variables**: The loop control variables in the given `for` loop are `i`, `b`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Understand the Range of the Loop**: The loop starts from `b` and goes up to `n` with a step size of `k`. Therefore, the first value of `i` will be `b`, and subsequent values will be `b + k, b + 2k, ...` until the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied.

3. **Initial Values**: We know the initial values of `n` and `k` such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, and `b` is such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.

4. **Condition for First Iteration**: For the loop to execute at least once, the initial value of `i` (which is `b`) should be less than `n`. This ensures that there is at least one iteration of the loop where `i` starts from `b` and increments by `k`.

5. **State of Other Variables**: The other variables like `tab_types` and `remaining_tabs` do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given conditions. However, they maintain their original values within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the state of the loop head for the loop to execute the first time must satisfy the following conditions:
- `b` should be less than `n` to ensure the loop can start.
- `i` should be initialized to `b` (the starting point of the range).

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`n` must be greater than `b`, `i` is `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, and `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`**
