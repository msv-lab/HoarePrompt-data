You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The first line of input contains n integers, each of which is either 1 or -1, representing the type of each tab (1 for test information, -1 for social network tabs).
def func_1(b):
    remaining_tabs = tab_types[:]
    for i in range(b, n, k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` must be greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, `remaining_tabs` is a list of length `n` where `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy `i = b + ik % n` (where `%` denotes the modulo operation), and all other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
    #   - The loop iterates over indices starting from `b` up to `n-1` in steps of size `k`.
    #   - For each index `i` that satisfies `i = b + ik % n`, the corresponding element in `remaining_tabs` is set to `0`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `n` and `k` remain constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `b` remains constant.
    #   - `remaining_tabs` changes based on the indices `i` computed in the loop.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop sets `remaining_tabs[i]` to `0` for each `i` calculated as `b + ik % n` until `i` no longer falls within the range `[b, n-1]`.
    #   - If `i` exceeds `n-1`, the loop terminates.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The conditions for the loop to execute are met if `n > b` and `2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
    #   - After the loop completes, `remaining_tabs` will have `0` at indices that are congruent to `b` modulo `k`, i.e., `i = b + ik % n` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state reflects that all specified elements in `remaining_tabs` have been set to `0` according to the loop's behavior.
    for i in range(b, -1, -k):
        remaining_tabs[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is greater than `b`, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k < n \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq n\), `remaining_tabs[i]` is `0` for all indices `i` that satisfy \(i = b + ik \% n\) for any integer \(i\) such that \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n-b}{k} \right\rfloor\). All other elements in `remaining_tabs` remain equal to their initial values in `tab_types`. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `n-1`.
    return remaining_tabs
    #`remaining_tabs' is the same as `tab_types` except for elements where `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`, which are set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, and modifies the list `tab_types` by setting specific elements to `0`.

```

Return Postconditions: `remaining_tabs' is the same as `tab_types` except for elements where `i = b + ik % n` for any integer `i` such that `0 <= i <= floor((n-b)/k)`, which are set to `0`. All other elements remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
