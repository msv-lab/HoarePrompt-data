You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100, and a list of integers of length n where each integer is either 1 or -1.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))

max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        e, s = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 6, k is 3, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 2, b is > 6.
    print(max_diff)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible starting points `b` (from 1 to `n`) and calculating the number of remaining test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) after removing every `k`-th tab.
2. The logic inside the program iterates over all tabs and updates the counts of remaining test and social network tabs based on whether the current tab should be removed or not. This is done correctly using the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
3. The program calculates the absolute difference between the counts of remaining test and social network tabs for each possible starting point and keeps track of the maximum difference found.
4. The output is the maximum absolute difference found, which is printed at the end.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs for any given `k`.

Correctness: **True**
