### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description.

#### Given Code:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function accepts a list of integers `tabs` of length `n` where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100. It calculates the maximum difference between the count of 1s and -1s in any subarray of `tabs` with a sliding window size of `b` that is a multiple of `k`. The function then prints this maximum difference.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Problem Description**:
   - Roman needs to close every `k`-th tab starting from a chosen tab `b`.
   - After closing the tabs, he wants to maximize the absolute difference between the number of test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`).

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each possible `b` from 1 to `n`.
   - The inner loop iterates over each tab index `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is used to determine if the tab should be kept open.
     - This condition is indeed correct because it checks if the tab at index `i` is **not** the one that would be closed starting from `b`.

3. **Summary Reconciliation**:
   - The summary states that the function calculates the maximum difference between the count of 1s and -1s in any subarray of `tabs` with a sliding window size of `b` that is a multiple of `k`.
   - The summary correctly describes the logic of the program, as the current implementation correctly identifies which tabs are closed and which are left open.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation accurately reflects the problem description and the desired behavior.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is indeed the correct way to ensure that the tab at position `i` is kept open when starting from `b`.

Given this analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
