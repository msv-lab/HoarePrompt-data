You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This morning, Roman woke up and opened the browser with $n$ opened tabs numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two kinds of tabs: those with the information required for the test and those with social network sites. Roman decided that there are too many tabs open so he wants to close some of them.

He decided to accomplish this by closing every $k$-th ($2 \leq k \leq n - 1$) tab. Only then he will decide whether he wants to study for the test or to chat on the social networks. Formally, Roman will choose one tab (let its number be $b$) and then close all tabs with numbers $c = b + i \cdot k$ that satisfy the following condition: $1 \leq c \leq n$ and $i$ is an integer (it may be positive, negative or zero).

For example, if $k = 3$, $n = 14$ and Roman chooses $b = 8$, then he will close tabs with numbers $2$, $5$, $8$, $11$ and $14$.

After closing the tabs Roman will calculate the amount of remaining tabs with the information for the test (let's denote it $e$) and the amount of remaining social network tabs ($s$). Help Roman to calculate the maximal absolute value of the difference of those values $|e - s|$ so that it would be easy to decide what to do next.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed.

The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
1 1 -1 1

Output
2

Input
14 3
-1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1

Output
9



-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$.

In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = 0
    for b in range(1, n + 1):
        (e, s) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i - b) % k != 0:
                e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
                s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
    print(max_diff)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `tabs` of length `n` where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100. It calculates the maximum difference between the count of 1s and -1s in any subarray of `tabs` with a sliding window size of `b` that is a multiple of `k`. The function then prints this maximum difference.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with how it calculates the tabs to be closed. Specifically, the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is used to determine which tabs to keep open. However, this condition actually means that the tab at position `i` is not the one being closed (`b`), which is the opposite of what is intended. 

The program should be checking if `(i - b) % k == 0` to determine which tabs to close. As a result, the current implementation incorrectly counts the number of tabs of each type that would remain open after closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`. 

To fix this, the inner loop condition should be changed to:

```python
if (i - b) % k == 0:
```

With this change, the program would correctly calculate the number of remaining tabs of each type and compute the maximum absolute difference \( |e - s| \).
