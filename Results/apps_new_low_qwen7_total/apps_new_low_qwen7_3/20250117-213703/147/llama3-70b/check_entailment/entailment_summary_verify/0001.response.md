Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum absolute difference between the number of test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) after removing every `k`-th tab starting from each possible tab `b`.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**: The summary states that the function iterates through all possible starting points `b` (from 1 to `n`) and calculates the number of remaining test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) after removing every `k`-th tab. However, the summary incorrectly describes the condition used to determine which tabs to remove as `(i - b) % k != 0`. This condition actually checks which tabs to keep, not which to remove. To remove every `k`-th tab starting from `b`, the condition should be `(i - b) % k == 0`.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible starting points `b` (from 1 to `n`).
   - The inner loop iterates over all tabs from 1 to `n`.
   - The condition `if (i - b) % k != 0:` is used to update the counts of remaining test and social network tabs. This means it is checking which tabs to keep, not which to remove. Therefore, the logic to calculate `e` and `s` is incorrect.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly remove every `k`-th tab starting from `b`, the condition should be `if (i - b) % k == 0:`.
   - This would mean updating `e` and `s` when the tab should be removed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to remove every `k`-th tab. Instead, it uses a condition to check which tabs to keep, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
