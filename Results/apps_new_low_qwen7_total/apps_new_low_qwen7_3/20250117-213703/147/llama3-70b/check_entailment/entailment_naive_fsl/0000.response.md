Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with how it calculates the tabs to be closed. Specifically, the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is used to determine which tabs to keep open. However, this condition actually means that the tab at position `i` is not the one being closed (`b`), which is the opposite of what is intended. 

The program should be checking if `(i - b) % k == 0` to determine which tabs to close. As a result, the current implementation incorrectly counts the number of tabs of each type that would remain open after closing every `k`-th tab starting from `b`. 

To fix this, the inner loop condition should be changed to:

```python
if (i - b) % k == 0:
```

With this change, the program would correctly calculate the number of remaining tabs of each type and compute the maximum absolute difference \( |e - s| \).
