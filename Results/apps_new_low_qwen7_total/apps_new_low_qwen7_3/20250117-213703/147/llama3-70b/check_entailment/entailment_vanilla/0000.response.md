Reasoning:
1. The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible starting points `b` (from 1 to `n`) and calculating the number of remaining test tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) after removing every `k`-th tab.
2. The logic inside the program iterates over all tabs and updates the counts of remaining test and social network tabs based on whether the current tab should be removed or not. This is done correctly using the condition `(i - b) % k != 0`.
3. The program calculates the absolute difference between the counts of remaining test and social network tabs for each possible starting point and keeps track of the maximum difference found.
4. The output is the maximum absolute difference found, which is printed at the end.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum absolute difference between the remaining test and social network tabs for any given `k`.

Correctness: **True**
