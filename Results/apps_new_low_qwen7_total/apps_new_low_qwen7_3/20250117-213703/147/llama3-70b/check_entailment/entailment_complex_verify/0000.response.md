### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to verify the original assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to maximize the absolute difference \( |e - s| \) where \( e \) is the count of test information tabs and \( s \) is the count of social network tabs left after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from tab \( b \).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code iterates over each possible tab \( b \) (from 1 to \( n \)).
   - For each \( b \), it initializes counters \( e \) and \( s \) to 0.
   - The inner loop iterates over each tab \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
     - If \( (i - b) \% k \neq 0 \), it increments the appropriate counter \( e \) or \( s \) depending on the tab type.
     - This condition is supposed to check which tabs are not closed, but it does not align with the problem's requirement.

3. **Issue with the Current Implementation:**
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` checks if the tab at position \( i \) is not the one being closed. This is incorrect because it means the tab is kept open, which is the opposite of what we want.
   - To correctly implement the logic, we need to check if `(i - b) % k == 0` to identify which tabs are closed.

4. **Corrected Logic:**
   - The corrected condition should be `(i - b) % k == 0` inside the inner loop to correctly identify the tabs to be closed.
   - The corrected code would increment the counters \( e \) and \( s \) when the condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is true, meaning the tab is not closed.

5. **Corrected Code:**
   ```python
   def func():
       (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
       tabs = list(map(int, input().split()))
       max_diff = 0
       for b in range(1, n + 1):
           e, s = 0, 0
           for i in range(1, n + 1):
               if (i - b) % k != 0:
                   if tabs[i - 1] == 1:
                       e += 1
                   elif tabs[i - 1] == -1:
                       s += 1
           max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))
       print(max_diff)
   ```

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is accurate. The current implementation incorrectly counts the tabs to be kept open. By changing the condition to `(i - b) % k == 0`, the program would correctly identify the tabs to be closed and compute the maximum absolute difference \( |e - s| \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program needs to be fixed as described to correctly solve the problem.
