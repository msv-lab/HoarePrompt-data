Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func()` which takes no arguments but reads input inside the function, as specified in the problem statement.
2. The variables `n` and `k` are correctly read from the first line of input, and the list `tabs` is correctly read from the second line of input.
3. The loop over `b` iterates through all possible starting points for the sequence of tabs to be removed, which matches the problem's requirement.
4. Inside the loop, the counters `e` and `s` are initialized to 0, and they are incremented based on the values in the `tabs` list, excluding the tabs that would be closed (i.e., those that are multiples of `k` shifted by `b`).
5. The `max_diff` variable is updated correctly to store the maximum absolute difference between `e` and `s` found during the iterations.
6. The program prints the final result, which is the value of `max_diff`.

Given that the annotated program closely follows the logic described in the problem statement and the steps outlined in the reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
