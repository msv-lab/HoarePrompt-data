Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible starting points \( b \) (from 1 to \( n \)) for the tabs to be closed.
2. For each \( b \), it counts the number of test information tabs (`e`) and social network tabs (`s`) that remain after closing every \( k \)-th tab starting from \( b \).
3. It then calculates the absolute difference \( |e - s| \) and updates the maximum difference found so far.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints and logic as described in the problem statement.

Given the execution summary, the program's logic aligns with the problem requirements. The program iterates over all possible starting points for the tabs to be closed, calculates the remaining tabs' types, and finds the maximum absolute difference between the counts of these types. 

Therefore, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
