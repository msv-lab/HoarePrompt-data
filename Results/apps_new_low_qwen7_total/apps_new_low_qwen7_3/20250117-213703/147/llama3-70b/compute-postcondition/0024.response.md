Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 6
- `e` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != 1` else 1)
- `s` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != -1` else 1)
- `b` has any value
- `k` has any value

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

### Current Value of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

### Loop Execution:
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` will be 3.

### Conditions for Loop Continuation:
- The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
- Given `n` is 6, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to 6.

### Adjusting States:
- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- `n` remains the same.
- `e` and `s` do not change based on the loop conditions.

### Final State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is 6
- `e` remains as 0 (if `tabs[1] != 1` else 1)
- `s` remains as 0 (if `tabs[1] != -1` else 1)
- `b` has any value
- `k` has any value

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 6, `e` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != 1` else 1), `s` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != -1` else 1), `b` has any value, `k` has any value**
