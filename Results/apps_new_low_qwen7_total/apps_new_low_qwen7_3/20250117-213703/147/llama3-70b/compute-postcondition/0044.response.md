The code `print(max_diff)` simply prints the value of `max_diff`, which is already defined in the initial state. No variables are updated or altered by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `k` is 3, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2, `b` is > 6**
