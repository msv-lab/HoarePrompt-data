The code updates `max_diff` to be the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `e` and `s`. Initially, `max_diff` is 0, `e` is 3, and `s` is 1. The absolute difference between `e` and `s` is `abs(3 - 1)`, which is 2. Since 2 is greater than the current `max_diff` (which is 0), `max_diff` is updated to 2.

Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is 6, `k` is 3, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2, `b` is 1, `e` is 3, `s` is 1**
