Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is 6, `e` is 1, `s` is 1, `b` is 2, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2. The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is evaluated, and if true, the state remains unchanged; if false, the state also remains unchanged since there is no else part that modifies the variables.**
