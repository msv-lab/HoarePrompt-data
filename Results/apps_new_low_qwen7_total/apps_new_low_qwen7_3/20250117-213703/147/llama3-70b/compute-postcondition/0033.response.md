Output State: **i is 1, n is 6, e is 1, s is 0, b is 2, k has any value, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 2**

Explanation:
- The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[0]`) is equal to 1. Since `tabs[0]` is 1, the condition evaluates to true, and `e` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `e` becomes 1.
- The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[0]`) is equal to -1. Since `tabs[0]` is 1, the condition evaluates to false, and `s` remains unchanged at 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `b`, `k`, `tabs`, and `max_diff`) are not affected by the given code snippet.
- The precondition `(i - b) % k is not equal to 0` remains valid since `i` is 1 and `b` is 2, which means `(1 - 2) % k` (or `-1 % k`) is not equal to 0, regardless of the value of `k`.
