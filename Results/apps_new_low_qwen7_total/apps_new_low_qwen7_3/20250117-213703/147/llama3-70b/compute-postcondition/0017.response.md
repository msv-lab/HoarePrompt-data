Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is initially 7.
   - `n` is initially 6.

3. **Condition for the First Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the for loop, which is from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, the first value of `i` should be 1.

4. **Adjust Initial Values**:
   - The initial value of `i` (which is 7) cannot satisfy the condition for the first iteration since it is greater than `n + 1` (which is 7).
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains as 6, because the loop condition depends on `n`, but `i` needs to be adjusted.
   - The other variables (`k`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `b`, `e`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values remain unchanged.

Based on the above reasoning, the state before the first execution of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 6**.
