The code initializes two variables `e` and `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `k` is 3, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 0, `b` is 1, `e` is 0, `s` is 0**
