The code `e, s = 0, 0` assigns the value `0` to both `e` and `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are `e` is 0 and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2**
