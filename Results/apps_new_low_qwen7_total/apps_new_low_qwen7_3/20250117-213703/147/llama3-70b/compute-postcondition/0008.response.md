The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to 1. Given that `i` is 2, we look at `tabs[1]`, which is -1. Therefore, this condition evaluates to `False`, and `e` remains unchanged at 1.

The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to -1. Again, looking at `tabs[1]`, which is -1, this condition evaluates to `True`. Thus, `s` is incremented by 1, making `s` equal to 1 (from 0 initially).

No other variables are affected by these lines of code. 

Output State: **i is 2, n is 6, k is 3, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 0, b is 1, e is 1, s is 1**
