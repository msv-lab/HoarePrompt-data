The initial state is: `i` is 3, `n` is 6, `e` is 1, `s` is 1, `b` is 2, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2.

Let's analyze the code snippet:

```python
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

Here, `i` is 3, so we need to evaluate `tabs[3 - 1]`, which is `tabs[2]`. The value at index 2 of `tabs` is 1. 

For the first line:
- `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[2]`) is 1.
- `tabs[i - 1] == 1` evaluates to `True`.
- Therefore, `e += True` means `e += 1`.

For the second line:
- `tabs[i - 1]` (which is `tabs[2]`) is 1.
- `tabs[i - 1] == -1` evaluates to `False`.
- Therefore, `s += False` means `s += 0`.

After these operations, `e` becomes `1 + 1 = 2` and `s` remains `1`.

No other variables are affected. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code, and `max_diff` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **i is 3, n is 6, e is 2, s is 1, b is 2, k has any value, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 2**
