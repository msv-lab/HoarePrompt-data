The initial state is as follows:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 6
- `e` is 1
- `s` is 0
- `b` is 2
- `k` has any value (unchanged)
- `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1]
- `max_diff` is 2

Let's execute the code block:

```python
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

### First Line: `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`
- `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
- `tabs[1]` is `-1`.
- The expression `tabs[i - 1] == 1` evaluates to `False` (0).
- Therefore, `e` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.

### Second Line: `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`
- `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
- `tabs[1]` is `-1`.
- The expression `tabs[i - 1] == -1` evaluates to `True` (1).
- Therefore, `s` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.

The updated state after executing the code block is:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 6
- `e` is 1 (unchanged to 1)
- `s` is 1
- `b` is 2
- `k` has any value (unchanged)
- `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1]
- `max_diff` is 2

Output State: **i is 2, n is 6, e is 1, s is 1, b is 2, k has any value, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 2**
