Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head specifies `b` as the variable that changes in each iteration. The range of `b` is from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 8
   - `n` is 6
   - `e` is 0
   - `s` is 0
   - `b` has any value (initially 1 since it starts at 1)
   - `k` has any value
   - `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1]
   - `max_diff` is 2

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `n + 1`. Currently, `b` starts at 1, so we need to check if `b` can be incremented to the next value within the range.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `b` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to increment `b` by 1.
   - `b` will now be 2.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is 8, `n` is 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2**
