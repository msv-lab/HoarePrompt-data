The code updates `max_diff` to be the maximum value between its current value (2) and the absolute difference between `e` (2) and `s` (1). The absolute difference between `e` and `s` is `abs(2 - 1)`, which is 1. Since 2 is greater than 1, `max_diff` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 6, `e` is 2, `s` is 1, `b` is 2, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2**
