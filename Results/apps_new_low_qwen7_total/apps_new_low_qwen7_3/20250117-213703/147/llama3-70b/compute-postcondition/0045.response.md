The function `func` accepts a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100. The function returns a specific value based on the conditions provided. However, since the exact condition for the return value is not specified in the given output, we can only describe the parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers of length `n` where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100.
