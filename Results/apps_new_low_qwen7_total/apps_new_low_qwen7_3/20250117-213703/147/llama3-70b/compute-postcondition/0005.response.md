The first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to 1. Given that `i` is 1, it checks `tabs[0]`, which is 1. Since `tabs[0]` is indeed 1, `e` is incremented by 1, making `e` equal to 1 (since `e` was initially 0).

The second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` checks if the element at index `i - 1` in the list `tabs` is equal to -1. Again, since `i` is 1, it checks `tabs[0]`, which is 1. Since `tabs[0]` is not -1, `s` remains unchanged and stays at 0.

After executing both lines, the updated values are:
- `e` is now 1
- `s` remains 0

All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `tabs`, `max_diff`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **i is 1, n is 6, k is 3, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 0, b is 1, e is 1, s is 0**
