The initial state is `i` is 3, `n` is 6. However, there are references to `tabs` which is not defined in the provided initial state or within the code snippet. In Python, attempting to access an element of an undefined list (or array) will result in a `NameError`. Given the context and the lack of definition for `tabs`, it's clear that `tabs` must be defined elsewhere or assumed to exist for the code to run without errors.

Since `tabs` is not defined, we cannot proceed with the given code snippet to determine the exact values of `e` and `s`. Therefore, based on the provided information and the need for `tabs` to be defined, the code cannot be executed as is.

Output State: **i is 3, n is 6, tabs is undefined, e is undefined, s is undefined**
