The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is 6. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since the loop condition `i <= n` must hold true for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

The variable `n` remains unchanged since it is the upper bound of the `range` function and does not change within the loop itself.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 6**
