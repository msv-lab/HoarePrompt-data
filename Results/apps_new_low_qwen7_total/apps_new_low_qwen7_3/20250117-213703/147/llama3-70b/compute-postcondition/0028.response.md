The code `max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(e - s))` impacts the value of `max_diff` by updating it to the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `e` and `s`. Initially, `e` is 0 and `s` is 0. The absolute difference `abs(e - s)` is 0. Since `max_diff` is 2, it remains unchanged because 2 is already greater than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` has any value, `k` has any value, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2.**
