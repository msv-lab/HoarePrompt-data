Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
2. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive).
3. At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 6
   - `k` is 3
   - `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1]
   - `max_diff` is 0
   - `b` is 1
   - `e` is 1
   - `s` is 0

4. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n + 1` must still be true.
5. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
6. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. 

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 6, `k` is 3, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 0, `b` is 1, `e` is 1, `s` is 0**
