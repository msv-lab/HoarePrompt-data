Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables used in the loop, which are `b` and `n` in this case.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts with `b = 1` and continues as long as `b < n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 7 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `n` is 6 (this is the upper limit of the loop)
   - `k` is 3 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1] (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `max_diff` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `b` is 1 (initial value, but not relevant since we are looking at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `e` is 3 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `s` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `b` needs to be updated to the next value it would take in the next iteration. Since the loop increments `b` by 1 each time, and `b` was 1 at the start of the current iteration, it should now be 2.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is defined outside the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 7, `n` is 6, `k` is 3, `tabs` is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], `max_diff` is 2, `b` is 2, `e` is 3, `s` is 1**
