Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 6
   - Additional information: If `(i - b) % k != 0`, then `i` remains 2, `n` remains 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` has any value, and `k` has any value.

3. **Determine the next possible state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - The condition `(i - b) % k != 0` is not met because `(1 - b) % k != 0` (since `i` was 1 and now it's 2, the condition still holds if `b` and `k` remain unchanged).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` becomes `2` (as it is incremented by 1).
   - `n` remains `6` (no change in the loop condition).
   - `e` becomes `0` (as per the condition).
   - `s` becomes `0` (as per the condition).
   - `b` and `k` remain any value (as per the condition).

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` has any value, `k` has any value**
