Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is 6, `e` is 0 if `tabs[1] != 1` else 1, `s` is 0 if `tabs[1] != -1` else 1, `b` has any value, `k` has any value. If `(i - b) % k != 0`, the values of `e` and `s` remain as described. Since there is no else part, the values of `e` and `s` do not change regardless of the condition.***
