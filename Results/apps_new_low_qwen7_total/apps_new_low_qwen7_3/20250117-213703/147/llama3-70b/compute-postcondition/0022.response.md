The initial state is: `i` is 2, `n` is 6, `e` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` has any value, `k` has any value.

The code snippet is:
```
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

Since `i` is 2, we need to evaluate `tabs[2 - 1]`, which is `tabs[1]`.

- For the first line `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1`, this means `e += tabs[1] == 1`. However, since `tabs` is not defined or initialized, we cannot determine the exact value of `tabs[1]`. We can only say that `e` will be incremented by 1 if `tabs[1]` is equal to 1.
- For the second line `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1`, this means `s += tabs[1] == -1`. Similarly, `s` will be incremented by 1 if `tabs[1]` is equal to -1.

Since the exact value of `tabs[1]` is not given, we can only express the updated values of `e` and `s` based on the condition of `tabs[1]`. The rest of the variables (`n`, `b`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Final Output State: **i is 2, n is 6, e is 0 if tabs[1] != 1 else 1, s is 0 if tabs[1] != -1 else 1, b has any value, k has any value**
