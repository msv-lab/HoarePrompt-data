The given code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, followed by a list of integers `tabs` of length `n` where each integer is either 1 or -1. It then initializes a variable `max_diff` to 0. However, the snippet does not complete the logic to calculate `max_diff`, so we can only provide the state after these lines are executed based on the inputs provided.

Let's assume the following input for demonstration purposes:
```
6 3
1 -1 1 1 -1 1
```

After executing the code:
- `n` is set to 6 (from the first input).
- `k` is set to 3 (from the second input).
- `tabs` is set to `[1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1]` (the list of integers read from input).
- `max_diff` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **n is 6, k is 3, tabs is [1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1], max_diff is 0**
