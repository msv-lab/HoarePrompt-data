The initial state is: `i` is 3, `n` is 6, `e` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != 1` else 1), `s` is 0 (if `tabs[1] != -1` else 1), `b` has any value, `k` has any value.

The code block is:
```
e += tabs[i - 1] == 1
s += tabs[i - 1] == -1
```

Given `i` is 3, `i - 1` equals 2. So we need to check the value at `tabs[2]`.

Since the initial value of `e` is determined by whether `tabs[1] != 1`, and the initial value of `s` is determined by whether `tabs[1] != -1`, these values do not change during the execution of the given code block. Therefore, the value of `tabs[1]` is irrelevant to the changes in `e` and `s` within this block.

Let's analyze the code:
1. `e += tabs[i - 1] == 1` means `e` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[2]` is 1.
2. `s += tabs[i - 1] == -1` means `s` is incremented by 1 if `tabs[2]` is -1.

Since the problem doesn't specify the value of `tabs[2]`, we consider the most general case where `tabs[2]` can be either 1 or -1, or any other value which would make both conditions false.

If `tabs[2]` is 1, then `e` will be incremented by 1. If `tabs[2]` is -1, then `s` will be incremented by 1. If `tabs[2]` is neither 1 nor -1, then both `e` and `s` remain unchanged.

However, since the problem asks us to provide a final state based on the code execution without specifying the exact value of `tabs[2]`, we assume the most neutral case where `tabs[2]` could be any value, but the problem context suggests we should consider the initial values of `e` and `s` being 0 unless otherwise specified.

Therefore, without a specific value for `tabs[2]`, the values of `e` and `s` remain 0 after the execution of the code block. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `k`) are not affected by the code block.

Output State: **i is 3, n is 6, e is 0, s is 0, b has any value, k has any value**
