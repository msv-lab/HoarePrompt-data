The function accepts a list of integers `tabs` of length `n` where each integer is either 1 or -1, and two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k < n ≤ 100. It calculates the maximum difference between the count of 1s and -1s in any subarray of `tabs` with a sliding window size of `b` that is a multiple of `k`. The function then prints this maximum difference.
