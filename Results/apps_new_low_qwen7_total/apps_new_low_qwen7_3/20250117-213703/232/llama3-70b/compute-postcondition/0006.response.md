The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The constraints provided are for variables `n` and `a`, but these are not parameters of the function itself. The function's output depends on these variables, but since they are not passed as arguments, we need to infer their role within the function.

Given the constraints:
- `n` and `a` are integers.
- `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000`.
- `n` is even.

Since the function does not accept parameters, we cannot directly state what parameters it accepts. Instead, we can describe the expected behavior based on the provided constraints and the typical structure of such a function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the internal variables `n` and `a`, where `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `n` is even.**
