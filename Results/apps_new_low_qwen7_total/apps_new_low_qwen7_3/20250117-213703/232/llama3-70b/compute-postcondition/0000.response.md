The code `n, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `a`. Since the input is split using `map(int, ...)`, both `n` and `a` will be integers. The precondition that `1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000` and `n` is even remains valid after the code is executed.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` is an even integer between `a` and 100 000 inclusive**
