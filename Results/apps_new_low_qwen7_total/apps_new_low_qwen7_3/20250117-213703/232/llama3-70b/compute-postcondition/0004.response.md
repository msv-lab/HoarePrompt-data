Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined such that `a` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` is an even integer between `a` and 100,000 inclusive, and `a` is greater than `n // 2`.
2. The code snippet computes `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

First, let's simplify the expression:
- Let `k = n - a + 1`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `k` is a positive integer.
- The expression becomes `k // 2 + k % 2`.

This expression evaluates to `k` because:
- `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
- `k % 2` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.

If `k` is even, `k // 2` is exactly half of `k`, and `k % 2` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `k`.
If `k` is odd, `k // 2` is the integer part of `k / 2`, and `k % 2` is 1, so the expression simplifies to `k + 1`.

Since `k = n - a + 1`, we know `k` is a positive integer. Given that `a` is greater than `n // 2`, `k` will be greater than `n // 2`. Because `n` is even and between `a` and 100,000, `k` will be odd.

Therefore, the expression `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` simplifies to `n - a + 1 + 1 = n - a + 2`.

The output of the print statement is `n - a + 2`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` is an even integer between `a` and 100,000 inclusive, and the output is `n - a + 2`.**
