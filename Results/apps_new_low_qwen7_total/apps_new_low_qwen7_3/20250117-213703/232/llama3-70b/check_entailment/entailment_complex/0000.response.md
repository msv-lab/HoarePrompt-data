Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads two integers, \( n \) and \( a \).

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if \( a \leq n / 2 \).
   - If true, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) by considering the direct path for houses with odd numbers (on the left side of the street).
   - If false, it calculates the time to reach house \( a \) by considering the path through the even-numbered houses (on the right side of the street).

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - For \( a \leq n / 2 \):
     - The formula used is \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
     - This accounts for the initial 1-second travel to the first house and the subsequent travel time for each neighboring house.
   - For \( a > n / 2 \):
     - The formula used is \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).
     - This accounts for traveling to the corresponding even-numbered house and back to the starting point, then traveling to the target house.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( a = n / 2 \), the condition \( a \leq n / 2 \) is satisfied, and the calculation is correct.
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000 \) and \( n \) being even are handled appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time for Vasya to reach house \( a \).

Correctness: **True**
