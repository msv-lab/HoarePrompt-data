### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `a` from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd and Even Houses:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether `a` is on the left or right side of the street based on the condition `a <= n // 2`.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - For houses on the left side (1 to `n // 2`):
     - The distance from the start to house `a` is simply `a` because the first house is numbered 1.
     - The time to reach house `a` is `a // 2 + a % 2`. This is correct because:
       - `a // 2` accounts for the number of full houses (each taking 1 second to cross).
       - `a % 2` accounts for the remaining half-house, which takes an additional second if `a` is odd.

   - For houses on the right side (`n // 2 + 1` to `n`):
     - House `a` is opposite house `n - a + 1`.
     - The distance from the start to house `n - a + 1` is `n - a + 1`.
     - The time to reach this house is `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`. This is correct because:
       - `n - a + 1` gives the index of the house opposite to `a`.
       - `(n - a + 1) // 2` accounts for the number of full houses (each taking 1 second to cross).
       - `(n - a + 1) % 2` accounts for the remaining half-house, which takes an additional second if `n - a + 1` is odd.

#### Testing the Examples:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 2`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: House 2 is the second house on the left side.
     - Time = `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1` (This seems incorrect based on the problem statement; it should be 2 seconds).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `8 5`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: House 5 is the third house from the right.
     - Opposite house: `8 - 5 + 1 = 4` (which is the fourth house from the left).
     - Time = `(8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) % 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2` (This seems incorrect based on the problem statement; it should be 3 seconds).

Upon closer inspection, the provided examples seem to have a discrepancy with the expected outputs. Let's verify the correct outputs based on the problem description:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 2`
  - House 2 is the second house on the left side.
  - Distance: 2 houses.
  - Time: `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1` (Incorrect; should be 2 seconds).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `8 5`
  - House 5 is the third house from the right.
  - Opposite house: `8 - 5 + 1 = 4` (fourth house from the left).
  - Distance: 4 houses.
  - Time: `4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2` (Incorrect; should be 3 seconds).

The provided logic in the program is correct for the given conditions, but the outputs do not match the expected results. Therefore, the program's logic is sound, but the example outputs are incorrect.

#### Correct Outputs:
- For `4 2`: Correct output should be 2 seconds.
- For `8 5`: Correct output should be 3 seconds.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct, but the example outputs provided in the original assessment are incorrect. Given the correct logic and the provided examples, the program should be evaluated based on the correct outputs.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
