### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem description step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - Houses are numbered from 1 to \( n - 1 \) on one side and from 2 to \( n \) on the other side.
   - Vasya starts from the beginning of the street and drives to house \( a \).
   - Time to drive to houses 1 and \( n \) is 1 second.
   - Time to drive between neighboring houses is 1 second.
   - The distance between corresponding houses is the same.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads \( n \) and \( a \) from the input.
   - It checks if \( a \leq n // 2 \):
     - If true, it prints \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \).
     - If false, it prints \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \).

3. **Annotated Code and State Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly splits the problem into two cases:
     - When \( a \leq n // 2 \): The house is on the left side.
     - When \( a > n // 2 \): The house is on the right side.

4. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - For \( a \leq n // 2 \):
     - The formula \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \) correctly computes the time to reach the house:
       - For example, for \( n = 6 \) and \( a = 3 \):
         - \( a // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1 \)
         - \( a \% 2 = 3 \% 2 = 1 \)
         - Total time = \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) seconds (which is correct).
   - For \( a > n // 2 \):
     - The formula \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \) correctly computes the time to reach the house:
       - For example, for \( n = 6 \) and \( a = 4 \):
         - \( n - a + 1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3 \)
         - \( 3 // 2 = 1 \)
         - \( 3 \% 2 = 1 \)
         - Total time = \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) seconds (which is correct).
       - For \( n = 10 \) and \( a = 6 \):
         - \( n - a + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5 \)
         - \( 5 // 2 = 2 \)
         - \( 5 \% 2 = 1 \)
         - Total time = \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) seconds (which is correct).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a = n // 2 \) correctly, as it falls into the first condition.
   - The program also handles the maximum constraint on \( n \) and ensures \( n \) remains even.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly calculates the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \( a \) based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \( a \).
