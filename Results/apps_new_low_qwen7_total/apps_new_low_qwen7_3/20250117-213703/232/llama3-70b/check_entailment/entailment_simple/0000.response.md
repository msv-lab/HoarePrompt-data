### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given solution step-by-step to determine if it correctly computes the minimum time for Vasya to reach house `a`.

1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads two integers `n` and `a` from the input.
2. **Condition Check**: 
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, the code calculates the time as `a // 2 + a % 2`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time as `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

#### Case 1: `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`

- Since the houses with odd numbers are on one side and even numbers on the other, for the first half of the street (houses 1 to n//2), the distance from the start to any odd-numbered house is directly given by `a // 2` (since every second house is odd).
- If `a` is odd, the additional step is `1` due to the modulus operation (`a % 2`).

#### Case 2: `a` is greater than `n // 2`

- For the second half of the street (houses n to n//2+1), the opposite house would be at position `n - a + 1`.
- Similarly, the distance from the start to this opposite house is calculated as `(n - a + 1) // 2`.
- If the house is even (i.e., `n - a + 1` is odd), the additional step is `1` due to the modulus operation (`(n - a + 1) % 2`).

Both cases correctly account for the time taken to reach the respective positions considering the constraints of the problem.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 2`
  - Since `a` is less than `n // 2`, the time is `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.
  - However, since Vasya starts from the beginning and needs to go to house 2, which is on the right side, he takes 1 second to reach house 1 and then 1 second to reach house 2. Hence, total time is `2` seconds.
  
- **Example 2**: `n = 8`, `a = 5`
  - Since `a` is greater than `n // 2`, we calculate for the opposite house: `8 - 5 + 1 = 4`.
  - Time is `(4 // 2) + (4 % 2) = 2 + 0 = 2`.
  - Opposite house is house 4, and the total time to reach house 4 from the start is `2` seconds (to reach house 8 and then back to house 4).

### Conclusion:

The logic in the provided function accurately computes the minimum time required for Vasya to reach house `a` based on the given constraints and conditions. Therefore, the function is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
