You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. [Image] 

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( a \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000 \) and \( n \) is even. It then prints one of two possible values based on the comparison of \( a \) and \( n/2 \). Specifically, if \( a \leq n/2 \), it prints \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \). Otherwise, it prints \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \). The function does not return a value but modifies the standard output directly. Potential edge cases include when \( a \) is exactly \( n/2 \), which falls under the first condition. The function also handles the maximum constraint on \( n \) and ensures \( n \) remains even throughout the process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house \(a\). Let's consider the following test case:

For \(n = 6\) and \(a = 4\):

- According to the problem description, house 4 is the third house from the end of the street, which means it is opposite house 2.
- The distance from the start of the street to house 2 is 2 seconds (1 second to reach house 1 and 1 second to reach house 2).
- Therefore, the minimum time to reach house 4 should be 2 seconds.

However, the program calculates:
- Since \(a = 4\) is greater than \(n//2 = 3\), it uses the second part of the condition: \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2\).
- This results in \((6 - 4 + 1) // 2 + (6 - 4 + 1) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2\).

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another case:

For \(n = 6\) and \(a = 3\):

- According to the problem description, house 3 is the second house from the start of the street.
- The distance from the start of the street to house 3 is 2 seconds (1 second to reach house 1 and 1 second to reach house 3).
- Therefore, the minimum time to reach house 3 should be 2 seconds.

However, the program calculates:
- Since \(a = 3\) is less than or equal to \(n//2 = 3\), it uses the first part of the condition: \(a // 2 + a \% 2\).
- This results in \(3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2\).

This seems correct as well. However, let's consider a more complex case:

For \(n = 10\) and \(a = 6\):

- According to the problem description, house 6 is the fifth house from the end of the street, which means it is opposite house 5.
- The distance from the start of the street to house 5 is 4 seconds (1 second to reach house 1, 1 second to reach house 2, 1 second to reach house 3, and 1 second to reach house 5).
- Therefore, the minimum time to reach house 6 should be 4 seconds.

However, the program calculates:
- Since \(a = 6\) is greater than \(n//2 = 5\), it uses the second part of the condition: \((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2\).
- This results in \((10 - 6 + 1) // 2 + (10 - 6 + 1) \% 2 = 5 // 2 + 5 \% 2 = 2 + 1 = 3\).

This is incorrect because the correct answer should be 4 seconds.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
