You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The main street of Berland is a straight line with n houses built along it (n is an even number). The houses are located at both sides of the street. The houses with odd numbers are at one side of the street and are numbered from 1 to n - 1 in the order from the beginning of the street to the end (in the picture: from left to right). The houses with even numbers are at the other side of the street and are numbered from 2 to n in the order from the end of the street to its beginning (in the picture: from right to left). The corresponding houses with even and odd numbers are strictly opposite each other, that is, house 1 is opposite house n, house 3 is opposite house n - 2, house 5 is opposite house n - 4 and so on. [Image] 

Vasya needs to get to house number a as quickly as possible. He starts driving from the beginning of the street and drives his car to house a. To get from the beginning of the street to houses number 1 and n, he spends exactly 1 second. He also spends exactly one second to drive the distance between two neighbouring houses. Vasya can park at any side of the road, so the distance between the beginning of the street at the houses that stand opposite one another should be considered the same.

Your task is: find the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house a.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers, n and a (1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of houses on the street and the number of the house that Vasya needs to reach, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that number n is even.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum time Vasya needs to get from the beginning of the street to house a.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2

Output
2

Input
8 5

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample there are only four houses on the street, two houses at each side. House 2 will be the last at Vasya's right.

The second sample corresponds to picture with n = 8. House 5 is the one before last at Vasya's left.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if a <= n // 2:
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else:
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and a are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and n is even.
def func():
    n, a = map(int, input().split())
    if (a <= n // 2) :
        print(a // 2 + a % 2)
    else :
        print((n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` is an even integer between `a` and 100,000 inclusive. If `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, the value of `a` is printed as `a // 2 + a % 2`. Otherwise, the output is `n - a + 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly computes the minimum time Vasya needs to reach house `a`.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program takes two integers `n` and `a` as input.
   - It uses `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input values to integers, which is correct for this problem.

2. **Odd and Even Houses:**
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, it means house `a` is on the left side of the street.
   - Otherwise, house `a` is on the right side of the street.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - For houses on the left side (1 to `n // 2`):
     - Vasya needs to drive directly to house `a`. 
     - The distance from the start to house `a` is `a` (since the first house is 1).
     - Since he spends 1 second to travel from the start to house 1 and 1 second per house thereafter, the total time is `a // 2 + a % 2`.
   - For houses on the right side (`n // 2 + 1` to `n`):
     - House `a` is opposite house `n - a + 1`.
     - The distance from the start to house `n - a + 1` is `n - a + 1`.
     - The time to reach this house is `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2`.

Given these calculations, let's test the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: House 2 is the second house on the left side.
    - Time = `2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1` (this seems incorrect based on the problem statement; it should be 2 seconds).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `8 5`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: House 5 is the third house from the right.
    - Opposite house: `8 - 5 + 1 = 4` (which is the fourth house from the left).
    - Time = `(8 - 5 + 1) // 2 + (8 - 5 + 1) % 2 = 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2` (this seems incorrect based on the problem statement; it should be 3 seconds).

Upon closer inspection, the formula `a // 2 + a % 2` and `(n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) % 2` is correct for the given conditions but the logic needs to ensure the correct distance is calculated properly. Let's correct the output for the examples:

- For `4 2`: Correct output should be 2 seconds.
- For `8 5`: Correct output should be 3 seconds.

The program logic appears to be correct based on the provided examples, but we need to ensure the distance calculation is accurate for all cases.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and examples given.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
