Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum time for Vasya to reach house \( a \) from the beginning of the street.
2. The given solution correctly handles the two cases based on whether \( a \leq \frac{n}{2} \) or \( a > \frac{n}{2} \).
   - If \( a \leq \frac{n}{2} \), the time taken is effectively the index of the house divided by 2 plus a potential half-second due to the odd-numbered nature of the house.
   - If \( a > \frac{n}{2} \), the equivalent house on the opposite side would be \( n - a + 1 \), and the calculation follows the same logic.
3. The solution uses integer division (`//`) and modulus (`%`) operations to compute the exact time spent, which matches the problem's requirements.
4. The conditions handle all valid inputs as specified (with \( 1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000 \) and \( n \) being even).

Given the execution summary, the provided Python function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum time based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
