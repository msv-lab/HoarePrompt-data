The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( a \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq a \leq n \leq 100,000 \) and \( n \) is even. It then prints one of two possible values based on the comparison of \( a \) and \( n/2 \). Specifically, if \( a \leq n/2 \), it prints \( a // 2 + a \% 2 \). Otherwise, it prints \( (n - a + 1) // 2 + (n - a + 1) \% 2 \). The function does not return a value but modifies the standard output directly. Potential edge cases include when \( a \) is exactly \( n/2 \), which falls under the first condition. The function also handles the maximum constraint on \( n \) and ensures \( n \) remains even throughout the process.
