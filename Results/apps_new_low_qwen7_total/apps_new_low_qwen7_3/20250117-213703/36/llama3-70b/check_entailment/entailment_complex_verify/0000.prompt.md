You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The flag of Berland is such rectangular field n × m that satisfies following conditions:

  Flag consists of three colors which correspond to letters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.  Flag consists of three equal in width and height stripes, parralel to each other and to sides of the flag. Each stripe has exactly one color.  Each color should be used in exactly one stripe. 

You are given a field n × m, consisting of characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'. Output "YES" (without quotes) if this field corresponds to correct flag of Berland. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the sizes of the field.

Each of the following n lines consisting of m characters 'R', 'G' and 'B' — the description of the field.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the given field corresponds to correct flag of Berland . Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
GGGGG

Output
YES

Input
4 3
BRG
BRG
BRG
BRG

Output
YES

Input
6 7
RRRGGGG
RRRGGGG
RRRGGGG
RRRBBBB
RRRBBBB
RRRBBBB

Output
NO

Input
4 4
RRRR
RRRR
BBBB
GGGG

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The field in the third example doesn't have three parralel stripes.

Rows of the field in the fourth example are parralel to each other and to borders. But they have different heights — 2, 1 and 1.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    rows = len(set((''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3))))
    cols = len((set(''.join((row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field))) for i in range(3)))
    print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two space-separated integers n and m representing the dimensions of the field (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), followed by n lines, each containing m characters that are either 'R', 'G', or 'B'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

field = [input() for _ in range(n)]

rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))

cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for
    i in range(3))

print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a matrix of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is either 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It checks whether the matrix can be divided into 3x3 submatrices such that each submatrix contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If all such 3x3 submatrices meet this condition, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly verify that the flag has three parallel stripes with each color used exactly once. Specifically, the program checks if the number of unique rows and columns formed by dividing the flag into three equal parts is 3, but it does not ensure that each of these rows or columns contains only one color. This means that the program might incorrectly identify a flag as valid if the stripes are not properly aligned or if the colors are mixed within the stripes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
GGGGG
```
This flag is correct according to the problem description. However, the program would also consider the following flag as correct, which is incorrect:
```
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
RGGBB
```
In this case, the last row mixes the colors, but the program does not check for this and would still output "YES". Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
