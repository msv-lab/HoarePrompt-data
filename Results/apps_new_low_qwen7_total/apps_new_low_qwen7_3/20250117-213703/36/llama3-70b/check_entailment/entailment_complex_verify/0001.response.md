### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The goal is to verify if the given \(n \times m\) grid (consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B') represents a valid flag of Berland, which must consist of three parallel stripes of equal size, each stripe being a single color.

2. **Code Breakdown:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     ```python
     (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
     field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
     ```
     This part reads the dimensions and the field from the input.
   - **Creating Horizontal Stripes:**
     ```python
     rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))
     ```
     Here, the program creates horizontal stripes by concatenating every \(\frac{n}{3}\) rows. The use of `set` ensures that each unique combination of colors in these stripes is counted.
   - **Creating Vertical Stripes:**
     ```python
     cols = len((set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field)) for i in range(3)))
     ```
     This part creates vertical stripes by slicing every \(\frac{m}{3}\) columns and checking the uniqueness of each stripe.
   - **Validation:**
     ```python
     print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
     ```
     Finally, the program prints 'YES' if there are exactly three unique horizontal and three unique vertical stripes, otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Annotations vs. Problem Description:**
   - The annotation states that the function checks both rows and columns to ensure there are exactly three parallel stripes with unique colors. However, the actual implementation does not follow this requirement accurately. Instead, it checks for unique combinations of colors across slices, which does not guarantee that the stripes are parallel and each stripe is a single color.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     9 6
     RRRGGGBBB
     RRRGGGBBB
     RRRGGGBBB
     GGGRRRBRR
     GGGRRRBRR
     GGGRRRBRR
     BBBGGGRGG
     BBBGGGRGG
     BBBGGGRGG
     ```
   - According to the current implementation, the program will count unique combinations, but the stripes are not parallel and do not meet the requirement of having each stripe as a single color. For instance, the first horizontal slice (first 3 rows) contains 'RRRGGGBBB', which is not a single color.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the requirement of having three parallel stripes with unique colors. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
