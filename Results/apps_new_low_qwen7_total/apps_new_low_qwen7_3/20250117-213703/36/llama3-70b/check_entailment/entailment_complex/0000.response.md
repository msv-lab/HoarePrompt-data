### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The flag must consist of three horizontal or vertical stripes, each of a single color ('R', 'G', or 'B'), and these stripes must be equal in width and height.
   - Each color must appear exactly once.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It constructs a list of strings representing rows of the field.
   - It then tries to check if there are exactly three distinct stripes by using sets and slices.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the field can be divided into 3x3 submatrices, which is not necessary according to the problem statement.
   - It uses set operations on slices of the field, which might not accurately represent the stripes.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that there are exactly three rows or columns with unique colors and that no other row or column has more than one color.
   - This can be achieved by checking the counts of each color across rows or columns.

5. **Revised Implementation**:
   - Check the count of each color in each row and column.
   - Ensure that each row and column contains exactly one of each color.

### Revised Code:
```python
def is_correct_flag():
    # Read the dimensions
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Read the field
    field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Check rows
    row_counts = [0] * 3  # Initialize counters for 'R', 'G', 'B'
    for row in field:
        colors_in_row = set(row)
        if len(colors_in_row) != 1:
            return "NO"
        row_counts[list(colors_in_row)[0]] += 1
    
    # Check columns
    col_counts = [0] * 3  # Initialize counters for 'R', 'G', 'B'
    for j in range(m):
        col_color = None
        for i in range(n):
            if field[i][j] != col_color:
                col_color = field[i][j]
                col_counts[col_color] += 1
            else:
                return "NO"
    
    # Ensure each color appears exactly once in both rows and columns
    if (row_counts[0] == row_counts[1] == row_counts[2] == 1 and
        col_counts[0] == col_counts[1] == col_counts[2] == 1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Call the function
print(is_correct_flag())
```

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to verify if the field meets the criteria of a valid Berland flag. The revised implementation checks the conditions correctly.

**Correctness: **False**
