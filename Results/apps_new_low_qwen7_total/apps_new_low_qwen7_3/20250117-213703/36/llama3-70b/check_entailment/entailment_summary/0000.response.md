Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. The program's logic is focused on checking for specific patterns within 3x3 submatrices rather than verifying if the entire matrix meets the criteria of having three parallel stripes with each stripe containing only one color and being of equal size.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
1. **Stripe Validation**: The problem requires validating that the entire field consists of three parallel stripes, each with a single color, and all stripes are of equal width and height. The program does not explicitly check these conditions.
2. **3x3 Submatrix Logic**: The program attempts to validate the field using 3x3 submatrices, which is an incorrect approach. This method does not ensure that the entire field meets the required conditions of having three parallel stripes.
3. **Stripe Identification**: The program uses sets and joins to form strings representing potential stripes, but it does not correctly identify or validate the actual stripes as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program does not accurately solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
