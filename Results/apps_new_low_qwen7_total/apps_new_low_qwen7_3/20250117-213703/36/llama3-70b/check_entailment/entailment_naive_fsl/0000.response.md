Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly verify that the flag has three parallel stripes with each color used exactly once. Specifically, the program checks if the number of unique rows and columns formed by dividing the flag into three equal parts is 3, but it does not ensure that each of these rows or columns contains only one color. This means that the program might incorrectly identify a flag as valid if the stripes are not properly aligned or if the colors are mixed within the stripes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
GGGGG
```
This flag is correct according to the problem description. However, the program would also consider the following flag as correct, which is incorrect:
```
Input
6 5
RRRRR
RRRRR
BBBBB
BBBBB
GGGGG
RGGBB
```
In this case, the last row mixes the colors, but the program does not check for this and would still output "YES". Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
