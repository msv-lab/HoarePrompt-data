Functionality: **The function processes a matrix of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is either 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It checks whether the matrix can be divided into 3x3 submatrices such that each submatrix contains exactly one 'R', one 'G', and one 'B'. If all such 3x3 submatrices meet this condition, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the dimensions of the matrix are not divisible by 3 (i.e., `n % 3 != 0` or `m % 3 != 0`), the function will still attempt to process the matrix, which will result in incorrect results since the division into 3x3 submatrices cannot be performed evenly.
- If the input matrix contains fewer than 9 distinct 3x3 submatrices (which would happen if `min(n, m) < 3`), the function will still execute but will not check all possible submatrices, leading to incomplete validation.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle cases where the input matrix dimensions are not multiples of 3. This means that the function may produce incorrect results for non-multiples of 3 in either dimension.
- The code does not validate the input constraints (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`) explicitly, which could lead to undefined behavior if these constraints are violated.
