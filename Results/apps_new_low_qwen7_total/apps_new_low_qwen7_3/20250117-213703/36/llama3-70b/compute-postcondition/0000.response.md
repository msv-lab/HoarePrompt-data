To analyze the given code block, let's break it down step by step while keeping track of the state changes:

### Initial State
- The input consists of two space-separated integers \( n \) and \( m \) representing the dimensions of the field.
- Followed by \( n \) lines, each containing \( m \) characters that are either 'R', 'G', or 'B'.

### Code Execution

1. **Reading Input**
   ```python
   n, m = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   - Reads two space-separated integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
   - Example: If the input is "3 3", then \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 3 \).

2. **Building the Field**
   ```python
   field = [input() for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   - Constructs a list of strings (`field`) where each string represents a row of the field.
   - Example: If the input is "RRG\nRGB\nGBB", then `field` would be `['RRG', 'RGB', 'GBB']`.

3. **Calculating Rows**
   ```python
   rows = len(set(''.join(field[i::n // 3]) for i in range(n // 3)))
   ```
   - For each group of 3 rows (or fewer if \( n \) is not divisible by 3), joins the corresponding rows and adds them to a set to eliminate duplicates.
   - The length of this set gives the number of unique groups of rows.
   - Example: For the above field, the groups are `['RRG', 'RGB', 'GBB']`, so `rows = 3`.

4. **Calculating Columns**
   ```python
   cols = len(set(''.join(row[i * m // 3:(i + 1) * m // 3] for row in field) for i in range(3)))
   ```
   - For each group of 3 columns (or fewer if \( m \) is not divisible by 3), extracts the corresponding columns from each row and joins them to form a string, adding each to a set.
   - The length of this set gives the number of unique groups of columns.
   - Example: For the above field, the groups are `['RRG', 'RGB', 'GBB']` vertically stacked, so `cols = 3`.

5. **Printing Result**
   ```python
   print('YES' if rows == 3 and cols == 3 else 'NO')
   ```
   - Checks if both `rows` and `cols` are 3.
   - Prints 'YES' if they are, otherwise prints 'NO'.
   - Based on the example, since both `rows` and `cols` are 3, the output would be 'YES'.

### Final Output State
- \( n \) and \( m \) remain unchanged as they are read from input.
- `field` contains the grid as entered.
- `rows` and `cols` are computed based on the input grid.
- The output is 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the values of `rows` and `cols`.

Given the analysis, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is n, m is m, field is ['RRG', 'RGB', 'GBB'], rows is 3, cols is 3, the output is 'YES'**
