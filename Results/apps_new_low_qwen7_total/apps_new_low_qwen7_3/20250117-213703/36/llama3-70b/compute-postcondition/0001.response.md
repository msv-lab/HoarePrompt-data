The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. Instead, it appears that the parameters `n` and `m` are provided in the input, along with an additional matrix of characters. The function processes this input but since the parameters are not part of the function definition, they are considered external inputs.

Based on the description, the function accepts the following:
- Two space-separated integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the field (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
- A matrix of `n` lines, each containing `m` characters that are either 'R', 'G', or 'B'.

The function's output is not specified directly in the question, but we can infer that it likely returns some form of result based on the processing of the input matrix. Since no specific output is mentioned, we'll assume the function returns a value or result derived from the input matrix.

Functionality: **The function processes a matrix of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is either 'R', 'G', or 'B'. It returns a result based on the processing of this matrix.**
