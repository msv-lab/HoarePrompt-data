The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. 

- `line1` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment as `(A_i, B_i, C_i)` with `A_i < B_i` and `C_i` being the y-coordinate of the segment.
- `line2` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment as `(D_j, E_j, F_j)` with `E_j < F_j` and `D_j` being the x-coordinate of the segment.

The function has three possible return points:
- Case_1: The function returns `False`.
- Case_2: The function returns `True`.
- Case_3: The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `line1` and `line2`, and based on certain conditions, it returns either `True` or `False`. Specifically, it returns `False` in two cases and `True` in one case.
