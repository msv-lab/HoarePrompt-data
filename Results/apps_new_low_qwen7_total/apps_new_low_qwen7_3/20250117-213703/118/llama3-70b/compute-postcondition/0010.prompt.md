You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: line1 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment as (A_i, B_i, C_i) with A_i < B_i and C_i being the y-coordinate of the segment. Similarly, line2 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment as (D_j, E_j, F_j) with E_j < F_j and D_j being the x-coordinate of the segment.
def func_1(line1, line2):
    x1, y1, x2 = line1

x3, y3, x4 = line2

denom = (x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4)
    if (denom == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: line1 is a list of tuples, line2 is a list of tuples, denom is a calculated value based on the given formula using elements from line1 and line2, and denom is not equal to 0
    t = ((x1 - x3) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y3) * (x3 - x4)) / denom

u = -((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y3) - (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3)) / denom
    if (0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= u <= 1) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: line1 is a list of tuples, line2 is a list of tuples, t is a calculated value, u is a calculated value, denom is a calculated value based on the given formula using elements from line1 and line2, and denom is not equal to 0, either 0 > t or t > 1, or 0 > u or u > 1
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. 
#
#- `line1` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment as `(A_i, B_i, C_i)` with `A_i < B_i` and `C_i` being the y-coordinate of the segment.
#- `line2` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment as `(D_j, E_j, F_j)` with `E_j < F_j` and `D_j` being the x-coordinate of the segment.
#
#The function has three possible return points:
#- Case_1: The function returns `False`.
#- Case_2: The function returns `True`.
#- Case_3: The function returns `False`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `line1` and `line2`, and based on certain conditions, it returns either `True` or `False`. Specifically, it returns `False` in two cases and `True` in one case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
