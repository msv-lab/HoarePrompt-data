Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. `line1` is a list of tuples representing north-south line segments, and `line2` is a list of tuples representing east-west line segments. The function calculates a determinant (`denom`) derived from the coordinates of these line segments. If the determinant is zero, indicating that the lines are parallel, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it computes values `t` and `u` which represent the intersection point's relative position on the segments. If both `t` and `u` lie within the range `[0, 1]`, indicating that the intersection point lies on both segments, the function returns `True`. In all other cases, the function returns `False`.**

This summary covers all the possible outcomes and includes the potential edge case where the determinant is zero, as well as the conditions under which `t` and `u` must lie to return `True`.
