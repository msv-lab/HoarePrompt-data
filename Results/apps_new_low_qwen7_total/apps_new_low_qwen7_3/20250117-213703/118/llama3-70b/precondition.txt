line1 and line2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two segments on the field. Each segment is defined by four integers (A_i, B_i, C_i) for north-south lines and (D_j, E_j, F_j) for east-west lines, where the segment for north-south lines connects (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the segment for east-west lines connects (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
