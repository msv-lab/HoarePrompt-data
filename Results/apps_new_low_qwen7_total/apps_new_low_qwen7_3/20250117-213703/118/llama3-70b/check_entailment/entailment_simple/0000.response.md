Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Lines**: The program correctly sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates respectively. This is essential for determining the boundaries of the reachable area.

2. **Collecting Points**: The program collects unique x and y coordinates from the north-south and east-west lines. It avoids adding duplicate points and includes points that intersect the lines to define the boundaries of the reachable area.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to check if two line segments intersect. The logic used in `func_1` is correct:
   - The denominator checks if the lines are parallel (denom == 0). If they are, the function returns `False`.
   - The `t` and `u` values are calculated to check if the intersection point lies within both line segments. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Calculating Area**: The program calculates the area by iterating over the sorted x and y points and using the Shoelace formula (or Gauss's area formula for polygons). If no area is found (i.e., the result is zero), it prints "INF" indicating the area is infinite. Otherwise, it prints the calculated area.

Given the logical correctness of the sorting, point collection, intersection checking, and area calculation, the program should work as intended under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
