### Reasoning:

The original assessment is generally accurate, but there are some key points and potential issues that need to be thoroughly evaluated.

1. **Input Handling and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of north-south and east-west lines and their respective coordinates.
   - The lines are sorted based on their y and x coordinates, which is correct for identifying the boundaries accurately.

2. **Identifying Boundary Points**:
   - The logic for adding x-coordinates and y-coordinates to the sets \(x\_points\) and \(y\_points\) is correct.
   - The check for intersections between north-south and east-west lines using the `func_1` function is also correct.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area calculation seems to follow the logic implied by the provided code. However, the actual implementation of the Shoelace formula is missing, which is a crucial part of the algorithm.
   - The area calculation is performed by iterating over the sorted x and y points, but the exact formula used for the area is not shown in the provided code.

4. **Handling Infinite Area**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the area is zero by printing 'INF'.

### Detailed Evaluation:

#### Issue 1: Missing Shoelace Formula Implementation
The code calculates the area using a loop, but the actual Shoelace formula is not implemented. The loop is performing the multiplication and summation steps, but the final addition and subtraction required by the Shoelace formula are missing. This could lead to an incorrect area calculation.

#### Issue 2: Redundant Loops
The nested loops for checking intersections between north-south and east-west lines are unnecessary and inefficient. Given the constraints (up to 1000 segments), this could potentially cause performance issues, although it might not affect correctness under the given constraints.

#### Issue 3: Set vs. List Conversion
The x-points and y-points are converted from sets to lists before calculating the area. While this is fine, using sets ensures uniqueness, which is important for boundary points. However, the conversion back to a list might not be necessary if the area calculation can handle sets directly.

### Conclusion:
While the overall logic of the program is correct and follows the problem requirements, there are critical implementation details missing. Specifically, the area calculation is incomplete without the Shoelace formula, which is essential for accurate area computation.

Given these issues, the original assessment should be overturned.

### Final:
**False**
