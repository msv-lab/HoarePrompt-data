### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and its behavior step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### 1. Input Parsing and Sorting:
- The program reads the number of north-south and east-west lines and their respective coordinates.
- It sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates and x-coordinates respectively.

#### 2. Identifying Intersection Points:
- The program iterates through pairs of north-south and east-west lines to check for intersections using the `func_1` function.
- If an intersection is found, the corresponding x and y coordinates are added to sets `x_points` and `y_points`.

#### 3. Determining the Boundaries:
- After identifying all intersection points, the sets `x_points` and `y_points` are converted into sorted lists.
- The program then calculates the area by iterating over all adjacent pairs of x and y points, summing up the areas of rectangles formed by these points.

#### 4. Handling Infinite Area:
- If no valid rectangles are formed (i.e., the area is zero), the program prints "INF" to indicate that the area is infinite.

#### 5. Function `func_1`:
- The `func_1` function correctly checks for intersection between a north-south line and an east-west line by calculating the determinant and solving for `t` and `u`.
- If the intersection lies within the segments, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Analysis:
- The core issue identified in the original assessment is the handling of intersecting lines and the formation of enclosed regions.
- The program correctly identifies intersection points and forms sets of x and y points. However, it does not explicitly determine the boundaries of the enclosed regions.
- The program assumes that the area can be computed by simply summing up the areas of the rectangles formed by the points. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the actual geometry of the intersecting lines.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the provided sample input:
  ```
  5 5
  1 2 0
  0 1 1
  0 2 2
  -3 4 -1
  -2 6 3
  1 0 1
  0 1 2
  2 0 2
  -1 -4 5
  3 -2 4
  1 2 4
  ```

- The lines form several enclosed regions. For instance, the lines (1, 2, 0), (0, 1, 1), and (0, 2, 2) form a triangular region.
- The program incorrectly sums the areas of all possible rectangles, leading to an overestimate of the total area.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the geometry of the intersecting lines and the formation of enclosed regions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
