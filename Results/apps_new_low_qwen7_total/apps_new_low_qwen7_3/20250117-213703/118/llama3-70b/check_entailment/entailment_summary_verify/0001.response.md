### Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of north-south and east-west lines and their respective coordinates. This part is correct.
2. **Sorting Lines**: The north-south and east-west lines are sorted based on their y and x coordinates, respectively. This is necessary to identify the boundaries accurately. However, the sorting logic can be simplified since we only need to sort the start and end points of the lines.
3. **Identifying Boundary Points**:
   - The program adds x-coordinates from pairs of north-south lines with the same y-coordinate to the set of x-points. This ensures that vertical boundaries are correctly identified.
   - The program adds y-coordinates from pairs of east-west lines with the same x-coordinate to the set of y-points. This ensures that horizontal boundaries are correctly identified.
   - The program also checks for intersections between north-south and east-west lines to add additional boundary points if necessary. This is done using the `func_1` function, which correctly identifies if the lines intersect.
4. **Calculating the Area**:
   - The x-points and y-points are sorted and used to calculate the area of the region. This is done by iterating over the sorted x and y points and applying the Shoelace formula. However, the area calculation logic is not explicitly shown in the provided code. We assume it uses the Shoelace formula based on the context.
5. **Handling Infinite Area**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the calculated area is zero by printing 'INF'. This indicates that the area is infinite.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated area.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for identifying boundary points and calculating the area. Specifically, the program only considers intersections between lines of different types (north-south and east-west) but does not account for the possibility that a single north-south or east-west line might completely block the cow from moving in certain directions. 

For example, if there is a north-south line at \(x = 1\) and the cow starts at \(x = 0\), the cow cannot move to the right beyond \(x = 1\). Similarly, if there is an east-west line at \(y = 1\) and the cow starts at \(y = 0\), the cow cannot move up beyond \(y = 1\). The current implementation does not account for such scenarios, leading to an incorrect area calculation.

### Final Evaluation

Given the critical flaw in the logic for identifying and handling boundary points, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the region the cow can reach.

**Final: False**
