Reasoning:
To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the key components and logic:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of north-south and east-west lines, and their respective coordinates.
   - It sorts the north-south and east-west lines based on their y-coordinates (or x-coordinates) which is crucial for determining the boundaries of the reachable area.

2. **Identifying Intersection Points:**
   - The program identifies intersection points between north-south and east-west lines.
   - It ensures that the intersection points do not lie on the same vertical or horizontal line, avoiding redundant points.

3. **Determining Reachable Area:**
   - The program sorts the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the intersection points.
   - It calculates the area by iterating over the sorted x and y points and computing the area using the formula for the area of a polygon formed by the sorted points.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if the calculated area is zero, indicating that the area is finite. If so, it prints "INF" to indicate an infinite area.

Given the execution summary and the logical steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the identification of valid intersection points and correctly computes the area of the reachable region. 

Correctness: **True**
