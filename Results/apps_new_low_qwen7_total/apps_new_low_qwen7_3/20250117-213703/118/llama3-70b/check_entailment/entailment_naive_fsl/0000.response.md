Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the area when there are intersecting lines or when the lines form enclosed regions. Specifically, the current implementation of `func_1` checks for intersection but does not correctly determine the boundaries of the reachable area. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 2 0
0 1 1
0 2 2
-3 4 -1
-2 6 3
1 0 1
0 1 2
2 0 2
-1 -4 5
3 -2 4
1 2 4
```

This input represents a scenario where the lines form enclosed regions, and the program should calculate the area of these regions. However, the current implementation does not properly account for these intersections and thus cannot accurately compute the area of the reachable region. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated geometry algorithms to determine the bounded regions formed by the intersection of the lines.
