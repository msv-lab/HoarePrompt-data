Reasoning:
1. The given program aims to find the area of the region the cow can reach while avoiding crossing the given segments.
2. The main logic of the program involves sorting the north-south and east-west lines and then determining the boundary points (x and y coordinates) that the cow can reach.
3. It checks for intersections between the north-south and east-west lines to ensure the boundaries are correctly identified.
4. After identifying the boundary points, it calculates the area of the resulting polygon using the Shoelace formula (though this part is not explicitly shown in the provided code, it's implied through the area calculation).

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of north-south and east-west lines and their respective coordinates.
2. **Sorting Lines**: The north-south and east-west lines are sorted based on their y and x coordinates, respectively. This is necessary to identify the boundaries accurately.
3. **Identifying Boundary Points**:
   - For each pair of north-south lines, if they have the same y-coordinate, it adds their x-coordinates to the set of x-points.
   - For each pair of east-west lines, if they have the same x-coordinate, it adds their y-coordinates to the set of y-points.
   - It also checks for intersections between north-south and east-west lines to add additional boundary points if necessary.
4. **Calculating the Area**:
   - The x-points and y-points are sorted and used to calculate the area of the region.
   - The area is calculated by iterating over the sorted x and y points and applying the Shoelace formula.
5. **Handling Infinite Area**:
   - If the calculated area is zero, it prints 'INF' indicating the area is infinite.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated area.

Given that the provided solution follows the correct logic to identify boundary points and calculate the area, and considering the constraints and problem requirements, the provided code appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
