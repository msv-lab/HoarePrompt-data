line1 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment as (A_i, B_i, C_i) with A_i < B_i and C_i being the y-coordinate of the segment. Similarly, line2 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment as (D_j, E_j, F_j) with E_j < F_j and D_j being the x-coordinate of the segment.
