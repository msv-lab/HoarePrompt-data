#State of the program right berfore the function call: line1 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a north-south line segment as (A_i, B_i, C_i) with A_i < B_i and C_i being the y-coordinate of the segment. Similarly, line2 is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an east-west line segment as (D_j, E_j, F_j) with E_j < F_j and D_j being the x-coordinate of the segment.

    x1, y1, x2 = line1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `line1` and `line2`. `line1` is a list of tuples representing north-south line segments, and `line2` is a list of tuples representing east-west line segments. The function calculates a determinant (`denom`) derived from the coordinates of these line segments. If the determinant is zero, indicating that the lines are parallel, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it computes values `t` and `u` which represent the intersection point's relative position on the segments. If both `t` and `u` lie within the range `[0, 1]`, indicating that the intersection point lies on both segments, the function returns `True`. In all other cases, the function returns `False`.
