The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and a string `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only '0' and '1'). It then iterates over all binary strings of length `n`, checking if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring within these binary strings. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. If the length of `s` is not within the specified range, the function prints an error message.
