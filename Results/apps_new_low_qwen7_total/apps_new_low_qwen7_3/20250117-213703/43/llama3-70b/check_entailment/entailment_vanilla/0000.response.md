Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain a given binary string \( s \) as a substring.
   - A cyclical string \( t \) contains \( s \) if \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a brute-force approach by generating all possible binary strings of length \( n \).
   - It checks each generated binary string to see if it contains \( s \) as a substring under any cyclical shift.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The program generates all binary strings of length \( n \) using a loop with `range(2 ** n)`.
   - Each binary string \( t \) is generated using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`, which converts an integer \( i \) into a binary string of length \( n \).
   - The condition `all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)))` checks if \( s \) is a substring of \( t \) after any cyclical shift.
     - This is done by checking every possible starting position `i` within the string \( t \).
     - It checks both direct slices (`t[i:i + len(s)]`) and cyclical slices (`t[i + len(s):] + t[:i]`).

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the cyclical nature of the strings by checking all possible shifts.
   - The condition ensures that \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).
   - The program counts and prints the number of valid strings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should work for all given constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \) and \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \).

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
