Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the program checks for all possible binary strings of length \( n \) and checks if \( s \) is a substring after all possible cyclical shifts of these strings. However, it does not ensure that each cyclical string is counted only once.

Consider the following input:
```
4
0000
```

The correct output should be 1 because there is only one distinct cyclical binary string "0000" that contains "0000" as a substring. However, the given program will incorrectly count multiple instances of "0000" due to the way it checks for cyclical shifts and substrings.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each cyclical string is considered uniquely. One way to do this is by converting the binary string to a set of its cyclical shifts and checking if \( s \) is a substring of any of these shifts. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = 0
    seen = set()
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        seen.add(t)
    for t in seen:
        for i in range(n):
            rotated_t = t[i:] + t[:i]
            if s in rotated_t:
                count += 1
                break
    print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each cyclical string is considered uniquely by storing all unique strings in a set and then checking if \( s \) is a substring of any of these unique strings.
