You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        if all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))):
            count += 1
    print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and a string `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only '0' and '1'). It then iterates over all binary strings of length `n`, checking if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring within these binary strings. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. If the length of `s` is not within the specified range, the function prints an error message.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain a given binary string \( s \) as a substring.
   - A cyclical string \( t \) contains \( s \) if \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a brute-force approach by generating all possible binary strings of length \( n \).
   - It checks each generated binary string to see if it contains \( s \) as a substring under any cyclical shift.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The program generates all binary strings of length \( n \) using a loop with `range(2 ** n)`.
   - Each binary string \( t \) is generated using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`, which converts an integer \( i \) into a binary string of length \( n \).
   - The condition `all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)))` checks if \( s \) is a substring of \( t \) after any cyclical shift.
     - This is done by checking every possible starting position `i` within the string \( t \).
     - It checks both direct slices (`t[i:i + len(s)]`) and cyclical slices (`t[i + len(s):] + t[:i]`).

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the cyclical nature of the strings by checking all possible shifts.
   - The condition ensures that \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).
   - The program counts and prints the number of valid strings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should work for all given constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \) and \( 1 \leq |s| \leq n \).

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
