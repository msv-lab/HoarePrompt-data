You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        if all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))):
            count += 1
    print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and a string `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only '0' and '1'). It then iterates over all binary strings of length `n`, checking if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring within these binary strings. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. If the length of `s` is not within the specified range, the function prints an error message.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the program checks for all possible binary strings of length \( n \) and checks if \( s \) is a substring after all possible cyclical shifts of these strings. However, it does not ensure that each cyclical string is counted only once.

Consider the following input:
```
4
0000
```

The correct output should be 1 because there is only one distinct cyclical binary string "0000" that contains "0000" as a substring. However, the given program will incorrectly count multiple instances of "0000" due to the way it checks for cyclical shifts and substrings.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each cyclical string is considered uniquely. One way to do this is by converting the binary string to a set of its cyclical shifts and checking if \( s \) is a substring of any of these shifts. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = 0
    seen = set()
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        seen.add(t)
    for t in seen:
        for i in range(n):
            rotated_t = t[i:] + t[:i]
            if s in rotated_t:
                count += 1
                break
    print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each cyclical string is considered uniquely by storing all unique strings in a set and then checking if \( s \) is a substring of any of these unique strings.
