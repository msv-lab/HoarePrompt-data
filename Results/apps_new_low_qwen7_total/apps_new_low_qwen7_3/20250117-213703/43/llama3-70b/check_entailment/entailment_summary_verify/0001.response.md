Reasoning:

Let's revisit the program and verify it step-by-step against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \( n \) that contain a given binary string \( s \) as a substring.
   - A cyclical string \( t \) contains \( s \) if \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a brute-force approach by generating all possible binary strings of length \( n \).
   - It checks each generated binary string to see if it contains \( s \) as a substring under any cyclical shift.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The program generates all binary strings of length \( n \) using a loop with `range(2 ** n)`.
   - Each binary string \( t \) is generated using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`, which converts an integer \( i \) into a binary string of length \( n \).
   - The condition `all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)))` checks if \( s \) is a substring of \( t \) after any cyclical shift.
     - This is done by checking every possible starting position `i` within the string \( t \).
     - It checks both direct slices (`t[i:i + len(s)]`) and cyclical slices (`t[i + len(s):] + t[:i]`).

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the cyclical nature of the strings by checking all possible shifts.
   - The condition ensures that \( s \) is a substring of any cyclical shift of \( t \).
   - The program counts and prints the number of valid strings.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the cyclical check is implemented. Specifically, the condition `t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s` does not cover all possible cyclical shifts because it only checks one possible rotation at each starting position `i`. 

For instance, consider the string `t = "0101"` and `s = "01"`. The program would only check:
- Direct slice: `t[0:2] == "01"` (True)
- Cyclical shift: `t[2:] + t[:2] == "0101" + "01" == "010101"` (which is not equal to "01")

The correct way to check for all cyclical shifts would involve concatenating the string with itself and then checking for the substring `s`.

Here is the corrected approach:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Generate all binary strings of length n
    count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        # Concatenate the string with itself to handle cyclical shifts
        t_doubled = t * 2
        # Check if s is a substring of the doubled string
        if s in t_doubled:
            count += 1
    print(count)
```

Given this correction, the original program does not fully meet the requirement to check all cyclical shifts. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
