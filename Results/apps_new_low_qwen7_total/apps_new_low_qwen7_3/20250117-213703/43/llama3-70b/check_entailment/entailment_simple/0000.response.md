Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the input values `n` and `s` from standard input. This part is correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Loop and Condition Checking**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible binary strings of length `n` (from `0` to `2^n - 1`). This ensures that all possible binary strings of length `n` are checked.
   - For each integer `i`, the binary representation `t` is constructed and padded to ensure it has a length of `n`. This is done using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`, which is correct.
   - The condition checks whether `s` is a substring of `t` at any position `i` or if rotating `t` starting from position `i` results in `s` being a substring. This is a correct way to check for cyclical substrings.

3. **Count Increment**:
   - The variable `count` is incremented whenever the condition in the loop is satisfied. This correctly counts the number of valid cyclical strings.

4. **Output**:
   - The final count is printed, which is the required output as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain the string `s` as a substring.

Correctness: **True**
