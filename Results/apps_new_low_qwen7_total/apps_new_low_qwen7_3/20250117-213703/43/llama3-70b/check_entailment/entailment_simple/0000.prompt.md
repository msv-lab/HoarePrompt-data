Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.


-----Examples-----

Output
962


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and s is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n, where s contains only characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        
        if all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `i` is \(2^{n} - 1\), `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only characters '0' and '1', `t` is the binary representation of \(2^n - 1\) ('0b111...1') padded to length `n` with leading zeros, `count` is the total number of integers `i` from 0 to \(2^n - 1\) for which the condition \((\text{all}((t[i:i + len(s)] == s \text{ or } t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n))))\) holds true.
    #
    #### Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over all integers from 0 to \(2^n - 1\).
    #   - For each integer `i`, it converts `i` to a binary string `t` of length `n`.
    #   - It checks if there exists any position `i` within `t` such that the substring `t[i:i + len(s)]` equals `s` or if rotating `t` starting from `i` results in a substring equal to `s`.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - `i`: Starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches \(2^n - 1\).
    #   - `n`: Remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `s`: Remains constant throughout the loop.
    #   - `t`: Changes based on the current value of `i`.
    #   - `count`: Increments by 1 each time the condition in the loop is met.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will iterate exactly \(2^n\) times, as `i` ranges from 0 to \(2^n - 1\).
    #   - For each `i`, `t` is the binary representation of `i` padded to length `n`.
    #   - The loop counts the number of integers `i` for which the condition \((\text{all}((t[i:i + len(s)] == s \text{ or } t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n))))\) is true.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The loop will continue to increment `i` from 0 to \(2^n - 1\).
    #   - `t` will be updated accordingly in each iteration.
    #   - The condition checks if `s` appears as a substring or as a rotated substring in `t`.
    #
    #After the loop completes, `i` will be \(2^n - 1\), and `count` will be the total number of valid `i` values satisfying the condition.
    print(count)
