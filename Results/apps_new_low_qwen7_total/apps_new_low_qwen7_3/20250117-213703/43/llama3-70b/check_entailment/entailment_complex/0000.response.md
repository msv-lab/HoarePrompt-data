Reasoning:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length \(n\) that contain the given string \(s\) as a substring. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly reads the integer \(n\) and the string \(s\) from standard input.
   
2. **Loop Over All Possible Binary Strings**:
   - The loop iterates over all possible binary strings of length \(n\) using the integers from \(0\) to \(2^n - 1\). Each integer is converted to a binary string `t` of length \(n\) using `bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For each binary string `t`, the code checks if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring. This is done using the condition `all(t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))`. This condition ensures that for every possible starting position `i` in `t`, either the substring `t[i:i + len(s)]` matches `s` directly, or a rotation of `t` starting from `i` matches `s`.

4. **Counting Valid Strings**:
   - If the condition is satisfied for a given `t`, the counter `count` is incremented.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the total count of valid binary strings is printed.

Given that the logic accurately follows the problem statement and the provided comments correctly describe the flow and purpose of each part of the code, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
