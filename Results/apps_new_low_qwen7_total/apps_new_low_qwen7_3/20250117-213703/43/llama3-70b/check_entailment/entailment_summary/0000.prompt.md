Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given a binary string $s$.

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $n$ which contain $s$ as a substring.

The cyclical string $t$ contains $s$ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $t$, such that $s$ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $t$.

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 40$) — the length of the target string $t$.

The next line contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le n$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $t$. String $s$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $t$, which contain $s$ as a substring.

Output
962


-----Note-----

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = 0
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)
        if all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))):
            count += 1
    print(count)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and a string `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only '0' and '1'). It then iterates over all binary strings of length `n`, checking if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring within these binary strings. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. If the length of `s` is not within the specified range, the function prints an error message.
