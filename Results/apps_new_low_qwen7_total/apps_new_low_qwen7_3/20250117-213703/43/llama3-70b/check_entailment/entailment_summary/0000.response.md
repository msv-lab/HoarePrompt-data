Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly iterates through all possible binary strings of length `n` using a loop over the range `2 ** n`. This covers all combinations of binary strings of the given length.
2. For each binary string `t` generated, it checks whether `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring by using the condition `all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n)))`.
3. This condition is correctly implemented to check for both direct and rotated occurrences of `s` within `t`.
4. The program increments the counter `count` for each binary string that satisfies the condition.
5. Finally, it prints the count of such binary strings.

Given that the logic and the implementation appear to align with the problem description, the program should correctly compute the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length `n` that contain `s` as a substring.

Correctness: **True**
