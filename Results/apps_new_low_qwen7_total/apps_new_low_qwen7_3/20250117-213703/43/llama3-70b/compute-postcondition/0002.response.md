`i` is set to 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 40 (inclusive). The string `s` contains only '0' and '1' and its length is between 1 and `n`.

The code `t = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n)` does the following:
1. `bin(i)` converts `i` to its binary representation as a string, starting with '0b'. For `i = 0`, this results in '0b0'.
2. `[2:]` slices the string from index 2 onwards, resulting in '0' (the binary representation without '0b').
3. `.zfill(n)` pads the binary string with leading zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

Since `i` is 0, `bin(i)` is '0b0', and slicing it gives '0'. Padding this with zeros to a length of `n` results in a string of `n` zeros.

Therefore, `t` is now a string of `n` zeros, while `i` remains 0 and `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n, where `s` contains only characters '0' and '1'; `t` is a string of `n` zeros**
