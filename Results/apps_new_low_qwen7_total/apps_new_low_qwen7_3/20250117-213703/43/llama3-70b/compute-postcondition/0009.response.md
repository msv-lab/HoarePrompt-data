Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only characters '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` where the first character is '1' and the rest are '0's, `count` is either 1 or 2, and the condition \((\text{all}((t[i:i + len(s)] == s \text{ or } t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n))))\) is true.***

This postcondition accounts for both the if and else cases. If the if condition is satisfied, `count` becomes 2. If the if condition is not satisfied (though there is no else part), `count` remains 1, and the overall condition still holds true as per the given postcondition.
