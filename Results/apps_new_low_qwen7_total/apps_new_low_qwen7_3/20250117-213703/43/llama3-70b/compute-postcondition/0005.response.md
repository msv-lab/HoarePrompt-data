Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only characters '0' and '1', `t` is a string of `n` zeros, `count` is 1 more than its previous value, and the condition `(all((t[i:i + len(s)] == s or t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s for i in range(n))))` is true.**
