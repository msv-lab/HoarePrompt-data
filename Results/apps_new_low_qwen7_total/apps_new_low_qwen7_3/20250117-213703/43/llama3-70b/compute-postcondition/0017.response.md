Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 40) and a string `s` (where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only '0' and '1'). It then iterates over all binary strings of length `n`, checking if `s` appears as a substring or a rotated substring within these binary strings. The function counts how many such binary strings satisfy this condition and prints the count. If the length of `s` is not within the specified range, the function prints an error message.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the length of `s` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, the function will print an error message and not proceed further.
- The function correctly handles all binary strings of length `n` by considering all possible rotations and substrings of `s`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where `s` is an empty string explicitly. While the annotations mention that `s` should have a length between 1 and `n`, the code does not account for the case where `s` is empty. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if such a scenario is encountered.
