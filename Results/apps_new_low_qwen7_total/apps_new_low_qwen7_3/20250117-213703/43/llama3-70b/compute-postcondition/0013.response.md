Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, `s` is a string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ n and contains only characters '0' and '1', `t` is the binary representation of 2 ('0b10') padded to length `n` with leading zeros, `count` is either 2 or 3, and the condition \((\text{all}((t[i:i + len(s)] == s \text{ or } t[i + len(s):] + t[:i] == s \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n))))\) remains true.**
