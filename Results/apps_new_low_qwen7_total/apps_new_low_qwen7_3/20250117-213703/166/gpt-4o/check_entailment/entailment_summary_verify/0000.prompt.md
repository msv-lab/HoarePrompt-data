You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation. 


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2 1

Output
1


Input
1 0 0

Output
0


Input
1 1 1

Output
0


Input
1000000000000000000 0 1000000000000000000

Output
999999999999999999





-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

- Program:
def func():
    (b, d, s) = map(int, input().split())
    max_meals = max(b, d, s)
    missed_b = max(0, max_meals - 1 - b)
    missed_d = max(0, max_meals - 1 - d)
    missed_s = max(0, max_meals - 1 - s)
    total_missed_meals = missed_b + missed_d + missed_s
    print(total_missed_meals)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads three non-negative integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from the standard input, where each integer is between 0 and \(10^{18}\), and their sum is at least 1. It calculates the maximum number of meals (each meal requiring one unit of \(b\), \(d\), or \(s\)) that can be served based on the available resources. For each resource type, it computes the number of meals that could have been served but were missed due to insufficient resources. Finally, it prints the total number of missed meals. Potential edge cases include when one or more of the inputs are zero, which still allows for the calculation of missed meals. The function does not handle invalid input types or values outside the specified range.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where Vasiliy might have missed meals due to arriving or leaving on the same day. Specifically, the program assumes that Vasiliy could have missed up to `max_meals - 1` meals for each meal type (breakfast, dinner, supper), but it does not account for the possibility that he might have missed fewer meals if he arrived or left on the same day.

For example, consider the input `1 0 0`. According to the problem description, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast and left after breakfast on the same day, missing no meals. However, the program incorrectly calculates the missed meals as follows:

- `missed_b = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 1) = 0`
- `missed_d = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 0) = 0`
- `missed_s = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 0) = 0`

The total missed meals are `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which is correct in this specific case. However, the program fails to handle other scenarios correctly. For instance, in the input `3 2 1`, the program calculates the missed meals as follows:

- `missed_b = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 3) = 1`
- `missed_d = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 2) = 0`
- `missed_s = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 1) = 0`

The total missed meals are `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`, which is also correct in this specific case. However, the program does not consider the possibility that Vasiliy might have missed fewer meals if he arrived or left on the same day, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the constraints related to the arrival and departure times more carefully.
