Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where Vasiliy might have missed meals due to arriving or leaving on the same day. Specifically, the program assumes that Vasiliy could have missed up to `max_meals - 1` meals for each meal type (breakfast, dinner, supper), but it does not account for the possibility that he might have missed fewer meals if he arrived or left on the same day.

For example, consider the input `1 0 0`. According to the problem description, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast and left after breakfast on the same day, missing no meals. However, the program incorrectly calculates the missed meals as follows:

- `missed_b = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 1) = 0`
- `missed_d = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 0) = 0`
- `missed_s = max(0, max(1, 0, 0) - 1 - 0) = 0`

The total missed meals are `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which is correct in this specific case. However, the program fails to handle other scenarios correctly. For instance, in the input `3 2 1`, the program calculates the missed meals as follows:

- `missed_b = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 3) = 1`
- `missed_d = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 2) = 0`
- `missed_s = max(0, max(3, 2, 1) - 1 - 1) = 0`

The total missed meals are `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`, which is also correct in this specific case. However, the program does not consider the possibility that Vasiliy might have missed fewer meals if he arrived or left on the same day, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the constraints related to the arrival and departure times more carefully.
