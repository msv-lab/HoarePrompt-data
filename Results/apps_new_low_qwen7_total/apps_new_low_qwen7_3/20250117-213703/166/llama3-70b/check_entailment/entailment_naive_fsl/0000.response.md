Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed. For instance, consider the input `1 1 1`. According to the problem description, if Vasiliy had 1 breakfast, 1 dinner, and 1 supper, he did not miss any meals regardless of his arrival and departure times. However, the program outputs `0`, which is correct in this case. But let's consider another input `3 2 1`. The program calculates the maximum of `b - d`, `b - s`, and `d - s` and prints it. In this case, it prints `1`, which is correct because Vasiliy could have missed one supper. However, the program does not handle the case where Vasiliy might have arrived before breakfast and left after supper on the same day, missing no meals at all. 

To illustrate, if Vasiliy had 3 breakfasts, 2 dinners, and 1 supper, he could have arrived before breakfast and left after supper on the same day, missing no meals. The program should output `0` in this scenario, but it outputs `1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence is incorrect.
