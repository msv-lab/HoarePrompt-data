You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation. 


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2 1

Output
1


Input
1 0 0

Output
0


Input
1 1 1

Output
0


Input
1000000000000000000 0 1000000000000000000

Output
999999999999999999





-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

- Program: 
def func():
    (b, d, s) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, d, and s are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.
def func():
    b, d, s = map(int, input().split())

print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed. For instance, consider the input `1 1 1`. According to the problem description, if Vasiliy had 1 breakfast, 1 dinner, and 1 supper, he did not miss any meals regardless of his arrival and departure times. However, the program outputs `0`, which is correct in this case. But let's consider another input `3 2 1`. The program calculates the maximum of `b - d`, `b - s`, and `d - s` and prints it. In this case, it prints `1`, which is correct because Vasiliy could have missed one supper. However, the program does not handle the case where Vasiliy might have arrived before breakfast and left after supper on the same day, missing no meals at all. 

To illustrate, if Vasiliy had 3 breakfasts, 2 dinners, and 1 supper, he could have arrived before breakfast and left after supper on the same day, missing no meals. The program should output `0` in this scenario, but it outputs `1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence is incorrect.
