Reasoning:

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of meals Vasiliy could have missed during his stay in the sanatorium. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from the standard input, ensuring they satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\).

2. **Calculation Logic**: The program calculates the maximum value among the following differences:
   - \(b - d\): This represents the number of breakfasts more than dinners.
   - \(b - s\): This represents the number of breakfasts more than suppers.
   - \(d - s\): This represents the number of dinners more than suppers.

3. **Interpretation of Differences**:
   - If \(b - d > 0\), it means there were more breakfasts than dinners, indicating some dinners might be missed.
   - If \(b - s > 0\), it means there were more breakfasts than suppers, indicating some suppers might be missed.
   - If \(d - s > 0\), it means there were more dinners than suppers, indicating some suppers might be missed.

4. **Minimum Missed Meals**: The maximum of these differences will give the minimum number of meals that could have been missed. If a difference is negative, it means there were more dinners/suppers than breakfasts, so those cases are not considered in the maximum calculation.

5. **Output**: The program returns the calculated maximum difference, which corresponds to the minimum number of meals missed.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program accurately computes the minimum number of missed meals. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
