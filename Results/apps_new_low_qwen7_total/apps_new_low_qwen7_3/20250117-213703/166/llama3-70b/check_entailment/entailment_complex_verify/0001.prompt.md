You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he completely forgot details of his vacation! 

Every day there was a breakfast, a dinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this order). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.

Vasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.

According to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as missed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the departure day after he left.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. 

In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal.

In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.

- Program: 
def func():
    (b, d, s) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, d, and s are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18 and b + d + s ≥ 1.
def func():
    b, d, s = map(int, input().split())

print(max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three non-negative integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from standard input, ensuring they satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\). It then returns the maximum value among \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\). If any of these differences result in a negative number, it is treated as zero. Notably, the function does not modify any of the input values; it only computes and returns the maximum difference.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Vasiliy needs to determine the minimum number of meals he could have missed.
   - A meal is considered missed if it occurred outside the period he was in the sanatorium.
   - He can arrive at different times relative to the meals (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper, or after supper).

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The code reads three integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) representing the number of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers respectively.
   - It calculates the maximum value among `b - d`, `b - s`, and `d - s` and prints the result.
   - The formula `max(0, b - d, b - s, d - s)` attempts to find the maximum difference between the counts of each meal type.

3. **Calculation Explanation**:
   - `b - d`: This represents the excess number of breakfasts over dinners.
     - If Vasiliy arrived before breakfast, he could miss up to \(b - d\) dinners.
   - `b - s`: This represents the excess number of breakfasts over suppers.
     - If Vasiliy arrived before breakfast, he could miss up to \(b - s\) suppers.
   - `d - s`: This represents the excess number of dinners over suppers.
     - If Vasiliy arrived before dinner, he could miss up to \(d - s\) suppers.

4. **Minimum Missed Meals**:
   - The `max(0, ...)` ensures that the result is non-negative (since a negative value indicates no excess and thus no missed meals).
   - By taking the maximum of these differences, we ensure we account for the worst-case scenario where the excess of one meal type would be offset by the deficit in another meal type.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(b \geq d \geq s\), then \(b - d\) and \(b - s\) might be positive, but \(d - s\) would be zero.
   - If \(d \geq b \geq s\), then \(d - s\) might be positive, but \(b - d\) and \(b - s\) would be zero.
   - If \(s \geq b \geq d\), then \(s - d\) might be positive, but \(b - d\) and \(b - s\) would be zero.
   - The function correctly handles these cases by calculating the maximum possible missed meals.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be logically sound and correctly addresses the problem requirements.
