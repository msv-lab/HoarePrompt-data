Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from standard input, ensuring they satisfy the conditions \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\). It then returns the maximum value among \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\). If any of these differences result in a negative number, it is treated as zero. Notably, the function does not modify any of the input values; it only computes and returns the maximum difference.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function as described by the code and addresses the given postconditions and potential edge cases.
