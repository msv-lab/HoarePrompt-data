The code snippet reads three non-negative integers \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) from the standard input and then prints the maximum value among \(0\), \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\). After reading the inputs, the values of \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) are updated to the input values, and the maximum of the specified expressions is printed.

Given the initial state where \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq b, d, s \leq 10^{18}\) and \(b + d + s \geq 1\), the code will read new values for \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) and compute the maximum of \(0\), \(b - d\), \(b - s\), and \(d - s\).

Since the exact input values are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values of \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\) after the input. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the new values of \(b\), \(d\), and \(s\), and the computed value of the expression.

Final Output State: **b is the input value of b, d is the input value of d, s is the input value of s, and the printed output is the maximum value among 0, b - d, b - s, and d - s**.
