### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find four points on a grid such that the polyline formed by these points is as long as possible. The points must be distinct and lie within the grid defined by \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, m)` to generate a list of four points.
   - Finally, it prints these four points.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it selects the four corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If \(n\) is 0, it selects points along the y-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
   - If \(m\) is 0, it selects points along the x-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
   - If \(n\) is 1, it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., when \(m = 1\)), it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\): The selected points cover the vertical axis, ensuring the maximum possible distance between points.
   - For \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\): The selected points cover the horizontal axis, again ensuring the maximum possible distance.
   - For small values of \(n\) or \(m\), the function ensures that the points are chosen to maximize the polyline length by focusing on the available dimensions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Let's analyze each case in detail:
     - **Case 1: \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\)**:
       - Points: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
       - This configuration covers the maximum distance in both the x and y directions.
     - **Case 2: \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\)**:
       - Points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
       - These points ensure the maximum distance along the y-axis.
     - **Case 3: \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\)**:
       - Points: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
       - These points ensure the maximum distance along the x-axis.
     - **Case 4: \(n = 1\) and \(m \geq 2\)**:
       - Points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
       - This configuration maximizes the distance in both the x and y directions.
     - **Case 5: \(m = 1\) and \(n \geq 2\)**:
       - Points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).
       - This configuration maximizes the distance in both the x and y directions.
     - **Case 6: \(n = 0\) and \(m = 0\)**:
       - This case is not possible since the grid must contain at least 4 different points.

6. **Validation with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly reflect the state of the program at various points and confirm that the function `func_1` generates the optimal set of points for each case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all possible grid sizes and ensures the selection of points to form the longest possible polyline. The function `func_1` is well-structured and accounts for all edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
