You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find four points on a grid such that the polyline formed by these points is as long as possible. The points must be distinct and lie within the grid defined by \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, m)` to generate a list of four points.
   - Finally, it prints these four points.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it selects the four corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If \(n\) is 0, it selects points along the y-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
   - If \(m\) is 0, it selects points along the x-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
   - If \(n\) is 1, it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., when \(m = 1\)), it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\): The selected points cover the vertical axis, ensuring the maximum possible distance between points.
   - For \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\): The selected points cover the horizontal axis, again ensuring the maximum possible distance.
   - For small values of \(n\) or \(m\), the function ensures that the points are chosen to maximize the polyline length by focusing on the available dimensions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and generates the longest possible polyline for the given constraints.
   - The polyline length is maximized by choosing the most distant points available within the grid.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct as it handles all possible grid sizes and ensures the selection of points to form the longest possible polyline.

### Correctness:
**True**
