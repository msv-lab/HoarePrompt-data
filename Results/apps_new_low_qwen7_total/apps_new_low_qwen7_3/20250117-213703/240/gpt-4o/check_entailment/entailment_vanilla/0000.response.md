### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find four points on a grid such that the polyline formed by these points is as long as possible. The points must be distinct and lie within the grid defined by \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, m)` to generate a list of four points.
   - Finally, it prints these four points.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it selects the four corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If \(n\) is 0, it selects points along the y-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
   - If \(m\) is 0, it selects points along the x-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
   - If \(n\) is 1, it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
   - If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., when \(m = 1\)), it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\): The selected points cover the vertical axis, ensuring the maximum possible distance between points.
   - For \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\): The selected points cover the horizontal axis, again ensuring the maximum possible distance.
   - For small values of \(n\) or \(m\), the function ensures that the points are chosen to maximize the polyline length by focusing on the available dimensions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and generates the longest possible polyline for the given constraints.
   - The polyline length is maximized by choosing the most distant points available within the grid.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct as it handles all possible grid sizes and ensures the selection of points to form the longest possible polyline.

### Correctness:
**True**
