Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate the longest possible polyline in all cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 1, which is one of the given examples. According to the problem description, for the input `(1, 1)`, the expected output is:

```
1 1
0 0
1 0
0 1
```

However, the program generates:

```
1 1
0 0
0 1
0 0
```

This is incorrect because it does not form a valid polyline with the required points. The program needs to ensure that the points it selects form a polyline that maximizes the total length, which is not guaranteed in its current form. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
