### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find four points on a grid such that the polyline formed by these points is as long as possible. The points must be distinct and lie within the grid defined by \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, m)` to generate a list of four points.
   - Finally, it prints these four points.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks various conditions to determine which four points to select:
     - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it selects the four corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - If \(n\) is 0, it selects points along the y-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
     - If \(m\) is 0, it selects points along the x-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
     - If \(n\) is 1, it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - Otherwise, it selects points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\), the selected points are \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\). These points are along the y-axis and cover the maximum possible distance vertically.
   - For \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\), the selected points are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\). These points are along the x-axis and cover the maximum possible distance horizontally.
   - For \(n = 1\), the selected points are \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\). These points form a vertical and horizontal line segment, maximizing the distance.
   - For other small values of \(n\) or \(m\), the function ensures that the points are chosen to maximize the polyline length by focusing on the available dimensions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and generates the longest possible polyline for the given constraints.
   - The polyline length is maximized by choosing the most distant points available within the grid.

### Annotations Evaluation:
- The annotations provided in the code match the logic and flow of the program.
- The function `func_1` is structured to handle all possible cases and ensures that the selected points form the longest possible polyline.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the four points that form the longest possible polyline. The function handles all edge cases and ensures the selection of points to maximize the polyline length.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
