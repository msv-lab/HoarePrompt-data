### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Given a grid from (0, 0) to (n, m).
- Need to select 4 different points to form the longest possible polyline.
- The polyline should consist of the line segments connecting these points.

#### Input and Output
- The input is two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- The output should be 4 lines with two integers each, representing the coordinates of the points in order.

#### Key Points
1. **Points Selection**: The program should select 4 points that maximize the total length of the polyline.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( n \geq 2 \) and \( m \geq 2 \): The points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\) form a valid polyline.
   - When \( n = 0 \): The points \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\) form a valid polyline.
   - When \( m = 0 \): The points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\) form a valid polyline.
   - When \( n = 1 \): The points \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\) form a valid polyline.
   - When \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \): The points \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), \((0, 1)\) form a valid polyline.

#### Analysis of Provided Function `func_1`
- The function correctly handles all the specified edge cases and generates a set of points that form a valid polyline.
- For the specific case of \( (1, 1) \):
  - The function returns \([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\), which forms the desired polyline.

#### Validity of the Original Assessment
- The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where both \( n \) and \( m \) are 1.
- However, the function correctly handles this case and returns the correct set of points.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was overly critical and did not account for the fact that the function correctly handles all specified edge cases and the example given.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it handles all the specified edge cases and forms the longest possible polyline for any valid input.
