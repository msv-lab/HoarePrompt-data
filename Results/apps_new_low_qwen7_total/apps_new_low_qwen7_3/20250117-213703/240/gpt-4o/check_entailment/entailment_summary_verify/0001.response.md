### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find four points on a grid such that the polyline formed by these points is as long as possible. The points must be distinct and lie within the grid defined by \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program first reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, m)` to generate a list of four points.
   - Finally, it prints these four points.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` handles various edge cases:
     - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it returns the four corners of the grid: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - If \(n\) is 0, it returns points along the y-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\).
     - If \(m\) is 0, it returns points along the x-axis: \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\).
     - If \(n\) is 1, it returns points: \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), \((0, m)\).
     - Otherwise, it returns points: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), \((n, 0)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 0\) and \(m \geq 2\): The selected points \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, m-1)\) indeed maximize the polyline length along the y-axis.
   - For \(m = 0\) and \(n \geq 2\): The selected points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((n-1, 0)\) indeed maximize the polyline length along the x-axis.
   - For small values of \(n\) or \(m\), the function ensures that the points are chosen to maximize the polyline length by focusing on the available dimensions.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and generates the longest possible polyline for the given constraints.
   - The polyline length is maximized by choosing the most distant points available within the grid.

6. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples and the logic within `func_1` align with the requirement to maximize the polyline length.
   - The program does not need any additional checks beyond what is covered by the function `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to select the longest possible polyline for the given grid dimensions. The function `func_1` covers all necessary edge cases and ensures that the selected points form the longest possible polyline.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
