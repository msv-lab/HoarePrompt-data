You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from (0, 0) to (n, m) inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.

A polyline defined by points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 consists of the line segments p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, p_3 p_4, and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.


-----Output-----

Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline.

Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
1 1
0 0
1 0
0 1

Input
0 10

Output
0 1
0 10
0 0
0 9

- Program:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, m)
for point in result:
    print(point[0], point[1])

def func_1(n, m):
    if n >= 2 and m >= 2:
        points = [(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)]
    elif n == 0:
        points = [(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]
    elif m == 0:
        points = [(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]
    elif n == 1:
        points = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]
    else:
        points = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]
    return points



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\). It returns a list of four distinct points based on the values of `n` and `m`. The function handles various edge cases:
- If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, it returns the points \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)\].
- If `n` is 0, it returns \[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)].
- If `m` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, it returns \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)].
- If `n` is 1, it returns \[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)].
- Otherwise, it returns \[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)].

The function ensures that the grid contains at least 4 different points and the returned list always consists of four distinct points.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate the longest possible polyline in all cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case where both `n` and `m` are 1, which is one of the given examples. According to the problem description, for the input `(1, 1)`, the expected output is:

```
1 1
0 0
1 0
0 1
```

However, the program generates:

```
1 1
0 0
0 1
0 0
```

This is incorrect because it does not form a valid polyline with the required points. The program needs to ensure that the points it selects form a polyline that maximizes the total length, which is not guaranteed in its current form. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
