### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly handles all cases and forms the longest possible polyline.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of four points based on the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It handles several specific cases:
     - If both \( n \) and \( m \) are at least 2, it returns the points \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
     - If \( n \) is 0, it returns \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, m - 1)\).
     - If \( m \) is 0 and \( n \) is at least 2, it returns \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((n - 1, 0)\).
     - If \( n \) is 1, it returns \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), and \((n, 0)\).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example \((1, 1)\), the function returns \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\), which indeed forms a polyline with the maximum possible length for this grid (4 units).
   - For the example \((0, 10)\), the function returns \((0, 0)\), \((0, 10)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, 9)\), which is correct.
   - For the example \((10, 0)\), the function returns \((0, 0)\), \((10, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((9, 0)\), which is also correct.

4. **General Case Analysis**:
   - In all cases, the function ensures that the selected points form a valid polyline and that the points are distinct.
   - The function also ensures that the points are chosen in such a way that they maximize the total length of the polyline by selecting the extreme points in the grid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, including when \( n \) or \( m \) is 0 or 1.
   - The function always returns four distinct points that form a valid polyline.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly handles all cases and forms the longest possible polyline in each scenario. The original assessment incorrectly identified an issue with the case \((1, 1)\), but upon closer inspection, the program actually provides the correct output for this case.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
