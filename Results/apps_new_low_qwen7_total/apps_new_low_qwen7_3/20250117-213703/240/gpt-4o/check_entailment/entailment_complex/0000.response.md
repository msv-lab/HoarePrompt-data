### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and assigned to `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to select four points from the grid such that the resulting polyline is as long as possible.
   - Based on the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`), the function constructs a set of points to form the longest possible polyline:
     - If both `n` and `m` are at least 2, the points are chosen to span the entire width and height, forming a "cross" shape: \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)\].
     - If `n` is 0, the points are chosen along the y-axis: \[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)].
     - If `m` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, the points are chosen along the x-axis: \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)].
     - If `n` is 1, the points are chosen to form a vertical line: \[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)].
     - Otherwise, the points are chosen to form a horizontal line: \[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)].
   - These choices ensure that the polyline is as long as possible by maximizing the Euclidean distance between consecutive points.

3. **Output Handling**: The function returns the list of points, which is then printed in the main program.

Given these points, let's check if the solution meets the requirements:
- The function correctly handles all edge cases where the grid dimensions are zero or very small.
- The points chosen ensure the longest possible polyline for any valid grid dimensions.
- The solution ensures that the grid contains at least 4 different points, and the points are distinct.

Since the logic in the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the longest possible polyline by selecting four distinct points, the given solution is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
