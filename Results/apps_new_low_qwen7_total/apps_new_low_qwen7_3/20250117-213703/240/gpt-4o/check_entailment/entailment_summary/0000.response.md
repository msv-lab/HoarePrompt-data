Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the longest possible polyline by choosing four points on a grid from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, m)\). The function `func_1` handles various cases based on the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid. Let's analyze each case:

1. **Case \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\)**: 
   - The points chosen are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - The polyline will span the entire width and height of the grid, maximizing the length.

2. **Case \(n = 0\)**:
   - The points chosen are \((0, 0)\), \((0, m)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, m - 1)\).
   - Since \(n = 0\), this effectively reduces the grid to a single vertical line segment, but it still satisfies the requirement of having 4 points.

3. **Case \(m = 0\)**:
   - The points chosen are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((n - 1, 0)\).
   - Since \(m = 0\), this effectively reduces the grid to a single horizontal line segment, but it still satisfies the requirement of having 4 points.

4. **Case \(n = 1\)**:
   - The points chosen are \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, m)\), and \((0, m)\).
   - This configuration ensures that the grid is utilized in the best way possible while maintaining the requirement of 4 distinct points.

5. **Otherwise**: 
   - The points chosen are \((0, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((n, 1)\), and \((n, 0)\).
   - This is a fallback configuration that ensures there are 4 points and covers a significant part of the grid.

Given the execution summary and the analysis of the function `func_1`, the program correctly identifies the points to form the longest possible polyline for any valid input \((n, m)\). Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
