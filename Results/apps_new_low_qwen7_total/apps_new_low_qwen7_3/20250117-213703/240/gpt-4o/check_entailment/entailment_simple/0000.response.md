Reasoning:

1. The problem requires choosing 4 points on a grid from (0,0) to (n,m) to form the longest possible polyline. The length of the polyline is determined by the sum of the lengths of the line segments connecting these points.

2. The annotated program correctly handles the edge cases where either \(n\) or \(m\) is less than 2:
   - If both \(n\) and \(m\) are at least 2, it selects points \((0,0)\), \((n,0)\), \((n,m)\), and \((0,m)\).
   - If \(n\) is 0, it selects points \((0,0)\), \((0,m)\), \((0,1)\), and \((0,m-1)\).
   - If \(m\) is 0, it selects points \((0,0)\), \((n,0)\), \((1,0)\), and \((n-1,0)\).
   - If \(n\) is 1, it selects points \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((1,m)\), and \((0,m)\).
   - If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., \(n=0\) and \(m<2\) or \(m=0\) and \(n<2\)), it selects points that still ensure the formation of a polyline.

3. The selected points in each case form a straight line, which means the polyline is as long as possible given the constraints (it covers the maximum distance between points).

4. The function `func_1` returns a list of these 4 points in order, which matches the requirements of the problem statement.

5. The annotated program correctly reflects the logic and the state of the program at each step.

Given that the logic for selecting the points is correct and ensures the longest possible polyline, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
