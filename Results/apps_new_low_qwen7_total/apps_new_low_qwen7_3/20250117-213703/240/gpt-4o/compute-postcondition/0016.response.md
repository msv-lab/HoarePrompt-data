Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), and the grid contains at least 4 different points. After executing the if-else block, the `points` list will be defined as follows:
- If `n >= 2` and `m >= 2`, then `points` is a list containing the elements \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)\].
- If `n == 0`, then `points` is \[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)].
- If `m == 0` and `n >= 2`, then `points` is \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)].
- If `n == 1`, then `points` is \[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)].
- Otherwise, `points` is \[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]**.
