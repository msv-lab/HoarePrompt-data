Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), and the grid contains at least 4 different points. If `n == 0`, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`. If \(n \geq 2\) and \(m \geq 2\), then `points` is a list containing four distinct points: 
- If `m == 0`, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`.
- If `n == 1`, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`.
- Otherwise, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.***
