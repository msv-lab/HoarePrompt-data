The code initializes the list `points` with four tuples representing coordinates: `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(1, m)`, and `(0, m)`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. The value of `n` remains 1, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1000\) and \(m \geq 2\).

Output State: **`n` is 1; `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 1000\) and \(m \geq 2\); `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`**
