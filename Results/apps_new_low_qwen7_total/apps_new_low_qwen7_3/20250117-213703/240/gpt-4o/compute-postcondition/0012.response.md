The code creates a list called `points` and assigns it with four tuples representing coordinates. These points are specifically the corners of a rectangle with width `n` and height 1, and the top-left corner at `(0, 0)`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers within the range `[0, 1000]` and are at least 2.
- The grid contains at least 4 different points.
- `n` is not equal to 1.

The code does not affect the values of `n` or `m`. It only initializes the `points` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state regarding `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 1000 and `n` >= 2; `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `m` <= 1000 and `m` >= 2; `n` is not equal to 1; `points` is a list containing the elements [(0, 0), (0, 1), (`n`, 1), (`n`, 0)]**
