The code creates a list named `points` containing four tuples representing points in a coordinate system. The points are explicitly defined as `(0, 0)`, `(0, m)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(0, m - 1)`. The variables `n` and `m` retain their initial states, and no changes are made to them within the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= 1000, and either n < 2 or m < 2, and the grid contains at least 4 different points; `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, m), (0, 1), (0, m - 1)]`**
