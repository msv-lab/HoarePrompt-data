The code initializes the list `points` with four tuples representing coordinates. Specifically, the points are \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), \((n, m)\), and \((0, m)\). No other variables are defined or modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 1000, the grid contains at least 4 different points, and both n and m are greater than or equal to 2; `points` is a list containing the elements \[(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)\]**
