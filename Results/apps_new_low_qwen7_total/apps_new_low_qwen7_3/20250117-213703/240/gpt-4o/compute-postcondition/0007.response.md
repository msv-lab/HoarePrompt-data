The code initializes the `points` list with four tuples, each representing a point in a 2D grid. The first two points are `(0, 0)` and `(n, 0)`, the third point is `(1, 0)`, and the fourth point is `(n - 1, 0)`. 

- The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged and is 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 1000 and `n` >= 2, `m` is 0, and the grid now contains the points [(0, 0), (`n`, 0), (1, 0), (`n` - 1, 0)].**
