Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1000\) and \(n, m \geq 2\). `points` is a list containing four distinct points. If `m == 0`, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (n, 0), (1, 0), (n - 1, 0)]`. Otherwise, if `n == 1`, then `points` is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, m), (0, m)]`. Otherwise, `points` is `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (n, 1), (n, 0)]`.**
