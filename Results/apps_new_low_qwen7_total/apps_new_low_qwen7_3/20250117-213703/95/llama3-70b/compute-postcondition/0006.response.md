First, let's break down the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is a non-empty string.
- `x` is calculated as `int(c) + int(c) * n`, where `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`.
- `i` is 2.
- `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`.

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```python
x += int(c) * n ** i
```
This line updates the value of `x`. Specifically, it adds `int(c) * n ** i` to the current value of `x`.

Since `i` is 2, `n ** i` is `n ** 2`. Therefore, the expression being added to `x` is `int(c) * n ** 2`.

Let's summarize the updated state:
- `n` remains unchanged, so \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `k` remains unchanged, so it is still a non-empty string.
- `x` is now `x + int(c) * n ** 2`.
- `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still 2.
- `c` remains unchanged, so `c` is still the third character of the reversed string `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is `x + int(c) * n ** 2`, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`**.
