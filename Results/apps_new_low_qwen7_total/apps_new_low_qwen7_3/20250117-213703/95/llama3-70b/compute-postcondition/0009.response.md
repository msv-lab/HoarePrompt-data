The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system, where all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and `k` contains no more than 60 symbols. The function does not return an error message in this snippet but rather processes the input and returns a value based on the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `k` and process them according to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and a string `k` representing a number in a base-n numeral system, and returns a value based on the given constraints.**
