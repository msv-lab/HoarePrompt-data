Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
   - `k` is a non-empty string
   - `x` is `int(c)`
   - `i` is 0
   - `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters of the reversed string `k` using `enumerate`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `c` is the character at the current position in the reversed string.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `c` will then be the second character of the reversed string `k`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `x` remains the same as it is derived from `c` and does not change unless `c` changes.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `c` becomes the second character of the reversed string `k`.

7. **Final State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
   - `k` is a non-empty string
   - `x` is `int(c)` where `c` is now the second character of the reversed string `k`
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`

**Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is `int(c)` where `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`, `i` is 1, and `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`**
