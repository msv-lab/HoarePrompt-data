The provided code reads two inputs, `n` and `k`, and initializes a variable `x` to 0. However, the code does not perform any operations on these variables. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` are set by the inputs, and `x` remains 0.

Given the precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `k` is a string representing a number in a base-`n` numeral system, where all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and `k` contains no more than 60 symbols, the values of `n` and `k` are determined by the user input.

Since no operations are performed on `x`, it remains 0. 

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system, where all digits in k are strictly less than n and k contains no more than 60 symbols, x is 0**
