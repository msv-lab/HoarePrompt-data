Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `(i, c)` where `i` is the index and `c` is the character from the reversed string `k`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
   - `k` is a non-empty string
   - `x` is `int(c) + int(c) * n`
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if there are more characters in the reversed string `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning it processed the second character (`c`) of the reversed string `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - The new value of `c` will be the third character of the reversed string `k`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` remains the same: an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `k` remains the same: a non-empty string
- `x` remains the same: `int(c) + int(c) * n` (where `c` is now the third character of the reversed string `k`)
- `i` will be 2
- `c` will be the third character of the reversed string `k`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is `int(c) + int(c) * n` where `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`**.

In a concise format:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is `int(c) + int(c) * n` where `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`**.
