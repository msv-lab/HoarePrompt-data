Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
   - `k` is a non-empty string
   - `x` is `int(c)` where `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`

2. Code Execution: 
   - `x += int(c) * n ** i`
     - Here, `x` is updated by adding `int(c) * n ** i` to its current value.
     - Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `x += int(c) * n`.

3. After the code executes, the new value of `x` is the original value of `x` plus `int(c) * n`.
   - The original value of `x` was `int(c)`, and now it is `int(c) + int(c) * n`.

4. Variables not affected by the code: `n`, `k`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a non-empty string; `x` is `int(c) + int(c) * n`; `i` is 1; `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`**
