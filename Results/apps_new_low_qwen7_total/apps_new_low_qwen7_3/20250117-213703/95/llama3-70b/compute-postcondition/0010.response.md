Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` representing a number in a base-n numeral system. It then converts `k` from the specified base `n` to its decimal (base-10) representation and prints the resulting integer `x`. The function ensures that all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and that `k` contains no more than 60 symbols. If `k` is empty or any digit in `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function will not behave as expected and may result in incorrect output.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is an empty string, the function will print `0`.
- If any digit in `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function will not correctly interpret `k` as a valid base-n number and may produce incorrect results.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate whether `k` is a valid base-n number (i.e., all digits are less than `n`). This validation is necessary to ensure the correct conversion. If `k` contains invalid digits, the function should either raise an error or handle the situation appropriately.
