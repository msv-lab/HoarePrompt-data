Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system, where all digits in k are strictly less than n and k contains no more than 60 symbols, x is 0
Code of the loop:
for i, c in enumerate(reversed(k)):
    x += int(c) * n ** i


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is int(c), `i` is 0, and `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a non-empty string; `x` is `int(c) + int(c) * n`; `i` is 1; `c` is the second character of the reversed string `k`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: First, let's break down the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is a non-empty string.
- `x` is calculated as `int(c) + int(c) * n`, where `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`.
- `i` is 2.
- `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`.

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```python
x += int(c) * n ** i
```
This line updates the value of `x`. Specifically, it adds `int(c) * n ** i` to the current value of `x`.

Since `i` is 2, `n ** i` is `n ** 2`. Therefore, the expression being added to `x` is `int(c) * n ** 2`.

Let's summarize the updated state:
- `n` remains unchanged, so \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `k` remains unchanged, so it is still a non-empty string.
- `x` is now `x + int(c) * n ** 2`.
- `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still 2.
- `c` remains unchanged, so `c` is still the third character of the reversed string `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is `x + int(c) * n ** 2`, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character of the reversed string `k`**.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
