Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` in the reversed string `k` and corresponding index `i`, `i` is the length of the reversed string `k` minus one, and `c` is the last character of the reversed string `k` if the loop has executed its full course.** 

To verify this:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `k`, updating `x` by adding `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` and its index `i`.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `n` remains constant.
   - `k` remains constant.
   - `x` accumulates the sum of `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` and index `i`.
   - `i` increases with each iteration until it equals the length of the reversed string `k` minus one.
   - `c` is the character at the current index `i` in the reversed string `k`.
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: The loop will execute once for each character in the reversed string `k`. The value of `x` is the base-n interpretation of the string `k`. The final value of `i` will be the length of the reversed string `k` minus one, and `c` will be the last character of the reversed string `k`.
4. **Verify Relationships**: The final value of `x` is indeed the sum of `int(c) * n ** i` for each character `c` in the reversed string `k` and its corresponding index `i`. This is consistent with the behavior of converting a number from base-n to decimal.
