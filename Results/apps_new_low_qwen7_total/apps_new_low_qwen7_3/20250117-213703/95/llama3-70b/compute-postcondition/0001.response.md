To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `k` is a string representing a number in a base-\(n\) numeral system, where all digits in \(k\) are strictly less than \(n\) and \(k\) contains no more than 60 symbols.
   - `x` is 0.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the reversed string `k` using `enumerate()`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `c` at each position.
   - For the loop to execute, the reversed string `k` must contain at least one character. This means the original string `k` must contain at least one character when reversed.

4. **Conditions for the First Iteration:**
   - The loop will start iterating as soon as the reversed string `k` has at least one character.
   - Therefore, `k` must not be an empty string.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Since the loop uses `enumerate(reversed(k))`, the index `i` will start from 0 and increase by 1 in each iteration.
   - The character `c` will be the first character of the reversed string `k` in the first iteration.

Given the above analysis, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time are:

- The string `k` must contain at least one character.
- The index `i` must be 0.
- The character `c` must be the first character of the reversed string `k`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is 0, `i` is 0, and `c` is the first character of the reversed string `k`**.
