The code `print(x)` prints the value of `x`, which is already defined as the sum of `int(c) * n` for each character `c` in the string `k`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but `x` is printed.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\),
- `k` is a non-empty string,
- `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n` for each character `c` in the string `k`.

The code does not modify `n` or `k`, but it prints `x`. Since the exact value of `x` depends on the characters in `k` and the value of `n`, we cannot specify `x` without knowing the specific characters in `k`. However, we know `x` is computed as described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n` for each character `c` in the string `k`, and the value of `x` is printed.**
