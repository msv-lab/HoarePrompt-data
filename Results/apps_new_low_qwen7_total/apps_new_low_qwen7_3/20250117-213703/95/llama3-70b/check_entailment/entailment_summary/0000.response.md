Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to convert a number from a given base `n` to its decimal (base-10) representation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two inputs - an integer `n` and a string `k`. 
2. **Conversion Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over each character in the reversed string `k`.
   - For each character, it multiplies the character's integer value by `n` raised to the power of the current index (after reversing).
   - This process effectively reconstructs the original decimal number from the base-n representation.
3. **Output**: The resulting integer `x` is printed, which is the decimal representation of the input number `k` in base `n`.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the provided solution meets all requirements:
- It handles the input within the specified limits.
- It correctly converts the number from the given base to decimal.
- It avoids issues with leading zeros and digits being less than `n`.

Since the program logic is sound and matches the problem requirements, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
