Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the base `n` and the number `k` in the specified format.
2. **Reversing the String**: The program reverses the string `k` before iterating over it. This ensures that each digit is processed from the least significant to the most significant position, which is necessary for correct conversion.
3. **Loop through Digits**: The loop iterates through each character of the reversed string `k`, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (which is correctly calculated as `i`).
4. **Accumulation**: The result `x` accumulates the converted value as the loop progresses, ensuring the final value of `x` is the correct decimal representation of the input number `k` in base `n`.

However, there is a crucial point that needs to be addressed. The function summary mentions that the function ensures all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and that `k` contains no more than 60 symbols. This ensures that the conversion will not overflow and will produce the correct result under the given constraints.

The provided code does not include any checks for invalid inputs such as characters that are not digits or that are equal to or greater than `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the input number `k` is a valid representation in base `n` and all digits are strictly less than `n`, the provided solution should handle this correctly.

Additionally, the constraints specify that the answer exists and does not exceed \(10^{18}\). Given these constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution should work correctly under these assumptions.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Final: **True**
