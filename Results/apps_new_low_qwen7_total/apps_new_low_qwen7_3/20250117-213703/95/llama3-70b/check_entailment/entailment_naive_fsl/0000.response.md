Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a number `k` from a given base `n` back to its decimal representation. The program iterates through each digit of `k` in reverse order, converting it to decimal and adding it to the result after appropriately scaling it by powers of `n`. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program works correctly for all valid inputs as per the examples provided and the problem statement.
