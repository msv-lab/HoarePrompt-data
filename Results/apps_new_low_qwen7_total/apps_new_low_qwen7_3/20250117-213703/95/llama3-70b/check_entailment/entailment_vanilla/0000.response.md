Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the base `n` and the number `k` in the specified format.
2. **Reversing the String**: The program reverses the string `k` before iterating over it. This ensures that each digit is processed from the least significant to the most significant position, which is necessary for correct conversion.
3. **Loop through Digits**: The loop iterates through each character of the reversed string `k`, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (which is correctly calculated as `i`).
4. **Accumulation**: The result `x` accumulates the converted value as the loop progresses, ensuring the final value of `x` is the correct decimal representation of the input number `k` in base `n`.

Given that the problem statement specifies that the input number `k` is a valid representation in base `n` and the constraints ensure that the answer exists and does not exceed \(10^{18}\), the provided solution should work correctly under these assumptions.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
