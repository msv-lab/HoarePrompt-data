You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1·16^2 + 13·16^1 + 11·16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.

Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ≤ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.

Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.

The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
12

Output
12
Input
16
11311

Output
475
Input
20
999

Output
3789
Input
17
2016

Output
594


-----Note-----

In the first example 12 could be obtained by converting two numbers to the system with base 13: 12 = 12·13^0 or 15 = 1·13^1 + 2·13^0.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = input()
    x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
    print(x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a string representing a number in a base-n numeral system, where all digits in k are strictly less than n and k contains no more than 60 symbols.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = input()

x = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(k)):
        x += int(c) * n ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is a non-empty string, `x` is the sum of `int(c) * n
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` representing a number in a base-n numeral system. It then converts `k` from the specified base `n` to its decimal (base-10) representation and prints the resulting integer `x`. The function ensures that all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and that `k` contains no more than 60 symbols. If `k` is empty or any digit in `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function will not behave as expected and may result in incorrect output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the base `n` and the number `k` in the specified format.
2. **Reversing the String**: The program reverses the string `k` before iterating over it. This ensures that each digit is processed from the least significant to the most significant position, which is necessary for correct conversion.
3. **Loop through Digits**: The loop iterates through each character of the reversed string `k`, converts it to an integer, and multiplies it by `n` raised to the power of its position index (which is correctly calculated as `i`).
4. **Accumulation**: The result `x` accumulates the converted value as the loop progresses, ensuring the final value of `x` is the correct decimal representation of the input number `k` in base `n`.

Given that the problem statement specifies that the input number `k` is a valid representation in base `n` and the constraints ensure that the answer exists and does not exceed \(10^{18}\), the provided solution should work correctly under these assumptions.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
