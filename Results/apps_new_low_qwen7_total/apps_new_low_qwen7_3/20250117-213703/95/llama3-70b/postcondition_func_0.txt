The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and a string `k` representing a number in a base-n numeral system. It then converts `k` from the specified base `n` to its decimal (base-10) representation and prints the resulting integer `x`. The function ensures that all digits in `k` are strictly less than `n` and that `k` contains no more than 60 symbols. If `k` is empty or any digit in `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function will not behave as expected and may result in incorrect output.
