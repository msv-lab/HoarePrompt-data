Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive, checking each integer to determine if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If an integer meets this criterion, it increments a counter. After completing the iteration, the function returns the total count of such integers. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal by still iterating through the single integer in the range, ensuring that all possible integers within the specified range are considered.**
