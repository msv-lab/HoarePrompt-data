Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\)
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)
   - `year` is `a`
   - `count` is 1 if `year` has exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 0

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for year in range(a, b + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - The loop will continue as long as `year` is within this range.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop increments `year` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `year` will be `a + 1`.
   - The variable `count` will remain unchanged unless the new value of `year` (which is now `a + 1`) has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they define the range for the loop.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `b` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `year` becomes `a + 1`.
   - `count` remains 1 if `year` (now `a + 1`) has exactly one zero in its binary representation; otherwise, it remains 0.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 1`, `count` is 1 if `year` has exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 0**.
