Functionality: **The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It converts `x` into its binary representation and checks if this binary representation contains exactly one '0'. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary '0'), which technically has one '0', and when `x` is a power of two (binary representation consists of a single '1' followed by zeros). The function correctly handles these cases by counting the number of '0's in the binary representation and returning `True` only if this count is exactly one.**

The provided annotation is almost correct but could be more detailed about edge cases. The function correctly identifies the presence of exactly one '0' in the binary representation of `x`, including handling the edge case where `x` is 0. There is no missing functionality in the given code.
