Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 2`, `count` is 3 if the original count was 2 and `year` had exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 2.***
