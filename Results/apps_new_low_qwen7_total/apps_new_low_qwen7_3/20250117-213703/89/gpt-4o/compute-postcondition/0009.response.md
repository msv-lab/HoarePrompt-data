`count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 2 if `year` had exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 1. After incrementing, `count` will be 3 if it was 2, or 2 if it was 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 2`, `count` is 3 if the original count was 2, or 2 if the original count was 1.**
