The code `binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]` converts the integer `x` to its binary representation using `bin(x)` and then slices off the first two characters ('0b') to get the binary string without the prefix. The binary representation of `x` is stored in `binary_representation`. 

Given the initial state where `x` is a non-negative integer with exactly one zero in its binary representation, the output state will be:

- The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- A new variable `binary_representation` is created, which holds the binary string of `x` without the '0b' prefix.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that the binary representation of `x` contains exactly one zero; `binary_representation` is the binary string of `x` without the '0b' prefix.**
