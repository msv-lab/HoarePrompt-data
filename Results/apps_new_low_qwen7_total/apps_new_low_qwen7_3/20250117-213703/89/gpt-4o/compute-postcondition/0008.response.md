Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `year` and the bounds `a` and `b`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop iterates over the range from `a` to `b + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the current value of `year` must be less than `b + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `year` is `a + 1`.
   - `count` is 2 if `year` had exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `year` is currently `a + 1`, the next value of `year` should be `a + 2` to continue the loop.
   - The value of `b` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The value of `count` remains the same as determined by the previous iteration's `year`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `year` changes from `a + 1` to `a + 2`.
- `count` remains the same as determined by the previous iteration's `year`.

**State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 2`, `count` is 2 if `year` had exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 1**.
