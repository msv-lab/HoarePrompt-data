`count` is initially set to 1 if `year` has exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 0. The code `count += 1` increments `count` by 1. So, the new value of `count` is the original value of `count` plus 1.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\)
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)
- `year` is `a + 1`
- `count` is 1 if `year` has exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` remains 0

After executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `a + 1`, `count` is 2 if `year` had exactly one zero in its binary representation, otherwise `count` is 1**
