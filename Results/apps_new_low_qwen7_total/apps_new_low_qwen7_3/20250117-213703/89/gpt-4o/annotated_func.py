    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `b + 1`, `count` is the number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of integers between a and b inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive, checking each integer to determine if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If an integer meets this criterion, it increments a counter. After completing the iteration, the function returns the total count of such integers. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal by still iterating through the single integer in the range, ensuring that all possible integers within the specified range are considered.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer such that the binary representation of x contains exactly one zero.
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1
    #True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It converts `x` into its binary representation and checks if this binary representation contains exactly one '0'. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary '0'), which technically has one '0', and when `x` is a power of two (binary representation consists of a single '1' followed by zeros). The function correctly handles these cases by counting the number of '0's in the binary representation and returning `True` only if this count is exactly one.
