### Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the reasoning again to ensure completeness and accuracy:

1. **Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`:**
   - This function correctly converts a number to its binary representation using `bin(x)[2:]`.
   - It then counts the number of zeros in the binary string.
   - If the count is exactly 1, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - Edge cases such as when `x` is 0 (which technically has one '0') and when `x` is a power of two (which has a single '1' followed by zeros) are correctly handled by counting the number of zeros.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each year, it calls `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` to check if the year meets the criteria.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the `count`.
   - Finally, it returns the `count`.

3. **Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
   - The provided functions directly address this requirement without making any incorrect assumptions or omissions.

### Verification:
- The `bin()` function correctly converts the integer to its binary string.
- The slicing `[2:]` correctly removes the '0b' prefix.
- The `count('0')` method accurately counts the number of zeros in the binary string.
- The loop in `func_1` correctly iterates through the range `[a, b]` and applies the binary check for each year.

Since the logic implemented in both functions directly aligns with the requirements of the problem and no assumptions beyond those specified in the problem are made, the given program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: True**
