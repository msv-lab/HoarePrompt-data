You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year):
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It converts `x` into its binary representation and checks if this binary representation contains exactly one '0'. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary '0'), which technically has one '0', and when `x` is a power of two (binary representation consists of a single '1' followed by zeros). The function correctly handles these cases by counting the number of '0's in the binary representation and returning `True` only if this count is exactly one.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the solution step-by-step and verify it against the problem statement.

### Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`:
This function checks whether the binary representation of a given number `x` has exactly one zero. It converts the number to its binary form using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix, and then counts the number of zeros. If the count is exactly 1, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Function `func_1`:
This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and uses the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function to check if the year meets the criteria. If it does, it increments the `count`. Finally, it returns the `count`.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires counting how many years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

### Verification:
- The `bin()` function correctly converts the integer to its binary string.
- The slicing `[2:]` correctly removes the '0b' prefix.
- The `count('0')` method accurately counts the number of zeros in the binary string.
- The loop in `func_1` correctly iterates through the range `[a, b]` and applies the binary check for each year.

Since the logic implemented in both functions directly aligns with the requirements of the problem and no assumptions beyond those specified in the problem are made, the given program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
