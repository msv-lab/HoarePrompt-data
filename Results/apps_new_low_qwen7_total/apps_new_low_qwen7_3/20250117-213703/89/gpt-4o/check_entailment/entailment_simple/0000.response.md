Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input and processes the interval [a, b] correctly.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each year in the given range and checks if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation using the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
3. However, there is an issue with the logic in the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`. It does not correctly identify the binary representation with exactly one zero. Instead, it counts the number of zeros in the binary representation and checks if this count is 1.
4. For example, the binary representation of 1010 (which is 10 in decimal) would be '1010' and the function would incorrectly return True because it contains 1 zero, but actually, we need to check if the binary representation has exactly one '0' among all other characters.
5. To fix this, we need to implement a different approach to check for exactly one '0' in the binary string.

Given the provided code and the need to fix the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
