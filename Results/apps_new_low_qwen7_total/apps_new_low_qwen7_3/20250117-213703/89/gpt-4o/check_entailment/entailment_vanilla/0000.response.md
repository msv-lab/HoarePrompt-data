Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the solution step-by-step and verify it against the problem statement.

### Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`:
This function checks whether the binary representation of a given number `x` has exactly one zero. It converts the number to its binary form using `bin(x)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix, and then counts the number of zeros. If the count is exactly 1, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Function `func_1`:
This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and uses the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function to check if the year meets the criteria. If it does, it increments the `count`. Finally, it returns the `count`.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires counting how many years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

### Verification:
- The `bin()` function correctly converts the integer to its binary string.
- The slicing `[2:]` correctly removes the '0b' prefix.
- The `count('0')` method accurately counts the number of zeros in the binary string.
- The loop in `func_1` correctly iterates through the range `[a, b]` and applies the binary check for each year.

Since the logic implemented in both functions directly aligns with the requirements of the problem and no assumptions beyond those specified in the problem are made, the given program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
