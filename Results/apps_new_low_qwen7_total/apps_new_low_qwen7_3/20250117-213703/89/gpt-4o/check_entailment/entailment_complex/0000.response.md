Reasoning:
- The annotated functions provide a clear understanding of how the program works.
- `func_1` iterates through every year from `a` to `b` inclusive and counts those years which have exactly one zero in their binary representation using the helper function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` correctly checks if a number has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
- The program reads input correctly, processes the range of years, and outputs the count of years meeting the criteria.
- There are no logical errors in the provided functions.
- All conditions in the problem statement are handled correctly, including the edge case where `a` and `b` are the same.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
