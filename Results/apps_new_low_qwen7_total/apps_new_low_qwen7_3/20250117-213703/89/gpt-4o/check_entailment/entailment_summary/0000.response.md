Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`.
- `func_1` iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` and uses `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` to check if each integer has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If so, it increments a counter.
- `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` correctly converts a number to its binary representation, counts the number of zeros, and returns `True` if there is exactly one zero, and `False` otherwise.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program should correctly count the number of years within the interval `[a, b]` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
- There are no apparent logical errors or inefficiencies in the code provided, and the functions work as expected according to the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
