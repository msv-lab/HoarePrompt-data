### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the given problem description and the annotations.

#### Function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`:
- This function correctly converts the integer `x` to its binary representation and counts the number of zeros.
- It returns `True` if there is exactly one zero and `False` otherwise.
- Edge cases such as `x = 0` and powers of two are handled correctly.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function iterates through each year from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
- For each year, it checks if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation using the `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` function.
- It increments the `count` if the condition is met.
- After the loop, it returns the `count`.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to count the number of years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

#### Verification:
- The conversion to binary and the counting of zeros are done correctly.
- The loop iterates through all years in the given range and checks the condition for each year.
- The overall logic matches the problem requirements.

However, there is a potential issue with the implementation of `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary`. While the function correctly counts the number of zeros in the binary representation, it does not account for the fact that the year itself must be a positive integer greater than 0. Specifically, any year that is a power of two (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) will have exactly one zero in its binary representation but would not be considered valid according to the problem statement (since the binary representation should not start with a zero).

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the range `[1, 10]`. According to the problem, the valid years are those with exactly one zero in their binary representation, excluding 0 (which is not in the range).

- Binary representations:
  - 1: `1` (no zero)
  - 2: `10` (one zero)
  - 3: `11` (no zero)
  - 4: `100` (one zero)
  - 5: `101` (one zero)
  - 6: `110` (one zero)
  - 7: `111` (no zero)
  - 8: `1000` (one zero)
  - 9: `1001` (one zero)
  - 10: `1010` (one zero)

The correct answer should be 6 (2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). However, the current implementation will count 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, which is correct, but it does not exclude 0 explicitly.

### Correctness:
The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` should handle the edge case where the number is a power of two and ensure that the year itself is not zero. However, the current implementation does not explicitly exclude 0, and it does not account for the fact that the year must be greater than 0.

Given this, the program is not entirely correct as it does not fully adhere to the problem's requirement of considering only positive integers in the binary representation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly exclude the year 0 and does not account for the fact that the binary representation of the year should not start with a zero.
