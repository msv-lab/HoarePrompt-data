You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year):
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    result = func_1(a, b)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(year):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^{18}\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), `year` is `b + 1`, `count` is the number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of integers between a and b inclusive that have exactly one zero in their binary representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). It iterates through all integers from `a` to `b` inclusive, checking each integer to determine if it has exactly one zero in its binary representation. If an integer meets this criterion, it increments a counter. After completing the iteration, the function returns the total count of such integers. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal by still iterating through the single integer in the range, ensuring that all possible integers within the specified range are considered.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer such that the binary representation of x contains exactly one zero.
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    return binary_representation.count('0') == 1
    #True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It converts `x` into its binary representation and checks if this binary representation contains exactly one '0'. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0 (binary '0'), which technically has one '0', and when `x` is a power of two (binary representation consists of a single '1' followed by zeros). The function correctly handles these cases by counting the number of '0's in the binary representation and returning `True` only if this count is exactly one.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the years within the given interval that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. 

Consider the input `a = 1` and `b = 2`. According to the problem description, the only year in this interval that has exactly one zero in its binary representation is `2` (binary: `10`). However, the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` incorrectly counts `1` (binary: `1`) because it has no zeros, and `2` (binary: `10`) because it has exactly one zero. Thus, the function would incorrectly return `2` instead of `1`.

To fix this, the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` needs to correctly check if the binary representation of the number has exactly one zero. The current implementation only checks the count of zeros but does not account for the position of the zero. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    zero_count = binary_representation.count('0')
    # Check if there is exactly one '0' and all other bits are '1'
    return zero_count == 1 and binary_representation.replace('0', '') == '1' * (len(binary_representation) - 1)
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all potential cases.
