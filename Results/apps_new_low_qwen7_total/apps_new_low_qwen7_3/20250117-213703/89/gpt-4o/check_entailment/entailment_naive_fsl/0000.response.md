Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the years within the given interval that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. 

Consider the input `a = 1` and `b = 2`. According to the problem description, the only year in this interval that has exactly one zero in its binary representation is `2` (binary: `10`). However, the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` incorrectly counts `1` (binary: `1`) because it has no zeros, and `2` (binary: `10`) because it has exactly one zero. Thus, the function would incorrectly return `2` instead of `1`.

To fix this, the function `has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary` needs to correctly check if the binary representation of the number has exactly one zero. The current implementation only checks the count of zeros but does not account for the position of the zero. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def has_exactly_one_zero_in_binary(x):
    binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]
    zero_count = binary_representation.count('0')
    # Check if there is exactly one '0' and all other bits are '1'
    return zero_count == 1 and binary_representation.replace('0', '') == '1' * (len(binary_representation) - 1)
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for all potential cases.
