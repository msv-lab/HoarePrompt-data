`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1 if the number of zeros in `year` is exactly 1, otherwise 0. After incrementing, `count` will be 2 if the number of zeros in `year` was 1, or 1 if it was 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `year` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a valid starting point (1 <= a <= 10^18), `b` is a non-negative integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), `year` is equal to `a + 1`, and `count` is 2 if the number of zeros in `year` was 1, otherwise 1.**
