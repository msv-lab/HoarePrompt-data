Functionality: **The function `count_zeros` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of '0' characters in its binary representation. This includes handling the case where `n` is 0, which would result in a binary string "0" containing one '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in incorrect behavior since the function relies on `bin(n)` which is only defined for non-negative integers.**
