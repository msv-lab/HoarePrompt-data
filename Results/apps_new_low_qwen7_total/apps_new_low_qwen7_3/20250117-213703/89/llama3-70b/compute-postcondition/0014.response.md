Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)), and iterates through each year in the range \([a, b]\). For each year, it checks the number of zeros in the year. If the number of zeros is exactly 1, it increments a counter. After completing the iteration, the function returns the total count of years within the specified range where the number of zeros is exactly 1. Potential edge cases include when `a` or `b` are at their boundary values (1 or \(10^{18}\)).**

**Note:** The annotation and return postcondition are correct, but itâ€™s important to mention that the function does not check for invalid inputs outside the specified range or handle cases where `a > b`. These are potential edge cases that should be addressed in a robust implementation.
