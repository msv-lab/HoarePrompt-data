The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\). The function returns the count, which is the total number of years within the range \([a, b]\) inclusive where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)), and return the count of years within the range \([a, b]\) where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1.
