Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly defines two functions: `func_1` and `count_zeros`.
2. The `count_zeros` function converts a given integer `n` into its binary representation and counts the number of '0' characters in that binary string.
3. The `func_1` function iterates through each year in the given range `[a, b]` (inclusive) and uses the `count_zeros` function to check if the binary representation of the year has exactly one '0'.
4. If the condition is met, the count is incremented.
5. After the loop completes, the function returns the total count of years meeting the criteria.
6. The input handling and function calls are correct, and the logic for determining the count of years with exactly one zero in their binary representation is sound.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program accurately solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
