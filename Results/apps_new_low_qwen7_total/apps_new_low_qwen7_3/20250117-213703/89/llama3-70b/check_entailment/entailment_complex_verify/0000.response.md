### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `count_zeros(n)`:
- This function correctly counts the number of zeros in the binary representation of `n`.
- It uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert `n` to its binary string representation and then counts the occurrences of '0'.
- This function works as intended for any non-negative integer `n`.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- This function aims to count how many years between `a` and `b` (inclusive) have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
- It iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]`.
- For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)` and checks if the result is exactly 1.
- If so, it increments the `count` variable.
- Finally, it returns the total count.

#### Annotations:
- The annotation correctly describes the state of the program after the `for` loop. At the end of the loop, `year` will be `b + 1`, and `count` will hold the total number of years in the range `[a, b]` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]` and checks the number of zeros in the binary representation.
- The function `count_zeros` correctly counts the zeros in the binary representation.
- The program handles the range `[a, b]` correctly and returns the expected count.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the range boundaries properly.
- The function `count_zeros` works correctly for both small and large integers within the given constraints (1 to \(10^{18}\)).

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the input `a = 72057594000000000` and `b = 72057595000000000`. The expected output is 26.
- The program will correctly iterate through the range and count the years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.
- The logic in the loop ensures that only the correct years are counted.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is incorrect. The program provided does indeed work correctly for the given problem description and examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
