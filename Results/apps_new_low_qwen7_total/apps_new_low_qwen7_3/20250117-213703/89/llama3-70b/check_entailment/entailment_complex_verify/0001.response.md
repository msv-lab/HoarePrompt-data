### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logical structure and functionality of the program. However, we need to ensure that the program works as expected for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

#### Function `count_zeros(n)`:
- Converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`.
- Counts the number of '0' characters in the binary string.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- Iterates through each year in the range `[a, b]`.
- Calls `count_zeros(year)` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
- Increments the counter `count` if the condition is met.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The initial state before `func_1` is called is correct, and the function properly iterates through the range `[a, b]`.
- The `for` loop correctly checks each year in the range.
- The `if` statement inside the loop correctly uses the `count_zeros(year)` function to determine if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
- The counter `count` is incremented appropriately when the condition is met.
- The function returns the correct count after the loop completes.

Given that the problem constraints are \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\), and the logic implemented in both functions is sound, the program should correctly count the years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality, and there are no logical errors or potential edge cases that would make it incorrect.

### Final:
**True**
