### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: Takes two integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)).
   - **Process**: Iterates through each year from `a` to `b`, inclusive.
   - **Check**: For each year, it calls `count_zeros(year)` to check if the year has exactly one zero in its binary representation.
   - **Counting**: Increments a counter `count` if the condition is met.
   - **Return**: Returns the total count of years with exactly one zero in their binary representation.

2. **Function `count_zeros`**:
   - **Input**: A non-negative integer `n`.
   - **Process**: Converts the integer `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`.
   - **Check**: Counts the number of '0' characters in the binary string.
   - **Return**: Returns the count of '0' characters.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Both functions handle non-negative integers correctly.
   - The `count_zeros` function handles the edge case where `n` is 0, returning 1 '0' character.
   - The `func_1` function handles the range constraint correctly by iterating from `a` to `b`.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input range `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` which correctly counts the number of years within the range `[a, b]` that have exactly one zero in their binary representation.
   - The output matches the expected results provided in the examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All functions work as intended and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
