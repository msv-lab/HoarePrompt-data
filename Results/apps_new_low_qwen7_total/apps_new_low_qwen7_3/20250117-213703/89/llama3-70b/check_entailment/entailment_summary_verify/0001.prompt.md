You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `count_zeros` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of '0' characters in its binary representation. This includes handling the case where `n` is 0, which would result in a binary string "0" containing one '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in incorrect behavior since the function relies on `bin(n)` which is only defined for non-negative integers.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that iterates through each year in the given interval `[a, b]`.
- For each year, it calls the `count_zeros` function to check if the number of zeros in the binary representation of the year is exactly one.
- If so, it increments the counter `count`.
- The `count_zeros` function converts the number to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and counts the number of '0' characters in that string.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for counting years with exactly one zero in their binary representation within the specified interval.

Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem description.
