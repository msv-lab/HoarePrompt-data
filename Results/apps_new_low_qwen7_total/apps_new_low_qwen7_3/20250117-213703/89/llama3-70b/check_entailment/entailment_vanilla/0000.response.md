Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that iterates through each year in the given interval `[a, b]`.
- For each year, it calls the `count_zeros` function to check if the number of zeros in the binary representation of the year is exactly one.
- If so, it increments the counter `count`.
- The `count_zeros` function converts the number to its binary representation using `bin(n)` and counts the number of '0' characters in that string.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for counting years with exactly one zero in their binary representation within the specified interval.

Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem description.
