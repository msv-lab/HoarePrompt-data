Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting how many years in a given range have exactly one '0' in their binary representation.
2. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly iterates through each year in the given range and uses `count_zeros` to check if there is exactly one '0' in the binary representation of the year. If so, it increments the count.
   - **count_zeros**: This function correctly counts the number of '0's in the binary representation of a given year. It uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary and then counts the '0's.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Both functions handle the range correctly, including boundary values like `1` and `10^18`.
   - Negative inputs are not expected, and the code inherently avoids dealing with them.
4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The helper function `count_zeros` works correctly and efficiently.
5. **Execution Summary**: The execution summaries confirm the intended behavior of both functions.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
