Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of years in the interval [a, b] that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. Specifically, the program iterates through each year in the given range and checks the number of zeros in the binary representation using the `count_zeros` function. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed because it does not correctly handle the end of the range and the condition checking for exactly one zero.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

For the input:
```
a = 72057594000000000
b = 72057595000000000
```

The output should be 26, as stated in the example. However, the provided program will not produce the correct result because it does not efficiently handle large ranges and the specific condition of having exactly one zero in the binary representation.

A correct approach would involve generating the numbers that meet the criteria directly rather than iterating through the entire range. For instance, the numbers with exactly one zero in their binary representation can be generated by constructing the binary patterns manually and converting them to decimal form within the given range.

Since the provided program does not work correctly for the given problem description and examples, the correctness is **False**.
