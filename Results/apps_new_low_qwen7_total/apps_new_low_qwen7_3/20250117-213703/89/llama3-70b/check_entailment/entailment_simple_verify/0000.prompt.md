You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The year 2015 is almost over.

Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 2015_10 = 11111011111_2. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.

Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?

Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 10

Output
2

Input
2015 2015

Output
1

Input
100 105

Output
0

Input
72057594000000000 72057595000000000

Output
26



-----Note-----

In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):

    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')



- Annotated Code: 
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a valid starting point (1 <= a <= 10^18), `b` is a non-negative integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), `year` is equal to `b + 1`, and `count` is the total number of years within the range `[a, b]` inclusive where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of years within the range [a, b] inclusive where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0' characters in the binary representation of 'n'




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of years in the interval [a, b] that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. Specifically, the program iterates through each year in the given range and checks the number of zeros in the binary representation using the `count_zeros` function. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed because it does not correctly handle the end of the range and the condition checking for exactly one zero.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

For the input:
```
a = 72057594000000000
b = 72057595000000000
```

The output should be 26, as stated in the example. However, the provided program will not produce the correct result because it does not efficiently handle large ranges and the specific condition of having exactly one zero in the binary representation.

A correct approach would involve generating the numbers that meet the criteria directly rather than iterating through the entire range. For instance, the numbers with exactly one zero in their binary representation can be generated by constructing the binary patterns manually and converting them to decimal form within the given range.

Since the provided program does not work correctly for the given problem description and examples, the correctness is **False**.
