#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10^18.
def func_1(a, b):
    count = 0
    for year in range(a, b + 1):
        if count_zeros(year) == 1:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a valid starting point (1 <= a <= 10^18), `b` is a non-negative integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), `year` is equal to `b + 1`, and `count` is the total number of years within the range `[a, b]` inclusive where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of years within the range [a, b] inclusive where the number of zeros in the year is exactly 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^{18}\)), and iterates through each year in the range \([a, b]\). For each year, it checks the number of zeros in the year. If the number of zeros is exactly 1, it increments a counter. After completing the iteration, the function returns the total count of years within the specified range where the number of zeros is exactly 1. Potential edge cases include when `a` or `b` are at their boundary values (1 or \(10^{18}\)).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def count_zeros(n):
    return bin(n).count('0')
    #The program returns the count of '0' characters in the binary representation of 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_zeros` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of '0' characters in its binary representation. This includes handling the case where `n` is 0, which would result in a binary string "0" containing one '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in incorrect behavior since the function relies on `bin(n)` which is only defined for non-negative integers.
