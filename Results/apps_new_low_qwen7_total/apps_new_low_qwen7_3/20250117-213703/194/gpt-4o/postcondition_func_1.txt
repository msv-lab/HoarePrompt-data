The function reads four integers from user input, representing the elements of a 2x2 matrix A. It then calls another function `func_1` with this matrix as input. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to 10 decimal places. If the input values are outside the range of \( -10^9 \) to \( 10^9 \), the behavior is undefined. No parameters are accepted by this function.
