### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of `func_1` and ensure it correctly computes the minimum norm required to make the matrix degenerate.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - The determinant calculation \( ad - bc \) is correct.

2. **Degenerate Check**:
   - If the determinant is zero, the function correctly returns 0.0.

3. **Minimizing Norm**:
   - The function attempts to modify each element to make the matrix degenerate by ensuring the determinant becomes zero.
   - However, the approach of setting each element to a derived value based on the largest absolute value might not always yield the correct minimum norm.

#### Detailed Breakdown:

- **If \( |a| \geq \max(|b|, |c|, |d|) \)**:
  - Set \( b' = \frac{ac}{d} \) if \( d \neq 0 \).
  - Calculate \( \text{min\_norm\_value} = |a - a'| \).

- **If \( |b| \geq \max(|a|, |c|, |d|) \)**:
  - Set \( a' = \frac{bd}{c} \) if \( c \neq 0 \).
  - Calculate \( \text{min\_norm\_value} = |b - b'| \).

- **If \( |c| \geq \max(|a|, |b|, |d|) \)**:
  - Set \( d' = \frac{bc}{a} \) if \( a \neq 0 \).
  - Calculate \( \text{min\_norm\_value} = |c - c'| \).

- **If \( |d| \geq \max(|a|, |b|, |c|) \)**:
  - Set \( b' = \frac{ac}{d} \) if \( d \neq 0 \).
  - Calculate \( \text{min\_norm\_value} = |d - d'| \).

The issue lies in the fact that this approach does not guarantee finding the global minimum norm. For instance, consider the case where the largest absolute value is shared among multiple elements, and setting one element to make the determinant zero might not minimize the norm effectively.

#### Correct Approach:

To find the correct minimum norm, we need to consider the exact minimal adjustments needed to make the matrix degenerate. This involves solving the system of equations directly:

1. **Solve for \( b' \) when \( a \) is fixed**:
   - \( ad' - bc = 0 \) => \( d' = \frac{bc}{a} \).
   - Minimize \( |a - a'| = |a - 0| = |a| \).

2. **Solve for \( a' \) when \( b \) is fixed**:
   - \( ab' - cd = 0 \) => \( b' = \frac{cd}{a} \).
   - Minimize \( |b - b'| = |b - 0| = |b| \).

3. **Solve for \( c' \) when \( d \) is fixed**:
   - \( ac' - bd = 0 \) => \( c' = \frac{bd}{a} \).
   - Minimize \( |c - c'| = |c - 0| = |c| \).

4. **Solve for \( d' \) when \( c \) is fixed**:
   - \( ad' - bc = 0 \) => \( d' = \frac{bc}{a} \).
   - Minimize \( |d - d'| = |d - 0| = |d| \).

We need to take the minimum of these absolute differences to ensure the correct minimum norm.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the potential flaw in the current logic. The provided solution does not fully address all edge cases and might fail for some inputs.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to handle all cases properly and find the true minimum norm required to make the matrix degenerate.
