 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

Output
0.5000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `A` containing four integers `[a, b, c, d]`. It calculates the determinant of the matrix formed by these integers and checks if the determinant is zero. If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0. If the determinant is non-zero, the function computes several derived values (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, `d_prime`) based on the maximum absolute value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then determines the minimum norm value (`min_norm_value`) based on specific conditions involving these derived values. The function returns the calculated `min_norm_value`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    (a, b) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]))
    (c, d) = (int(data[2]), int(data[3]))
    A = [[a, b], [c, d]]
    result = func_1(A)
    print(f'{result:.10f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads four integers from user input, representing the elements of a 2x2 matrix A. It then calls another function `func_1` with this matrix as input. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to 10 decimal places. If the input values are outside the range of \( -10^9 \) to \( 10^9 \), the behavior is undefined. No parameters are accepted by this function.
