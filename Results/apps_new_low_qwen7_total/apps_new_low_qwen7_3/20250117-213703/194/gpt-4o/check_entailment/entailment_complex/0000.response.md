### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a 2x2 matrix represented as a list of lists `A` and calculates the minimum possible norm value (`||A - B||`) for a degenerate matrix `B`.
   - It first checks if the determinant of the matrix `A` is zero. If the determinant is zero, it directly returns 0.0 because any degenerate matrix will have the same determinant, and thus the norm difference would be zero.
   - If the determinant is non-zero, it calculates several derived values (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, `d_prime`) based on the maximum absolute value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then determines the minimum norm value (`min_norm_value`) based on specific conditions involving these derived values.
   - The logic used in `func_1` is based on the idea of minimizing the distance between the original matrix `A` and a degenerate matrix `B` such that the determinant of `B` is zero.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input values from the standard input and processes them to form a 2x2 matrix `A`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the matrix `A` and prints the result.
   - The input processing and the calculation of the norm value are handled correctly by `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly handles the input, processes the matrix, and computes the required norm value.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the minimum norm value is calculated accurately for both degenerate and non-degenerate matrices.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible norm value for a degenerate matrix `B` that minimizes `||A - B||`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
