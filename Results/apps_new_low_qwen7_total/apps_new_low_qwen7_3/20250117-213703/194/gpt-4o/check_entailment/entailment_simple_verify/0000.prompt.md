You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the determinant is zero but the matrix is not fully degenerate (i.e., not all elements can be adjusted to make the matrix degenerate). Specifically, the program only adjusts one element to make the determinant zero, which may not always yield the minimum possible norm ||A - B||.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 2
3 4
```
The determinant is \(1 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 3 = -2\), which is not zero. The program calculates the adjustment for `a` to make the determinant zero, resulting in `a' = b * c / d = 1.8`. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum norm. The correct degenerate matrix \(B\) that minimizes the norm is:
\[ B = \begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 1.8 \\ 2.8 & 4.2 \end{pmatrix} \]
The norm \(||A - B||\) is calculated as:
\[ \max(|1 - 1.2|, |2 - 1.8|, |3 - 2.8|, |4 - 4.2|) = 0.2 \]

However, the program only adjusts `a` and does not check other possible adjustments that could yield a smaller norm. Therefore, the program does not always find the minimum possible norm, making it incorrect.
