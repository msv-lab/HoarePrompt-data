You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The determinant of a matrix 2 × 2 is defined as follows:$\operatorname{det} \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right) = a d - b c$

A matrix is called degenerate if its determinant is equal to zero. 

The norm ||A|| of a matrix A is defined as a maximum of absolute values of its elements.

You are given a matrix $A = \left(\begin{array}{ll}{a} & {b} \\{c} & {d} \end{array} \right)$. Consider any degenerate matrix B such that norm ||A - B|| is minimum possible. Determine ||A - B||.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 10^9), the elements of the first row of matrix A. 

The second line contains two integers c and d (|c|, |d| ≤ 10^9) the elements of the second row of matrix A.


-----Output-----

Output a single real number, the minimum possible value of ||A - B||. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2
3 4

Output
0.2000000000

Input
1 0
0 1

Output
0.5000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{1.2} & {1.8} \\{2.8} & {4.2} \end{array} \right)$

In the second sample matrix B is $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{0.5} & {0.5} \\{0.5} & {0.5} \end{array} \right)$

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` reads input and processes it using `func_1`.
3. `func_1` calculates the determinant of the given matrix \(A\) and checks if it's degenerate.
4. If the matrix is not degenerate, `func_1` tries to modify each element to make the matrix degenerate while minimizing the change in the norm.

Let's analyze `func_1` step-by-step:

- **Determinant Calculation**: The determinant is correctly calculated as \(ad - bc\).
- **Degenerate Check**: If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0 immediately, which is correct.
- **Minimizing Norm**:
  - For each element, it computes the modified value (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, etc.) that would make the matrix degenerate.
  - It calculates the absolute difference between the original element and its modified value.
  - The minimum of these differences is returned.

Here’s the detailed breakdown:
- If \(|a|\) is the largest, it sets \(b' = \frac{ac}{d}\) (if \(d \neq 0\)).
- If \(|b|\) is the largest, it sets \(a' = \frac{bd}{c}\) (if \(c \neq 0\)).
- If \(|c|\) is the largest, it sets \(d' = \frac{bc}{a}\) (if \(a \neq 0\)).
- If \(|d|\) is the largest, it sets \(b' = \frac{ac}{d}\) (if \(d \neq 0\)).

Given the conditions and the logic, the program should correctly compute the minimum norm for a degenerate matrix \(B\).

However, there is an issue with the logic. Specifically, the way the modifications are handled can lead to incorrect results because the conditions might not cover all cases properly. For example, the order of checking the absolute values and setting the prime values might not always yield the correct minimum norm.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  1 2
  3 4
  ```
- Expected output: 
  ```
  0.2000000000
  ```

The correct solution should consider the actual minimal adjustments needed to make the matrix degenerate. This involves calculating the exact minimal changes rather than just checking the largest absolute values.

Therefore, the provided solution does not fully address all edge cases and might fail for some inputs.
