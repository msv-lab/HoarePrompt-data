Reasoning:
1. The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` reads input and processes it using `func_1`.
3. `func_1` calculates the determinant of the given matrix \(A\) and checks if it's degenerate.
4. If the matrix is not degenerate, `func_1` tries to modify each element to make the matrix degenerate while minimizing the change in the norm.

Let's analyze `func_1` step-by-step:

- **Determinant Calculation**: The determinant is correctly calculated as \(ad - bc\).
- **Degenerate Check**: If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0 immediately, which is correct.
- **Minimizing Norm**:
  - For each element, it computes the modified value (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, etc.) that would make the matrix degenerate.
  - It calculates the absolute difference between the original element and its modified value.
  - The minimum of these differences is returned.

Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:
- If \(|a|\) is the largest, it sets \(b' = \frac{ac}{d}\) (if \(d \neq 0\)).
- If \(|b|\) is the largest, it sets \(a' = \frac{bd}{c}\) (if \(c \neq 0\)).
- If \(|c|\) is the largest, it sets \(d' = \frac{bc}{a}\) (if \(a \neq 0\)).
- If \(|d|\) is the largest, it sets \(b' = \frac{ac}{d}\) (if \(d \neq 0\)).

Given the conditions and the logic, the program should correctly compute the minimum norm for a degenerate matrix \(B\).

However, there is an issue with the logic. Specifically, the way the modifications are handled can lead to incorrect results because the conditions might not cover all cases properly. For example, the order of checking the absolute values and setting the prime values might not always yield the correct minimum norm.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  1 2
  3 4
  ```
- Expected output: 
  ```
  0.2000000000
  ```

The correct solution should consider the actual minimal adjustments needed to make the matrix degenerate. This involves calculating the exact minimal changes rather than just checking the largest absolute values.

Therefore, the provided solution does not fully address all edge cases and might fail for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**
