### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the logic in `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the function and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to find the minimum possible value of the norm \(||A - B||\) where \(B\) is a degenerate matrix such that \( \det(B) = 0 \).

#### Key Points from the Original Assessment
1. **Determinant Calculation**: Correct.
2. **Degenerate Check**: Correctly handles the case where the determinant is zero.
3. **Minimizing Norm**:
   - The logic in `func_1` attempts to modify each element individually but does not ensure the overall minimum norm is achieved.
   - The conditions for modifying each element might not cover all cases properly, leading to suboptimal solutions.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`
Let's break down the logic in `func_1` again:

1. **Determinant Calculation**: 
   \[
   \text{det} = ad - bc
   \]
   This part is correct.

2. **Degenerate Check**:
   - If the determinant is zero, return 0.0, which is correct.

3. **Minimizing Norm**:
   - The function checks the absolute values of \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) and modifies the corresponding element to make the matrix degenerate.
   - However, the approach might not always yield the correct minimum norm. For example, if \(|a|\) is the largest, setting \(b' = \frac{ac}{d}\) does not necessarily minimize the norm compared to other potential modifications.

#### Example Test Case: \(A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{array}\right)\)
- Determinant: \(1 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 3 = -2\)
- Since the determinant is not zero, we need to find the closest degenerate matrix.

To achieve a determinant of zero, we need to set either \(a \cdot d = b \cdot c\). The optimal way to do this is to adjust the elements proportionally to maintain the ratio.

- Adjusting \(b\) to \(1.8\) and \(c\) to \(2.8\) gives us:
  \[
  \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1.8 \\ 3 & 2.8\end{array}\right)
  \]
  Determinant: \(1 \cdot 2.8 - 1.8 \cdot 3 = 2.8 - 5.4 = -2.6\) (still not zero, but closer)

- Adjusting \(c\) to \(2.8\) and \(b\) to \(1.8\) gives us:
  \[
  \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1.8 \\ 3 & 2.8\end{array}\right)
  \]
  Determinant: \(1 \cdot 2.8 - 1.8 \cdot 3 = 2.8 - 5.4 = -2.6\) (still not zero, but closer)

- Adjusting \(d\) to \(2.1\) and \(a\) to \(1.5\) gives us:
  \[
  \left(\begin{array}{cc}1.5 & 2 \\ 3 & 2.1\end{array}\right)
  \]
  Determinant: \(1.5 \cdot 2.1 - 2 \cdot 3 = 3.15 - 6 = -2.85\) (closer still)

The correct approach is to solve for the exact minimal adjustments to make the determinant zero.

### Conclusion
The provided logic in `func_1` does not guarantee the minimum norm. The original assessment was correct in identifying the flaw in the logic and the potential for incorrect results.

**Final: False**
