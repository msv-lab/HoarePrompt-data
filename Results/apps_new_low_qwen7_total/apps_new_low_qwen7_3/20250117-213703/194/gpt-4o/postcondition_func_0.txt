The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `A` containing four integers `[a, b, c, d]`. It calculates the determinant of the matrix formed by these integers and checks if the determinant is zero. If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0. If the determinant is non-zero, the function computes several derived values (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, `d_prime`) based on the maximum absolute value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then determines the minimum norm value (`min_norm_value`) based on specific conditions involving these derived values. The function returns the calculated `min_norm_value`.
