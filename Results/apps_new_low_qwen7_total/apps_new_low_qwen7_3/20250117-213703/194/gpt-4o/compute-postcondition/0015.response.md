Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are elements of matrix `A`, `det` is the determinant of `A`, which is not equal to 0, and `min_norm_value` is the minimum norm value based on specific conditions. If the absolute value of `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`, then `min_norm_value` is `abs(b - (a * d / c) if c != 0 else 0)`. Otherwise, `c_prime` is `(A[0][0] * A[1][1]) / A[0][1]` if `c` is not 0, and `d_prime` is `b * c / a` if `a` is not 0, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(A[1][0] - c_prime)` or `abs(d - d_prime)` accordingly.***
