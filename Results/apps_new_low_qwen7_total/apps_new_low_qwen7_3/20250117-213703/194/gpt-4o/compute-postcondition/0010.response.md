Postcondition: **`a` is A[0][0], `b` is A[0][1], `c` is A[1][0], `d` is A[1][1], `det` is not equal to 0, and the absolute value of `b`, `c`, and `d` is greater than the absolute value of `a`. Additionally, the absolute value of `b` is less than the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`. The current value of `abs(c)` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `abs(a)`, `abs(b)`, and `abs(d)`**
