Output State: **`min_norm_value` is calculated based on specific conditions. If `abs(a)` is greater than or equal to `max(abs(b), abs(c), abs(d))`, then `min_norm_value` is `abs(a - (b * c / d))`. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0, `c_prime` is `(A[0][0] * A[1][1]) / A[0][1]`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(A[1][0] - c_prime)`. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not 0, `d_prime` is `b * c / a`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(d - d_prime). The program returns `min_norm_value`**.
