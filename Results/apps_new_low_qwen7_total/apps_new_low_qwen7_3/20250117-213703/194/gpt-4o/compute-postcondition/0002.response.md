Functionality: **The function reads four integers from user input, representing the elements of a 2x2 matrix A. It then calls another function `func_1` with this matrix as input. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to 10 decimal places. If the input values are outside the range of \( -10^9 \) to \( 10^9 \), the behavior is undefined. No parameters are accepted by this function.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input contains more than four integers, only the first four integers will be considered.
- If the input contains fewer than four integers, the function will still proceed but will use invalid data for the remaining elements of the matrix.
- If the input integers exceed the range of \( -10^9 \) to \( 10^9 \), the behavior is undefined.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no validation or error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values).
