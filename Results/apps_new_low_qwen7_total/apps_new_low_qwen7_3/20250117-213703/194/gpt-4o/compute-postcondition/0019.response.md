Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `A` containing four integers `[a, b, c, d]`. It calculates the determinant of the matrix formed by these integers and checks if the determinant is zero. If the determinant is zero, the function returns 0.0. If the determinant is non-zero, the function computes several derived values (`a_prime`, `b_prime`, `c_prime`, `d_prime`) based on the maximum absolute value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then determines the minimum norm value (`min_norm_value`) based on specific conditions involving these derived values. The function returns the calculated `min_norm_value`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the determinant is zero, the function correctly returns 0.0.
- The function handles division by zero by setting the corresponding prime value to 0 when the denominator is zero.
- The function ensures that the derived values are computed only if their respective denominators are non-zero.
- The function correctly identifies the maximum absolute value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and uses it to determine which prime value to compute first.
- The function correctly updates `min_norm_value` based on the derived values and the specific conditions outlined in the code.
- If none of the conditions for computing derived values are met (i.e., all denominators are zero), the function should return `min_norm_value` as 0.0, but the current code does not handle this case explicitly. This is a potential missing functionality.
