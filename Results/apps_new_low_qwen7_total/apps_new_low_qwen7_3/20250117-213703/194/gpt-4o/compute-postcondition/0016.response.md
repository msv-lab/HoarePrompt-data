Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are elements of matrix `A`, `det` is the determinant of `A` which is not equal to 0, and `min_norm_value` is the minimum norm value based on specific conditions. If the absolute value of `a` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `b`, `c`, and `d`, then `min_norm_value` is `abs(a - (b * c / d))`. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0, `c_prime` is `(A[0][0] * A[1][1]) / A[0][1]`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(A[1][0] - c_prime)`. If `c` is 0, and `a` is not 0, `d_prime` is `b * c / a`, and `min_norm_value` is `abs(d - d_prime)`.***
