Output State: **a is A[0][0], b is A[0][1], c is A[1][0], d is A[1][1], det is not equal to 0, min_norm_value is abs(b - (a * d / c) if c != 0 else 0)**

Explanation:
1. The first line calculates `b_prime` using the formula \( b' = \frac{a \cdot d}{c} \) if `c` is not zero; otherwise, it sets `b_prime` to 0. Given the initial conditions where the absolute value of `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum of the absolute values of `a`, `c`, and `d`, and considering `c` is non-zero (as `det` is not equal to 0 and `abs(c)` is defined), `b_prime` is calculated as \( \frac{a \cdot d}{c} \).
2. The second line calculates `min_norm_value` as the absolute difference between `b` and `b_prime`, i.e., `min_norm_value = |b - b_prime|`.

Since the calculation of `b_prime` and `min_norm_value` do not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `det`, these variables retain their initial values.
