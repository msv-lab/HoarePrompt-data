The given code block involves reading two pairs of integers from user input, storing them in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, then creating a 2x2 matrix `A` using these values. After that, it calls a function `func_1` with the matrix `A` as an argument and prints the result formatted to 10 decimal places. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. 

Given the lack of the function's definition, we can still describe the final state of the variables based on the operations performed:

- The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the integers provided by the user.
- A 2x2 matrix `A` is created with `a` and `b` in the first row and `c` and `d` in the second row.
- The matrix `A` is passed to the undefined function `func_1`.
- The result of `func_1(A)` is printed with 10 decimal places.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot provide a numerical value for the result. Therefore, the final state will only include the updated values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, A is a 2x2 matrix with elements [a, b] and [c, d], result is the return value of func_1(A) formatted to 10 decimal places**
