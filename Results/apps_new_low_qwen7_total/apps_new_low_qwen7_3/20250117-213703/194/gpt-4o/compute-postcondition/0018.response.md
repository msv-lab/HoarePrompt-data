The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `A`, which is assumed to be a list of lists (a 2D list) containing integers. The integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements derived from `A` such that \(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d| \leq 10^9\).

The function returns either 0.0 or a calculated `min_norm_value` based on specific conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `A` (a 2D list of integers). It returns 0.0 or a calculated `min_norm_value` based on specific conditions involving the absolute values of integers derived from `A`.**
