Output State: **a is A[0][0], b is A[0][1], c is A[1][0], d is A[1][1], det is a * d - b * c, min_norm_value is abs(d - d_prime), d_prime is b * c / a if a != 0 else 0**

Explanation:
1. The condition `if a != 0` is checked. Given that `a` is the element `A[0][0]`, and the precondition states that `det is not equal to 0` (and `det = a * d - b * c`), it implies that `a` is not zero.
2. Therefore, `d_prime = b * c / a`.
3. Next, `min_norm_value = abs(d - d_prime)` is calculated. Given the values of `d` and `d_prime`, this line calculates the absolute difference between them.
4. No other variables are affected by the given code snippet.

Since `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `det` are unchanged and `min_norm_value` and `d_prime` are newly introduced, the final output state includes these updated variables based on the calculations performed.
