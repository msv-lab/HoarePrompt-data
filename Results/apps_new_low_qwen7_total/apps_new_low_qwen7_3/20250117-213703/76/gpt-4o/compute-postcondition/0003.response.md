Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements which are either `'.'` or `'*'`
   - `grid` now has one additional element appended to it (though this detail is not relevant to the loop head adjustment)
   - `index` is 1

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is an upper bound for the loop and does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Resulting State**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.

Final State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
