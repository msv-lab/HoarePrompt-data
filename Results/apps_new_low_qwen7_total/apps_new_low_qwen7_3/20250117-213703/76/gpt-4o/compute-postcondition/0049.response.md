The provided code block consists of two print statements. Let's analyze their effects on the variables and overall state:

1. The first print statement `print('YES')` does not modify any variables but prints 'YES' to the console.
2. The second print statement `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console. Given that `i` is initially `n - 1` and `j` is initially `m - 1`, after executing this line, it will print `n` and `m`.

Now, let's compile the final state:

- `total` remains unchanged at 0.
- `grid` remains unchanged as a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists.
- `index` remains unchanged at \( n \).
- `i` remains unchanged at \( n - 1 \).
- `row_walls` remains unchanged as a list of \( n \) integers.
- `col_walls` remains unchanged as a list of \( m \) integers.
- `total_walls` remains unchanged as the number of `'*'` in the grid.
- `j` remains unchanged at \( m - 1 \).

The output to the console will be 'YES' followed by `n` and `m` separated by a space.

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n - 1, row_walls is a list of n integers, col_walls is a list of m integers, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid, j is m - 1**
