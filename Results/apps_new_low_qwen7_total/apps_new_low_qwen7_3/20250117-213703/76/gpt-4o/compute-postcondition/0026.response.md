Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `j` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop in the given for loop statement. No other variables are modified or checked within the loop head itself.

2. **Current States**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists
   - `index` is \( n \)
   - `i` is \( n \)
   - `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones
   - `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones
   - `total_walls` is 1
   - `j` is \( m - 1 \)
   - The value of `grid[i][j]` is '*'

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than \( m \). Since `j` starts at \( m - 1 \), for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented and should become \( m \).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from \( m - 1 \) to \( m \).
   - Since `j` is now \( m \), the loop condition `j < m` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones, `total_walls` is 1, `j` is \( m \)**
