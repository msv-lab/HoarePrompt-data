You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the dimensions of the depot field. Following these, there are n lines, each containing m symbols "." and "*", representing the cells of the field where "." is an empty cell and "*" is a cell occupied by a wall.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])

m = int(data[1])

grid = []

index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: grid is a list of n+index lists, where the first n lists are the original content, and the last index lists are from data, index is n, i is n-1.
    row_walls = [0] * n

col_walls = [0] * m

total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding column, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m - 1 \).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the rows and columns of the grid.
    #   - For each cell `grid[i][j]`, if it contains '*', the corresponding row and column walls are incremented, and the total walls counter is incremented.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - **Invariant Variables**:
    #     - `index`: This remains constant as \( n \) throughout the loop.
    #     - `i`: This becomes \( n \) after the loop completes.
    #     - `j`: This starts at \( n-1 \) and increments until \( m-1 \). After the loop, `j` will be \( m-1 \).
    #   - **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
    #     - `row_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding row.
    #     - `col_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding column.
    #     - `total_walls`: This is incremented each time a '*' is found in the grid.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will execute for each '*’ in the grid. Therefore, the number of iterations is equal to the number of '*' in the grid.
    #   - After the loop, `i` will be \( n \) because it is only updated once the inner loop completes.
    #   - `j` will be \( m-1 \) after the inner loop completes.
    #   - `row_walls` and `col_walls` will contain the counts of '*' for each row and column, respectively.
    #   - `total_walls` will hold the total number of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the given output states. The loop correctly increments the wall counts and the total wall count based on the presence of '*'.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers containing the count of `'*'` in each row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers containing the count of `'*'` in each column, `total_walls` is the total number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is 0.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and either returns None or does not return any value based on certain conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: None

Case_2: The program does not return any value

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: None

Case_5: None

Case_6: The program returns None

Case_7: The program does not return any value

Case_8: NO value is returned

Case_9: None


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
