Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones with the last element being 2, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones with the last element being 2, `total_walls` is 2, `j` is \( m \). If `grid[i][j] == '*'`, then `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated such that the last elements are 2, and `total_walls` is set to 2. If `grid[i][j]` is not '*', no changes are made to these variables.***
