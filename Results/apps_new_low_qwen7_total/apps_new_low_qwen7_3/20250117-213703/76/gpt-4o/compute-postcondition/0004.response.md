Output State: **grid is [data[1]], index is 2** 

Explanation: 
- The initial state is `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the provided code).
- The first line `grid.append(data[index])` appends the element at the index `index` (which is 1) of the list `data` to the list `grid`. After this operation, `grid` becomes `[data[1]]`.
- The second line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1, making it 2.
- No other variables are affected by the provided code snippet.
