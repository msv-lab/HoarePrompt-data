Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n - 1, `row_walls` is a list where the element at index n - 1 is either 2 or 3 (depending on the value of `grid[i][j]`), `col_walls` is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 and the element at index 1 is 1, `total_walls` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 2. If `grid[i][j]` equals '*', `row_walls[n-1]` is set to 3 and `total_walls` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
