Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n integers where each integer is incremented by 1 twice (so each integer is 3), col_walls is a list of m integers where each integer is incremented by 1 twice (so each integer is 3), total_walls is 2, j is 3**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `row_walls` list by 1. Given that `i` is `n`, it increments the nth element of `row_walls` which was initially incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. Now, it is incremented by 1 again, making it 3.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the `col_walls` list by 1. Given that `j` is 3, it increments the third element of `col_walls` which was initially incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. Now, it is incremented by 1 again, making it 3.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the `total_walls` variable by 1, making it 1. It is then incremented by 1 again in this line, making `total_walls` equal to 2.
All other variables remain unchanged.
