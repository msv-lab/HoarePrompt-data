Postcondition: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding row, col_walls is a list of m integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding column, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid, j is 0. The current value of `grid[i][j]` is '*', meaning the cell at position (i, j) contains an '*' symbol.**
