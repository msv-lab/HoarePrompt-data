Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n - 1, `row_walls` is a list where the element at index n - 1 is 2 and all other elements are 0, `col_walls` is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 and the element at index 1 is 1, `total_walls` is 2, `j` is 1. If `grid[i][j]` is '*', `row_walls` at index n - 1 is set to 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
