Let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Initial State
- `total` is 0.
- `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists.
- `index` is \( n \).
- `i` is \( n \).
- `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers.
- `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers.
- `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid.
- `j` is \( m \).

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( m-1 \). For each iteration, it checks the condition:
\[ \text{row\_walls}[i] + \text{col\_walls}[j] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) == \text{total\_walls} \]

If the condition is true, the loop prints `i+1`, `j+1` and returns, thus exiting the loop. If the condition is false, the loop continues to the next iteration. Since `i` is initially set to `n` and the loop only depends on `j`, `i` will never change and will always be `n` during the loop's execution.

### Invariant Variables
- `total` remains 0 throughout the loop because the loop does not modify it.
- `grid` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- `index` remains \( n \) because the loop does not modify it.
- `i` remains \( n \) because the loop does not modify it.
- `row_walls` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- `col_walls` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- `total_walls` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- `j` increments from `m` down to 0.

### Loop Execution
The loop will continue to check the condition for each `j` until the condition is met. If the condition is never met, the loop will exit without changing any variables other than `j`.

### Final Output State
Since the loop exits when the condition is true, the final state of the variables will be such that the condition was met for some `j`. However, since the loop does not modify the variables and only checks the condition, the only variable that changes is `j`, which eventually reaches 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is 0.**
