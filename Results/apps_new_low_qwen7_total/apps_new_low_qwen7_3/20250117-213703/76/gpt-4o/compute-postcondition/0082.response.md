Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range `m`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition given is `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) != total_walls`. This condition determines whether the loop should continue.

3. **Determine the Change in `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `j_old`. For the next iteration, `j` will be `j_old + 1`. The other variables (`row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, `grid[i][j]`, and `total_walls`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are specified, they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `j` while keeping the other variables the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`row_walls[i]` is an integer, `col_walls[j + 1]` is an integer, `grid[i][j + 1]` can be either a string or not '*', `total_walls` is an integer**
