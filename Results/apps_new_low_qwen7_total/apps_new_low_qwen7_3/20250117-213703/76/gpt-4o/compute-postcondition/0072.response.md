The provided code block consists of two print statements:

1. `print('YES')`: This prints the string 'YES'.
2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`: This prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

From the initial state:
- `total` is 0,
- `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists,
- `index` is \( n \),
- `i` is \( n \),
- `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers,
- `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers,
- `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, and
- `j` is 2.

The code does not modify any of the variables `total`, `grid`, `index`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`, or `j`. It only prints 'YES' and then prints `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Since `i` is initially \( n \), `i + 1` will be \( n + 1 \). And since `j` is initially 2, `j + 1` will be 3.

Thus, the output will be:
- 'YES'
- \( n + 1 \) (printed as an integer)
- 3 (printed as an integer)

After running the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n integers, col_walls is a list of m integers, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid, and j is 3**
