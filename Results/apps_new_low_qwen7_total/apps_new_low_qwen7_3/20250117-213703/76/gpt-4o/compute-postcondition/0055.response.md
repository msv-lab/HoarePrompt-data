Postcondition: ***`total` remains 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n - 1 \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m \). If \( row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 \text{ if } grid[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) \) equals `total_walls`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, the program also does not return any value.***
