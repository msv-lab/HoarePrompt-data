Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding row incremented by 1, col_walls is a list of m integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding column incremented by 1, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid incremented by 1, j is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the count of '*' in the row corresponding to `i` by 1. Given that initially `row_walls` is a list of n integers representing the count of '*' in each row, and `i` is n, it means that the count for the nth row is incremented by 1.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the count of '*' in the column corresponding to `j` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, it means that the count for the 0th column is incremented by 1.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the total count of '*' in the grid by 1, so `total_walls` becomes the number of '*' in the grid plus 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.
