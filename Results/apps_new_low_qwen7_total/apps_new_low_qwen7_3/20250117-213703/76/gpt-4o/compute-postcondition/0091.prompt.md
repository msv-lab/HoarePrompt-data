Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding column, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m - 1 \).

Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the rows and columns of the grid.
   - For each cell `grid[i][j]`, if it contains '*', the corresponding row and column walls are incremented, and the total walls counter is incremented.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**:
     - `index`: This remains constant as \( n \) throughout the loop.
     - `i`: This becomes \( n \) after the loop completes.
     - `j`: This starts at \( n-1 \) and increments until \( m-1 \). After the loop, `j` will be \( m-1 \).
   - **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
     - `row_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding row.
     - `col_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding column.
     - `total_walls`: This is incremented each time a '*' is found in the grid.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute for each '*â€™ in the grid. Therefore, the number of iterations is equal to the number of '*' in the grid.
   - After the loop, `i` will be \( n \) because it is only updated once the inner loop completes.
   - `j` will be \( m-1 \) after the inner loop completes.
   - `row_walls` and `col_walls` will contain the counts of '*' for each row and column, respectively.
   - `total_walls` will hold the total number of '*' in the grid.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the given output states. The loop correctly increments the wall counts and the total wall count based on the presence of '*'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
            ) == total_walls:
            print('YES')
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            return


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n - 1 \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m \).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All iterations of the loop finish without executing any print statements.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
