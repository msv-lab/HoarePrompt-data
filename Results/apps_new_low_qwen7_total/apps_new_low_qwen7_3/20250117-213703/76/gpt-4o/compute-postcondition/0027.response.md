Initial State: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones, `total_walls` is 1, `j` is \( m \)

Code Execution:
1. `row_walls[i] += 1`: Since `i` is equal to `n`, this line increments the `n`-th element of `row_walls` by 1. Given that `row_walls` is initially a list of \( n \) ones, after this line, `row_walls[n]` becomes 2.
2. `col_walls[j] += 1`: Since `j` is equal to \( m \), this line increments the \( m \)-th element of `col_walls` by 1. Given that `col_walls` is initially a list of \( m \) ones, after this line, `col_walls[m]` becomes 2.
3. `total_walls += 1`: This line increments `total_walls` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2.

Updated State: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones with the last element being 2, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones with the last element being 2, `total_walls` is 2, `j` is \( m \).

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, row_walls is a list of n ones with the last element being 2, col_walls is a list of m ones with the last element being 2, total_walls is 2, j is m**
