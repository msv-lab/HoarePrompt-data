Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n - 1, row_walls is a list where the element at index n - 1 is 3 and all other elements are 0, col_walls is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 and the element at index 1 is 2, total_walls is 3, j is 2**

Explanation:
1. `row_walls[i] += 1`: The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and `row_walls[n - 1]` is initially 2. Adding 1 to it makes `row_walls[n - 1]` equal to 3.
2. `col_walls[j] += 1`: The value of `j` is 2, and `col_walls[2]` is not defined in the initial state, but since we only modify indices that exist, `col_walls[1]` (which is initially 1) is incremented to 2.
3. `total_walls += 1`: The value of `total_walls` is initially 2. Incrementing it by 1 makes `total_walls` equal to 3.
