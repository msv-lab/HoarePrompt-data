The loop head specifies the variable `j` as the iterating variable. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, `grid[i][j+1]`, and `total_walls` are integers.
- The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` was checked.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. So, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

State: **`row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j + 1]`, `grid[i][j + 2]`, and `total_walls` are integers. If `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j + 1] - (1 if grid[i][j + 1] == '*' else 0) == total_walls`, then no value is returned. Otherwise, no value is returned as well.**
