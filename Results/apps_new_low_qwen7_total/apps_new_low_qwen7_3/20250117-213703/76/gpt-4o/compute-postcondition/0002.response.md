The initial state is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements which are either '.' or '*'.

The provided code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `grid.append(data[index])`
2. `index += 1`

Let's analyze the effect of these lines:

- The first line appends the value at `data[index]` to the `grid` list. However, the `data` and `index` variables are not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we can only describe the action taken on the `grid` list, which is appending an element at the current index to it.
- The second line increments the value of `index` by 1. Again, since `index` is not defined, we can only say that its value is increased by 1.

Since we do not have specific values for `data` and `index`, we cannot provide a numerical or character-based value for the appended element. However, we know that the `grid` list will have one more element appended to it, and `index` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **i is 0, n is greater than 0, grid is a list of n lists, each containing m elements which are either '.' or '*', grid now has one additional element appended to it, index is 1**
