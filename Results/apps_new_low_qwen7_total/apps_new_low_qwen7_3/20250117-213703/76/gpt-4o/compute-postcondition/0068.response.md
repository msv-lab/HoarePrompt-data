The given code consists of two print statements:

1. `print('YES')`: This prints the string 'YES' to the console.
2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`: This prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console.

Let's break down the effects of these lines on the variables:

- The first line doesn't affect any variables.
- The second line adds 1 to the value of `i` and 1 to the value of `j` before printing them. Given the initial state where `i` is `n` and `j` is 1, after the second line executes, `i` becomes `n + 1` and `j` becomes 2.

Since `i` and `j` are the only variables that are modified by the code, we need to update their values in the final state. All other variables (`total`, `grid`, `index`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n + 1, j is 2, row_walls is a list of n integers, col_walls is a list of m integers, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid**
