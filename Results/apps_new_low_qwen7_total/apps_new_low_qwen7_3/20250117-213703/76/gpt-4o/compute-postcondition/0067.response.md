Let's analyze the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `total` is 0
- `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists
- `index` is \( n \)
- `i` is \( n \)
- `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers
- `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers
- `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid
- `j` is 0
- \( (row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 \text{ if } grid[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) \neq total_walls) \)

### Loop Head:
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( m-1 \).

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition checks if \( row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 \text{ if } grid[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) \neq total_walls \).

### Current Values:
- `i` is \( n \)
- `j` is 0

### Analysis:
1. The loop will execute as long as the condition \( row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 \text{ if } grid[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) \neq total_walls \) holds true.
2. Since `i` is \( n \) and `j` is 0, the current condition is checked using `row_walls[n] + col_walls[0] - (1 \text{ if } grid[n][0] == '*' \text{ else } 0) \neq total_walls`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `total` remains 0
- `grid` remains a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists
- `index` remains \( n \)
- `i` remains \( n \)
- `row_walls` remains a list of \( n \) integers
- `col_walls` remains a list of \( m \) integers
- `total_walls` remains the number of `'*'` in the grid
- `j` changes to 1

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is 1**
