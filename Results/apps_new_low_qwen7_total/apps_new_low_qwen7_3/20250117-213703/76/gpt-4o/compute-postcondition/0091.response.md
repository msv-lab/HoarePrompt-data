Output State: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers containing the count of `'*'` in each row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers containing the count of `'*'` in each column, `total_walls` is the total number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over the rows and columns of the grid.
   - For each cell `grid[i][j]`, the condition checks if the sum of the current row and column walls minus one (if the cell contains '*') equals the total number of walls.
   - If the condition is true, it prints the coordinates and exits the function.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**:
     - `index`: This remains constant as \( n \) throughout the loop.
     - `i`: This remains \( n \) after the loop completes.
     - `j`: This starts at \( m-1 \) and decrements until \( 0 \).
   - **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
     - `row_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding row.
     - `col_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding column.
     - `total_walls`: This is incremented each time a '*' is found in the grid.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute for each '*' in the grid.
   - The loop starts with `j` at \( m-1 \) and decrements until `j` reaches 0.
   - After the loop, `i` will be \( n \) because it is only updated once the inner loop completes.
   - `j` will be 0 after the inner loop completes.
   - `row_walls` and `col_walls` will contain the counts of '*' for each row and column, respectively.
   - `total_walls` will hold the total number of '*' in the grid.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the given output states. The loop correctly increments the wall counts and the total wall count based on the presence of '*'. The loop does not execute any print statements if the condition is never met, and it stops when `j` reaches 0.

The final values of all variables after the loop finishes are as described in the output state.
