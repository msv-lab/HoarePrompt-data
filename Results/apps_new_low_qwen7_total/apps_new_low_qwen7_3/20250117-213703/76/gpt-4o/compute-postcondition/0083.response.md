Output State: **row_walls[i] is an integer, col_walls[j + 1] is an integer, grid[i][j + 1] can be either a string or not '*', total_walls is an integer, print statement 'YES' executed, print statement 'i + 1 j + 1' executed**

Explanation:
The first line `print('YES')` executes and prints the string 'YES'. This does not modify any variables but affects the output.
The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` executes and prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. This also does not modify any variables but affects the output. The values of `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j + 1]`, `grid[i][j + 1]`, and `total_walls` remain unchanged from their initial states.
