Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + `index` lists, `index` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `row_walls` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding row incremented by 1, `col_walls` is a list of `m` integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding column incremented by 1, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid incremented by 1, `j` is 0. If `grid[i][j]` is `'*'`, then `row_walls` and `col_walls` are incremented by 1 and `total_walls` is incremented by 1.***
