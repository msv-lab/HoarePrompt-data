The given code block consists of two print statements:

1. `print('YES')`: This prints the string 'YES' to the console.
2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`: This prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console.

Let's analyze the variables involved:
- `total` is initially 0.
- `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, where `index` is \( n \). Therefore, `grid` is a list of \( 2n \) lists.
- `i` is \( n - 1 \).
- `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers.
- `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers.
- `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid.
- `j` is \( m + 1 \).

The code does not modify any of these variables or their relationships. The only operations performed are printing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Since `i` is \( n - 1 \) and `j` is \( m + 1 \), the values printed will be:
- `i + 1` is \( (n - 1) + 1 = n \)
- `j + 1` is \( (m + 1) + 1 = m + 2 \)

Thus, the output of the print statements will be:
- Line 1: 'YES'
- Line 2: `n` `m + 2`

Given the initial conditions, the final state includes the output from the print statements. The variables `total`, `grid`, `i`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of 2n lists, i is n - 1, row_walls is a list of n integers, col_walls is a list of m integers, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid, j is m + 1, the console displays 'YES', then n, followed by m + 2**
