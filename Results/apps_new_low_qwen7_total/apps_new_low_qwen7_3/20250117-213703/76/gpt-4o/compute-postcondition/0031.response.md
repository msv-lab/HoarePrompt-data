Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) ones with the last element being 3, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) ones with the last element being 3, `total_walls` is 3, `j` is \( m \). If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated accordingly to have their last elements as 3 and `total_walls` is incremented to 3. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
