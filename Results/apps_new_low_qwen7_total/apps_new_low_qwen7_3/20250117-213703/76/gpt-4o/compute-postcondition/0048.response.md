Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n - 1 \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m - 1 \). The condition \( \text{row\_walls}[i] + \text{col\_walls}[j] - (1 \text{ if } \text{grid}[i][j] == '*' \text{ else } 0) = \text{total\_walls} \) holds true.**
