Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of each line on the program.

Initial State: `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j + 1]`, `grid[i][j + 2]`, and `total_walls` are integers.

Code Snippet:
```python
if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j + 1] - (1 if grid[i][j + 1] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
    print('YES')
    print(i + 1, j + 1)
else:
    # This part is not executed as there is no statement here, so it does not change any variables.
```

Analysis:
1. The condition checks whether the expression `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j + 1] - (1 if grid[i][j + 1] == '*' else 0)` equals `total_walls`.
2. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES' followed by `i + 1` and `j + 1`.
3. If the condition is false, nothing happens, and no variables are modified.

Since the code block either prints 'YES' and two numbers or does nothing, we need to determine the outcome based on the condition. However, without specific values for `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j + 1]`, `grid[i][j + 1]`, and `total_walls`, we cannot definitively say whether the condition will be true or false. Therefore, the exact values of the variables after running this code snippet depend on the truth value of the condition.

Output State: **row_walls[i] is unchanged, col_walls[j + 1] is unchanged, grid[i][j + 2] is unchanged, total_walls is unchanged**. The output will be 'YES' and `i + 1` followed by `j + 1` if the condition is true; otherwise, nothing will be printed, and the variables will remain unchanged.
