The provided code block does not modify any variables or structures that were part of the initial state. Instead, it prints two lines of output without changing the values of `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `grid`, or `total_walls`.

Output State: **row_walls[i] is the number of walls in row i, col_walls[j] is the number of walls in column j, grid[i][j] is the value at position (i,j) in the grid (which can be either a wall or an empty space), total_walls is the total number of walls in the grid, and the sum of row_walls[i], col_walls[j], minus 1 if grid[i][j] is '*', equals total_walls.**

The lines `print('YES')` and `print(i + 1, j + 1)` print the specified text to the console but do not alter the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
