Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n, `row_walls` is a list of n ones (incremented when `grid[i][j] == '*'`), `col_walls` is a list of m ones (incremented when `grid[i][j] == '*'`), `total_walls` is 1 (incremented when `grid[i][j] == '*'`), `j` is m - 1, and the value of `grid[i][j]` is '*'***
