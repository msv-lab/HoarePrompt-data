The given code consists of two print statements. Let's analyze their effects on the variables and the overall state:

1. `print('YES')`: This line prints the string 'YES' to the console but does not modify any variables. It only outputs information.

2. `print(i + 1, j + 1)`: This line prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console. Again, it does not modify any variables but outputs information. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `m`, the printed values will be `n` and `m + 1` respectively.

Since the code does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state, the values of `total`, `grid`, `index`, `i`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition mentioned in the initial state `(row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) ≠ total_walls)` is also not evaluated or changed by the code, so it remains as stated in the initial state.

Therefore, the final output state includes the unchanged variables along with the printed statements:

Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, index is \( n \), i is \( n - 1 \), row_walls is a list of \( n \) integers, col_walls is a list of \( m \) integers, total_walls is the number of `'*'` in the grid, j is \( m \), (row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) ≠ total_walls), printed output is 'YES' and \( n \) \( m + 1 \)**
