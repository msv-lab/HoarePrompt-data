Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n - 1, `row_walls` is a list where the element at index n - 1 is 1 and all other elements are 0, `col_walls` is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 and all other elements are 0, `total_walls` is 1, `j` is 0. If `grid[i][j]` is '*', then `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated such that `row_walls[n-1]` is 1 and `col_walls[0]` is 1, and `total_walls` is 1. If `grid[i][j]` is not '*', the values remain unchanged.***
