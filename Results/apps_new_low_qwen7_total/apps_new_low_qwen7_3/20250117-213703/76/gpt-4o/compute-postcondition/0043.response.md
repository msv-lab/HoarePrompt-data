Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n, `row_walls` is a list of n integers where each integer is 3, `col_walls` is a list of m integers where each integer is 3, `total_walls` is 2, `j` is 3. If `grid[i][j]` is '*', `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated to contain integers incremented by 1 twice (each integer is 3), and `total_walls` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
