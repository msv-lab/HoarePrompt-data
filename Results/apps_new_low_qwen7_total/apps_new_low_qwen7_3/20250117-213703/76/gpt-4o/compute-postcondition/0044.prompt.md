Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists
   - `index` is \( n \)
   - `i` is \( n \)
   - `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding row
   - `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding column
   - `total_walls` is the number of '*' in the grid
   - `j` is \( m - 1 \)

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to \( n \).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently \( n \), it will not satisfy the condition `i < n` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to \( i = n + 1 \) to start the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.
   - `j` remains \( m - 1 \) as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The rest of the variables (`total`, `grid`, `index`, `row_walls`, `col_walls`, `total_walls`) do not change for the loop head conditions.

Thus, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i` to start the next iteration.

**State**: **`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n + 1 \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers where each integer represents the count of '*' in the corresponding column, `total_walls` is the number of '*' in the grid, `j` is \( m - 1 \)**
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if grid[i][j] == '*':
        row_walls[i] += 1
        col_walls[j] += 1
        total_walls += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + `index` lists, `index` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `row_walls` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding row incremented by 1, `col_walls` is a list of `m` integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding column incremented by 1, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid incremented by 1, `j` is 0. If `grid[i][j]` is `'*'`, then `row_walls` and `col_walls` are incremented by 1 and `total_walls` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n, `row_walls` is a list of n integers where each integer is incremented by 1, `col_walls` is a list of m integers where each integer is incremented by 1, `total_walls` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2. This occurs if and only if `grid[i][j]` is `'*'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`total` is 0, `grid` is a list of n + index lists, `index` is n, `i` is n, `row_walls` is a list of n integers where each integer is 3, `col_walls` is a list of m integers where each integer is 3, `total_walls` is 2, `j` is 3. If `grid[i][j]` is '*', `row_walls` and `col_walls` are updated to contain integers incremented by 1 twice (each integer is 3), and `total_walls` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
