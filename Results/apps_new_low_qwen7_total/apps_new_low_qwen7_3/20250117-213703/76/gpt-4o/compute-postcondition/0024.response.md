Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n ones (since row_walls[i] was incremented), col_walls is a list of m ones (since col_walls[j] was incremented), total_walls is 1 (since total_walls was incremented), j is m - 1, the value of grid[i][j] is '*'**

Explanation:
- The first line `row_walls[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `row_walls` list by 1. Given that `i` is `n`, and initially `row_walls` is a list of `n` zeros, it becomes a list of `n` ones.
- The second line `col_walls[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the `col_walls` list by 1. Given that `j` is `m - 1`, and initially `col_walls` is a list of `m` zeros, it becomes a list of `m` ones.
- The third line `total_walls += 1` increments the `total_walls` variable by 1, making it equal to 1.
