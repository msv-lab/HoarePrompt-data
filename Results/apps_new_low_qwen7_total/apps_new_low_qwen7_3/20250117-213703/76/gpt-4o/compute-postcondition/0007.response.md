Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over `range(n)` and appends `data[index]` to the `grid` list for each iteration. After appending, the `index` variable is incremented by 1.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Grid**: Initially, `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` elements, either `'.'` or `'*'`. After each iteration, an element from `data` is appended to `grid`, so the length of `grid` increases by 1 per iteration.
- **Index**: This variable starts from 0 and increments by 1 after each append operation.
- **i**: This variable is used in the loop and increases by 1 after each iteration. However, its value is only relevant within the loop itself and is not needed outside the loop to determine the final state.
- **n**: The number of rows (`n`) remains constant throughout the loop and does not change.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

- **Final Value of Grid**: The `grid` will end up with `n + index` rows, where the last `index` rows are filled with elements from `data`.
- **Final Value of Index**: The `index` will be `n + k - 1` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed.
- **Final Value of i**: The `i` variable is not needed to determine the final state, but it will be equal to `n - 1` after the loop finishes.
- **Conditions**: The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `index` is at least `n` before starting the loop. If `index < n`, the loop will execute until `index` reaches `n`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the given outputs:
- After 1 iteration: `grid` has one additional element, `index` is 1.
- After 2 iterations: `grid` is `[data[1]]`, `index` is 2.
- After 3 iterations: `grid` is `[data[1], data[3]]`, `i` is 4, `index` is 4, `n` must be greater than 2.

These observations confirm that the loop appends elements from `data` to `grid` until `index` equals `n`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be:
- `grid` will contain `n + index` elements, where the last `index` elements are from `data`.
- `index` will be equal to `n`.
- `i` will be `n - 1`.

Output State: **grid is a list of n+index lists, where the first n lists are the original content, and the last index lists are from data, index is n, i is n-1.**
