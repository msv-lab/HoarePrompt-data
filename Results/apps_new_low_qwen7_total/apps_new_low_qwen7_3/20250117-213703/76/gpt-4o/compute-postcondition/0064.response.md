Output State: **total is 0, grid is a list of n + index lists, index is n, i is n, row_walls is a list of n integers, col_walls is a list of m integers, total_walls is the number of '*' in the grid, j is 1, print statement executed with output 'YES' and 'n + 1, 1'**

Explanation:
1. The first line `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console.
2. The second line `print(i + 1, j + 1)` prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the console. Given that `i` is `n` and `j` is `0`, the values printed will be `n + 1` and `1` respectively.

The code does not modify any of the existing variables or introduce new ones. It only performs print operations and updates the value of `j` from `0` to `1`. Therefore, the updated value of `j` is included in the final state, while the values of other variables remain unchanged.
