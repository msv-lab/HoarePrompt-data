Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `grid` is `[data[1]]`, `index` is `2`.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is an input or a previously defined variable that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 (since `index` was 2).
   - Therefore, the loop has already executed 2 times, and now it is about to start the third iteration.

3. **Update the Loop Counter (`i`)**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - So, `i` will be `3`.

4. **Check Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, and we don't know the exact value of `n`, the loop will execute if `n > 2`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted within the loop head is `i`.
   - `i` will be set to 3 for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`grid` and `index`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State
- `i` is set to 3.
- `n` must still satisfy the condition `n > 2` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`grid` is `[data[1]]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**.
