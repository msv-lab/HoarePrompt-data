Functionality: **The function reads a grid of characters representing a depot field from standard input, where '.' represents an empty cell and '*' represents a cell occupied by a wall. It then calculates the number of walls in each row and column and the total number of walls. The function checks if for each cell in the grid, the sum of the number of walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input grid is empty (n or m is 0), the function will still process the input but will not find any walls since there are no cells.
- If the input grid does not contain any walls ('*'), the function will also print 'NO' as no cell satisfies the condition.
- The function assumes that the input is valid and follows the specified format (n and m are positive integers, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the grid is a valid representation of n rows and m columns).

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no handling for invalid input formats. For example, if the input does not follow the specified format (e.g., non-integer values for n or m, or mismatched dimensions of the grid), the function will raise an error. However, the problem statement and annotations do not specify any input validation, so the function will rely on the correctness of the input provided by the user.
