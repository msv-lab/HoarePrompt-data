Postcondition: **`row_walls[i]` is the number of walls in row `i`, `col_walls[j]` is the number of walls in column `j`, `grid[i][j]` is the value at position `(i,j)` in the grid (which can be either a wall or an empty space), `total_walls` is the total number of walls in the grid, and the sum of `row_walls[i]`, `col_walls[j]`, minus 1 if `grid[i][j]` is '*', equals `total_walls`.**
