Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It then iterates through the grid to count the number of walls in each row and column.
3. The program calculates the total number of walls.
4. It checks for each cell if placing the bomb there would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by ensuring that the sum of walls in the corresponding row and column minus the wall at that cell (if it exists) equals the total number of walls.
5. If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates and exits.
6. If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

Given this analysis, the provided program logic appears to match the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing the bomb in an appropriate location.

Correctness: **True**
