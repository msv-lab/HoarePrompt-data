### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Walls in Rows and Columns:**
   - The program correctly iterates through the grid to count the number of walls in each row and column, and calculates the total number of walls. This part is also correct.

3. **Checking for Valid Bomb Placement:**
   - The critical part of the program checks if placing the bomb in any cell would result in all walls being wiped out. The condition used is:
     ```python
     if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
     ```
   - Let's analyze this condition:
     - `row_walls[i]` is the number of walls in row `i`.
     - `col_walls[j]` is the number of walls in column `j`.
     - `(1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0)` subtracts one if the cell `(i, j)` is a wall, because we don't want to double-count the wall at `(i, j)` when it is already included in both `row_walls[i]` and `col_walls[j]`.

   - The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` ensures that the sum of walls in row `i` and column `j` (minus the wall at `(i, j)` if present) equals the total number of walls. This is mathematically equivalent to checking if placing the bomb at `(i, j)` would result in all walls being wiped out.

4. **Output:**
   - If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates and exits. If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".
   - The output handling is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program logic matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program accurately determines whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing the bomb in an appropriate location.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
