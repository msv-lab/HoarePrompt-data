Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
2. **Grid Construction**: The grid is constructed properly from the input string, and the dimensions of the grid are captured correctly.
3. **Wall Count Calculation**: The code calculates the number of walls in each row and column correctly. This is done by iterating through the grid and incrementing the respective row and column counters whenever a wall (`'*'`) is encountered.
4. **Verification Logic**: The verification logic checks if the sum of the number of walls in a row and a column, minus one if the cell itself is a wall, equals the total number of walls. This ensures that wiping out all walls by placing the bomb in that cell is possible.

Given the above points, the code logic appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
