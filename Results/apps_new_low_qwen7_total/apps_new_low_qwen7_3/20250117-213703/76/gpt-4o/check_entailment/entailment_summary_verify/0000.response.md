Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to validate the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if it is possible to wipe out all walls in a depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The key points are:
1. The bomb can be placed in any cell (empty or wall).
2. Placing the bomb at cell \((x, y)\) will remove all walls in row \(x\) and column \(y\).
3. We need to check if there exists a cell \((x, y)\) such that removing the walls in row \(x\) and column \(y\) results in all walls being removed.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program `func_1` does the following:
1. Reads the grid dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) and the grid itself.
2. Calculates the number of walls in each row and column.
3. Iterates through each cell to check if placing the bomb at that cell would result in all walls being removed.

The core logic of the program is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
            print('YES')
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            return
```

This condition checks if the sum of walls in the row and column of the current cell, minus one if the cell itself is a wall, equals the total number of walls. If this condition holds true for any cell, the program prints "YES" and the coordinates of that cell.

### Validation of the Original Assessment

#### Correctness of the Program Logic

1. **Row and Column Counts**: The program correctly counts the number of walls in each row and column.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` ensures that if the bomb is placed at \((i, j)\), all walls will be removed.
   - If `grid[i][j]` is a wall (`'*'`), subtracting 1 accounts for the fact that the cell itself will be cleared.
   - If `grid[i][j]` is empty (`'.'`), no subtraction is needed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the bomb is placed in either an empty cell or a wall cell correctly. It checks if placing the bomb at any cell results in all walls being removed.

#### Specific Test Case Analysis

Consider the input:
```
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

- Row 1 has 0 walls.
- Row 2 has 1 wall.
- Row 3 has 1 wall.
- Column 1 has 1 wall.
- Column 2 has 1 wall.
- Column 3 has 1 wall.

Total walls = 4.

Checking each cell:
- Cell (1,1): `0 + 1 - 1 = 0`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (1,2): `0 + 1 - 0 = 1`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (1,3): `0 + 1 - 0 = 1`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (2,1): `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (2,2): `1 + 1 - 1 = 1`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (2,3): `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (3,1): `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (3,2): `1 + 1 - 1 = 1`, not equal to 4.
- Cell (3,3): `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, not equal to 4.

Since none of the cells satisfy the condition, the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
