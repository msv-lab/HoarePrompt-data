You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
    print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a grid of characters representing a depot field from standard input, where '.' represents an empty cell and '*' represents a cell occupied by a wall. It then calculates the number of walls in each row and column and the total number of walls. The function checks if for each cell in the grid, the sum of the number of walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. Specifically, the program checks if placing the bomb at position \((i, j)\) would result in wiping out all walls, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cell \((i, j)\) itself might be a wall. 

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

In this case, the program should output "NO" because placing the bomb at any position cannot wipe out all walls. However, the current implementation may incorrectly output "YES" for certain positions, leading to a wrong solution. This is because the logic to check if placing the bomb at \((i, j)\) results in wiping out all walls does not account for the possibility that the bomb itself could be a wall and still not result in the desired outcome.

Here’s a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

```
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

The program will incorrectly output "YES" for some positions, failing to recognize that no single position can wipe out all walls. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
