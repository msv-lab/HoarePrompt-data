You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    grid = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        grid.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    row_walls = [0] * n
    col_walls = [0] * m
    total_walls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                row_walls[i] += 1
                col_walls[j] += 1
                total_walls += 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)
                return
    print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a grid of characters representing a depot field from standard input, where '.' represents an empty cell and '*' represents a cell occupied by a wall. It then calculates the number of walls in each row and column and the total number of walls. The function checks if for each cell in the grid, the sum of the number of walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls. If such a cell is found, the function prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the cell (1-indexed) and returns. If no such cell is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It then iterates through the grid to count the number of walls in each row and column.
3. The program calculates the total number of walls.
4. It checks for each cell if placing the bomb there would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by ensuring that the sum of walls in the corresponding row and column minus the wall at that cell (if it exists) equals the total number of walls.
5. If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates and exits.
6. If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

Given this analysis, the provided program logic appears to match the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing the bomb in an appropriate location.
