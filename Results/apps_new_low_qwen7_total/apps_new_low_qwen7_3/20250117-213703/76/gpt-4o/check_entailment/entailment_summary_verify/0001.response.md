### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into components.
   - It initializes the grid and calculates the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The grid is stored as a list of strings.

2. **Counting Walls:**
   - It correctly initializes lists `row_walls` and `col_walls` to store the number of walls in each row and column.
   - It iterates through the grid to count the number of walls in each row and column and updates the `total_walls`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - For each cell in the grid, it checks if placing the bomb at that cell would result in all walls being wiped out.
   - The condition checked is if the sum of walls in the row and column minus one (if the cell itself is a wall) equals the total number of walls.
   - If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates and exits.
   - If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

However, there is a potential issue with the condition used to determine if the bomb can wipe out all walls. The condition `row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0) == total_walls` is almost correct but needs a slight adjustment. Specifically, it should be:

\[ \text{row\_walls}[i] + \text{col\_walls}[j] - (\text{grid}[i][j] == '*') == \text{total\_walls} \]

This ensures that the condition correctly accounts for the wall at the current cell if it exists.

To validate this, let's consider the examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```
   Input:
   3 4
   .*
   ..
   .*

   Output:
   YES
   1 2
   ```

   - Row 1 has 1 wall, Column 2 has 1 wall, Total walls = 1.
   - Placing the bomb at (1, 2) wipes out the wall in Row 1 and Column 2, so the condition holds true.

2. **Example 2:**
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   ..*
   .*.
   *..

   Output:
   NO
   ```

   - Row 1 has 1 wall, Row 2 has 1 wall, Row 3 has 1 wall.
   - Column 1 has 1 wall, Column 2 has 1 wall, Column 3 has 1 wall.
   - Total walls = 6.
   - No single cell satisfies the condition where the sum of walls in its row and column minus one (if the cell is a wall) equals 6.

3. **Example 3:**
   ```
   Input:
   6 5
   ..*..
   ..*..
   *****
   ..*..
   ..*..
   ..*..

   Output:
   YES
   3 3
   ```

   - Row 3 has 4 walls, Column 3 has 4 walls, Total walls = 20.
   - Placing the bomb at (3, 3) wipes out the walls in Row 3 and Column 3, so the condition holds true.

Given these examples and the logic in the program, the condition is correctly implemented, and the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb.
