Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. Specifically, the program checks if placing the bomb at position \((i, j)\) would result in wiping out all walls, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cell \((i, j)\) itself might be a wall. 

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

In this case, the program should output "NO" because placing the bomb at any position cannot wipe out all walls. However, the current implementation may incorrectly output "YES" for certain positions, leading to a wrong solution. This is because the logic to check if placing the bomb at \((i, j)\) results in wiping out all walls does not account for the possibility that the bomb itself could be a wall and still not result in the desired outcome.

Hereâ€™s a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

```
3 3
..*
.*.
*..
```

The program will incorrectly output "YES" for some positions, failing to recognize that no single position can wipe out all walls. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
