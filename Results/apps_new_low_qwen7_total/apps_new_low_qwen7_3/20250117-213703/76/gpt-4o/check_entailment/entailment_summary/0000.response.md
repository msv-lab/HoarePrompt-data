Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid, and then reads the grid itself into a list of strings (`grid`).

2. **Counting Walls**: It initializes two lists, `row_walls` and `col_walls`, to count the number of walls in each row and column, respectively. It also keeps a running total of the number of walls, `total_walls`.

3. **Checking Possibility**: For each cell in the grid, it checks if the sum of the number of walls in its row and column, minus one if the cell itself is a wall, equals the total number of walls. This calculation determines if the current cell could be the location of the bomb that would wipe out all walls.

4. **Output**: If such a cell is found, the program prints 'YES' followed by the 1-indexed coordinates of the cell and returns. If no such cell is found, the program prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program seems to follow the required logic accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
