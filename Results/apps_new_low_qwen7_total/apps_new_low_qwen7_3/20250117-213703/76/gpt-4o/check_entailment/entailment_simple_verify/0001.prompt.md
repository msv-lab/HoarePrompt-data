You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a description of a depot. It is a rectangular checkered field of n × m size. Each cell in a field can be empty (".") or it can be occupied by a wall ("*"). 

You have one bomb. If you lay the bomb at the cell (x, y), then after triggering it will wipe out all walls in the row x and all walls in the column y.

You are to determine if it is possible to wipe out all walls in the depot by placing and triggering exactly one bomb. The bomb can be laid both in an empty cell or in a cell occupied by a wall.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field. 

The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `total` is 0, `grid` is a list of \( n + \text{index} \) lists, `index` is \( n \), `i` is \( n \), `row_walls` is a list of \( n \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding row, `col_walls` is a list of \( m \) integers where each integer represents the count of `'*'` in the corresponding column, `total_walls` is the number of `'*'` in the grid, `j` is \( m - 1 \).
    #
    #Explanation:
    #1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the rows and columns of the grid.
    #   - For each cell `grid[i][j]`, if it contains '*', the corresponding row and column walls are incremented, and the total walls counter is incremented.
    #
    #2. **Track Variable Changes**:
    #   - **Invariant Variables**:
    #     - `index`: This remains constant as \( n \) throughout the loop.
    #     - `i`: This becomes \( n \) after the loop completes.
    #     - `j`: This starts at \( n-1 \) and increments until \( m-1 \). After the loop, `j` will be \( m-1 \).
    #   - **Variables Updated During the Loop**:
    #     - `row_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding row.
    #     - `col_walls`: Each element in this list is incremented based on the number of '*' in the corresponding column.
    #     - `total_walls`: This is incremented each time a '*' is found in the grid.
    #
    #3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop will execute for each '*’ in the grid. Therefore, the number of iterations is equal to the number of '*' in the grid.
    #   - After the loop, `i` will be \( n \) because it is only updated once the inner loop completes.
    #   - `j` will be \( m-1 \) after the inner loop completes.
    #   - `row_walls` and `col_walls` will contain the counts of '*' for each row and column, respectively.
    #   - `total_walls` will hold the total number of '*' in the grid.
    #
    #4. **Verify Relationships**:
    #   - The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the given output states. The loop correctly increments the wall counts and the total wall count based on the presence of '*'.

        for j in range(m):
            if row_walls[i] + col_walls[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == '*' else 0
                ) == total_walls:
                print('YES')
                print(i + 1, j + 1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It then iterates through the grid to count the number of walls in each row and column.
3. The program calculates the total number of walls.
4. It checks for each cell if placing the bomb there would result in all walls being wiped out. This is done by ensuring that the sum of walls in the corresponding row and column minus the wall at that cell (if it exists) equals the total number of walls.
5. If such a cell is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates and exits.
6. If no such cell is found, the program prints "NO".

Given this analysis, the provided program logic appears to match the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to wipe out all walls by placing the bomb in an appropriate location.
