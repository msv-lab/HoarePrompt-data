You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton is playing a very interesting computer game, but now he is stuck at one of the levels. To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.

Anton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. 

Anton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.

Anton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.

The second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.

The third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.

The fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.

There are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.

The sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type. It's guaranteed that d_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. d_{i} ≤ d_{j} if i < j.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum time one has to spent in order to prepare n potions.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80

Output
20

Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
200 100 400
4 15
100 800

Output
200



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the optimum answer is to use the second spell of the first type that costs 10 manapoints. Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).

In the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It returns the minimum value among `n * x` and `max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]` for all `i` and `j` where `b[i] <= s` and `d[j] <= s - b[i]`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Initializes `min_time` to `n * x`.
2. Iterates over the list `d` and updates `min_time` if `d[i] <= s`, calculating `time_with_spell = max(0, n - c[i]) * x`.
3. Iterates over the list `b` and updates `min_time` if `b[i] <= s`, calculating `time_with_spell = n * a[i]`.
4. Iterates over the list `d` again, considering the remaining manapoints `s - b[i]` and updates `min_time` if `d[j] <= s - b[i]`, calculating `time_with_both_spells = max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `k = 0`, the second loop will not execute, and `min_time` will remain as `n * x`.
- If `m = 0`, the third loop will not execute, and `min_time` will remain as the value updated in the first two loops.
- If no values of `d[i]` satisfy `d[i] <= s` or `d[j] <= s - b[i]`, `min_time` will still be the initial value `n * x`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `min_time` holds the minimum value among `n * x` and `max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]` for all `i` and `j` where `b[i] <= s` and `d[j] <= s - b[i]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where using both types of spells simultaneously results in a lower total preparation time. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the scenario where the first spell changes the preparation time and the second spell reduces the number of potions that need to be prepared. This oversight can lead to an incorrect minimum time calculation.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80
```

- Using only the first spell (index 1) would change the preparation time to 4 seconds for all 20 potions, resulting in \(20 \times 4 = 80\) seconds.
- Using only the second spell (index 0) would immediately prepare 4 potions, leaving 16 potions to be prepared at 10 seconds each, resulting in \(16 \times 10 = 160\) seconds plus the 20 seconds for the 4 potions, totaling 180 seconds.
- Using both spells (index 1 of the first type and index 0 of the second type) would change the preparation time to 4 seconds for the remaining 16 potions after preparing 4 potions instantly, resulting in \(16 \times 4 = 64\) seconds.

The correct minimum time is 64 seconds, but the current implementation might not correctly compute this scenario due to its limitations in combining the effects of both types of spells.
