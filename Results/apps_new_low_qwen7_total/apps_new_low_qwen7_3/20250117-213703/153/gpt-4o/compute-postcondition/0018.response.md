Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2×10^5. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then the conditions `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a constant, `a` is a list, `time_with_spell` is 100, and `min_time` is 100 hold true. Since there is no else part, these conditions remain unchanged regardless of the if condition outcome.***
