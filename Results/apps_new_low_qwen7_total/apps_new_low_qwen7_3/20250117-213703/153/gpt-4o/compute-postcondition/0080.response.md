The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `m`: a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `x`: a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `s`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `a`: a list of \(m\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i < x\).
- `b`: a list of \(m\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `c`: a list of \(k\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the list is non-decreasing.
- `d`: a list of \(k\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq d_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and the list is non-decreasing.

The function calculates and returns `min_time`, which is the minimum value among \(n \cdot x\) and \(\max(0, n - c[j]) \cdot a[i]\) for all \(i\) and \(j\) where \(b[i] \leq s\) and \(d[j] \leq s - b[i]\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (non-negative integers), x, s (positive integers), and lists a, b, c, d with specific constraints. It returns the minimum value among n * x and max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i] for all i and j where b[i] <= s and d[j] <= s - b[i].**
