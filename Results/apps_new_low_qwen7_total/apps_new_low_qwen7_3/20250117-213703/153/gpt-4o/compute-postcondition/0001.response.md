Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variables**:
   - The loop is controlled by the variable `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by `range(k)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `k-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

3. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - Since `i` starts at 0, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`min_time`, `n`, `x`, `m`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) are not directly involved in controlling the loop execution but may affect the loop body's behavior.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, the only variable that must be in a specific state is `i`. Specifically, `i` must be 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
