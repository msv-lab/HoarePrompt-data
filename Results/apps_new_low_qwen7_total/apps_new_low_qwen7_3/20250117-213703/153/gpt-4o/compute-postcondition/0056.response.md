The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or match statement, which is not present in the given code. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`d[k]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, and `min_time` is an integer.**
