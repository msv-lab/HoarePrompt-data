Postcondition: ***`d[j]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, `min_time` is an integer. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is decremented by 1, `time_with_both_spells` is updated accordingly, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the loops or conditionals are exited, and the values remain unchanged.***
