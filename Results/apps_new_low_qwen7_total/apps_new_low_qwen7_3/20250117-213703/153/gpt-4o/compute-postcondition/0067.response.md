Postcondition: **`i` is \(k + 2\), `m` is the same as before, `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\), and `k` must be at least 1. If `d[j] \leq remaining_manapoints` for some `j` where `0 \leq j < k`, then `j` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated. If `d[j] > remaining_manapoints` for all `j` where `0 \leq j < k`, then the most internal loop or block is broken out of.**
