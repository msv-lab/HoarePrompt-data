Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variable `min_time`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `min_time` is `n * x`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `a` is a list of m positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < x.
   - `b` is a list of m positive integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 2·10^9.
   - `c` is a list of k positive integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and c_i are non-decreasing.
   - `d` is a list of k positive integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2·10^9 and d_i are non-decreasing.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.
   - Inside the loop, there is a condition `if d[i] <= s:`.
     - If the condition is true, `remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])` is calculated.
     - Then, `time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x` is computed.
     - Finally, `min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)` updates `min_time` to the minimum value between its current value and `time_with_spell`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After all iterations, `min_time` will be the minimum value among `min_time` and `time_with_spell` for all `i` where `d[i] <= s`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `x`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged as they are not updated inside the loop.

4. **Conditions**:
   - The loop executes `k` times if `k > 0`.
   - If `k = 0`, the loop does not execute at all, and `min_time` remains as `n * x`.

### Output State After the Loop Finishes

- **Variables**:
  - `n`, `x`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain constant.
  - `min_time` is updated to the minimum value among `min_time` and `time_with_spell` for all `i` where `d[i] <= s`.

- **Final Output State**:
  - **min_time**: The minimum value between the initial `n * x` and `time_with_spell` for all `i` where `d[i] <= s`.

**Output State: min_time is the minimum value among `n * x` and `max(0, n - c[i]) * x` for all `i` where `d[i] <= s`.**
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] <= s:
        time_with_spell = n * a[i]
        min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, and `min_time` is the minimum value between the initial `min_time` (undefined) and `time_with_spell` (which is `n * a[0]`).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`i` is 1 and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2×10^5. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then the conditions `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a constant, `a` is a list, `time_with_spell` is 100, and `min_time` is 100 hold true. Since there is no else part, these conditions remain unchanged regardless of the if condition outcome.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 < m \leq 2 \times 10^5\). If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its initial value (assumed to be very large) and `n * a[2]`, where `n` is undefined. Otherwise, `min_time` remains unchanged.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
