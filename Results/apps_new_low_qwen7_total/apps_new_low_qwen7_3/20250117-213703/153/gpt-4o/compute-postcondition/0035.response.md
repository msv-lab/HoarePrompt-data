Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `d` is a list of `k` positive integers, `d[0]` is defined and valid, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[0]`, and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `s`. If `d[j]` (which is `d[1]`) is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[1])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[0]`, and `min_time` is `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time`.***
