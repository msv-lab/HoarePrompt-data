Postcondition: ***`i` is \(k + 2\), `m` is the same as before, `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\), `k` is unchanged, `j` is \(j + 1\), `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `remaining_potions` is \(\max(0, n - c[j + 1])\). If `d[j] <= remaining_manapoints`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]` and `min_time` is the minimum value between the old `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, `time_with_both_spells` remains unchanged and `min_time` remains unchanged. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
