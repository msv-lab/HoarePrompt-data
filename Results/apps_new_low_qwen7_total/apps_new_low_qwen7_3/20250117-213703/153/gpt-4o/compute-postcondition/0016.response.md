The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.

Since `i` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should become 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The value of `m` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2×10^5**
