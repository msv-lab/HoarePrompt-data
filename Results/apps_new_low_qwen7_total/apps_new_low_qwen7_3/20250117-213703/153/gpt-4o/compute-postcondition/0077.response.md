Postcondition: ***`i` is \(k + 2\), `m` remains the same, `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\) if `b[i] <= s`, `k` remains the same, `j` is \(k\), `n` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `remaining_potions` is \(\max(0, n - c[k])\), `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]` if `d[k] \leq remaining_manapoints` and otherwise remains unchanged, `min_time` is the minimum value between the initial `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells` if `d[k] \leq remaining_manapoints` and otherwise remains unchanged.***
