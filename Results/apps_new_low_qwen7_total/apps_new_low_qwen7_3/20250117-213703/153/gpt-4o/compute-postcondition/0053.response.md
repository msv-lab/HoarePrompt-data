Postcondition: ***`d[j+1]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, and `min_time` is an integer. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` and `time_with_both_spells` may be updated, and `min_time` may also be updated. Otherwise, the loops or statements inside the else part will be executed, ensuring that `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time` retain their original values, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
