Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[0])`, `time_with_spell` is `max(0, n - c[0]) * x`, and `min_time` is `min(min_time, max(0, n - c[0]) * x)`. Otherwise, the values of `remaining_potions`, `time_with_spell`, and `min_time` remain unchanged.***
