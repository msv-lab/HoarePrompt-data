Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `d` is a list of k positive integers, `d[0]` is defined and valid, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[0]`, and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `s`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `min_time` is 0, and `n`, `c`, and `a` are not specified. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
