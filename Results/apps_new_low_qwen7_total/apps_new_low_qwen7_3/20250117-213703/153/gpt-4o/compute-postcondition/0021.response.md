Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 < m \leq 2 \times 10^5\). If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its initial value (assumed to be very large) and `n * a[2]`, where `n` is undefined. Otherwise, `min_time` remains unchanged.***
