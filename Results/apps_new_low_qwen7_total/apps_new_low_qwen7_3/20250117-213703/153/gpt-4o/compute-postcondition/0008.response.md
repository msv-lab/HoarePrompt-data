The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Additionally, `k` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 2
- `k` must still be greater than 1

State: **`i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 1**
