The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is \(k + 2\), `m` is the same as before, `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\), `k` is unchanged, `j` is \(j + 1\), `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `remaining_potions` is \(\max(0, n - c[j + 1])\), `time_with_both_spells` is either `remaining_potions * a[i]` if `d[j + 1] <= remaining_manapoints` or unchanged, `min_time` is either the minimum value between the old `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells` if `d[j + 1] <= remaining_manapoints` or unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
