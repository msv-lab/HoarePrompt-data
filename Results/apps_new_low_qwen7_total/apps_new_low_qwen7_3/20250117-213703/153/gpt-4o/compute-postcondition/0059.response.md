Postcondition: ***`i = k + 1`, `j = k`, `d` is a list of `k` positive integers, `b` is a list, `s` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, and `min_time` is an integer. For each `j` from `k-1` down to `0` where `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_manapoints` is reduced by `b[j+1]` and `min_time` is updated accordingly.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts (although the else part does not change the state).
