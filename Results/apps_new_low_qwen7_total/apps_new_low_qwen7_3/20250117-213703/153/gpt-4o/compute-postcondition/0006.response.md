Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `k` must be greater than 1 (though `k` itself is not used in the provided code block)
- `d[1]` is less than or equal to `s` (the condition is not directly given, but we can infer based on the subsequent assignment statements)
- `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[1])`
- `time_with_spell` is `max(0, n - c[1]) * x`
- `min_time` is `min(min_time, max(0, n - c[1]) * x)`

The code block provided:
```python
remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])
time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x
min_time = min(min_time, time_with_potions * x)
```

Let's break down the execution of these lines:

1. The first line `remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])` updates `remaining_potions` to `max(0, n - c[1])`. Given that `d[1]` is less than or equal to `s`, it implies that `c[1]` is also a valid value and `n - c[1]` will be non-negative. Therefore, `remaining_potions` will be `n - c[1]`.

2. The second line `time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x` updates `time_with_spell` to `(n - c[1]) * x`.

3. The third line `min_time = min(min_time, time_with_potions * x)` updates `min_time` to `min(min_time, (n - c[1]) * x)`. If `min_time` was already initialized (which would be necessary for this line to work), it gets updated to the minimum of its current value and `(n - c[1]) * x`.

Given that no values of `n`, `c`, `x`, `min_time`, or any other variables are provided, let's assume they are as follows for the sake of providing a concrete example:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `c` is a list where `c[1]` is a positive integer less than `n`
- `x` is a positive integer
- `min_time` is initialized to some positive integer

For simplicity, let's assume:
- `n` is 10
- `c[1]` is 5
- `x` is 2
- `min_time` is 10 (just an arbitrary value to illustrate the calculation)

Then:
- `remaining_potions` becomes `max(0, 10 - 5) = 5`
- `time_with_spell` becomes `5 * 2 = 10`
- `min_time` becomes `min(10, 10) = 10`

Since `min_time` is already 10, it does not change in this case, but generally, if `min_time` were larger than 10, it would get updated to 10.

Final state:
Output State: **i is 1, k is greater than 1, remaining_potions is 5, time_with_spell is 10, min_time is 10**
