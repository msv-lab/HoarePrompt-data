Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\)

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < m`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

Given that `i` is currently 2 and it needs to be less than `m` for the loop to continue, `m` must still be within its original range, and it must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `i` is 2
- `m` remains a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(m > 2\).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 < m \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**
