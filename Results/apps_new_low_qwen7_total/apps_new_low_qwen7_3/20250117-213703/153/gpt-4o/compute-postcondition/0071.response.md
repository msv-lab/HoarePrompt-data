Postcondition: ***`i` is \(k + 2\), `m` is the same as before, `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\), `k` is at least 1, `j` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `remaining_potions` is \(\max(0, n - c[j])\), `time_with_both_spells` is either `remaining_potions * a[i]` if `d[j] <= remaining_manapoints` or unchanged, `min_time` is either the minimum value between the old `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells` if `d[j] <= remaining_manapoints` or unchanged.***
