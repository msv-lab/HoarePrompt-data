`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`. Here, `i` is `k + 2`, so `b[i]` is `b[k + 2]`. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and the value of `m` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is \(k + 2\); `m` is the same as before; `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\).

Output State: **`i` is \(k + 2\); `m` is the same as before; `remaining_manapoints` is \(s - b[k + 2]\).**
