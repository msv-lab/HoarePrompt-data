Postcondition: **`d[j]`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time` are relevant variables. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`. Otherwise, the innermost loop or if statement is broken out of.**
