Postcondition: ***`d[k]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, and `min_time` is an integer. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is set to `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `remaining_potions * a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, and `min_time` remain unchanged.***
