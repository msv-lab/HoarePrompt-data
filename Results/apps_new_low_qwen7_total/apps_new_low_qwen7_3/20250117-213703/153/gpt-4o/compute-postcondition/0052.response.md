The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case structure in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions.

Output State: **`d[j+1]` is an integer, `remaining_manapoints` is an integer, `remaining_potions` is a non-negative integer, `time_with_both_spells` is an integer, `min_time` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
