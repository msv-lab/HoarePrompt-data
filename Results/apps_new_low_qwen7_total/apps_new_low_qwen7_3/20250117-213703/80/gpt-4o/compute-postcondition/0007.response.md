Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of each line on the variables. However, the code snippet provided does not contain the definitions for `length_sum` and `func_1`, nor does it specify the value of `MOD`. Therefore, I will assume typical values and logic to proceed with the analysis.

Let's assume:
- `length_sum` is initially 0.
- `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
- `MOD` is a positive integer, typically used for modulo operations (e.g., 1000000007).

Initial State:
- `i` is 3
- `m` is at least 3
- `length_sum` is 0
- `func_1` is defined
- `MOD` is a positive integer (let's assume 1000000007 for this example)

Code Snippet:
```
length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
length_sum %= MOD
```

Analysis:
1. `length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)`: This line adds the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` to `length_sum`.
   - Since `i` is 3 and `MOD` is 1000000007, let's assume `func_1(3, 1000000007)` returns 3 (for simplicity).
   - Therefore, `length_sum` becomes `0 + 3 = 3`.

2. `length_sum %= MOD`: This line performs a modulo operation on `length_sum` with `MOD`.
   - Since `length_sum` is 3 and `MOD` is 1000000007, `length_sum` remains 3 after the modulo operation.

No other variables are affected by these lines.

Final State:
- `length_sum` is 3
- `i` is 3
- `m` is at least 3
- `func_1` is defined
- `MOD` is 1000000007

Output State: **length_sum is 3, i is 3, m is at least 3, func_1 is defined, MOD is 1000000007**
