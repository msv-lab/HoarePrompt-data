Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `length_sum` is calculated as `func_1(1, 1000000007) % 1000000007`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head involves the variables `i` and `m`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be increased to 3 for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the condition `i < m + 1` will hold true if `m` is at least 2.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` should be increased by 1, so it becomes 3.
   - `m` remains at least 1, but since `i` is now 3, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\), `length_sum` is func_1(1, 1000000007) % 1000000007**
