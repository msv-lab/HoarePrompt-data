Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, m + 1)`. This means the variables `i` and `m` are the ones that determine whether the loop can execute.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `length_sum` is 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `m` is at least 3
   - `func_1` is defined
   - `MOD` is 1000000007

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` is at least 3.
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented from 3, making it 4.
   - Therefore, `m` must still be at least 4 (since `i` starts from 1 and needs to be less than `m + 1`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `length_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to 4.
   - `m` must be at least 4.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`length_sum` is 3, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `func_1` is defined, `MOD` is 1000000007**
