Output State: **m is at least 1, i is 2, MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7, length_sum is func_1(1, 1000000007) % 1000000007**

Explanation:
- The first line `length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)` increments `length_sum` by the result of `func_1(i, MOD)`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\), the function `func_1(1, 1000000007)` is called and its result is added to `length_sum`.
- After this addition, `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it does not exceed the value of `MOD`.
- The second line `i = 2` updates the value of `i` to 2.
- Other variables like `m` and `MOD` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code block.
