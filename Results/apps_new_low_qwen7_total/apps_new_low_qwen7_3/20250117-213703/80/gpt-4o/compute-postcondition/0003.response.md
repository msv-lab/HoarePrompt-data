The code initializes `length_sum` to 0, which does not depend on the value of `m`. The value of `MOD` remains unchanged. The value of `m` also remains unchanged since no operations are performed on it.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and `MOD` is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7; `length_sum` is 0.**
