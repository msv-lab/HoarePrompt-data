Output State: **length_sum is 3, i is 4, m is at least 4, func_1 is defined, MOD is 1000000007**

Explanation:
1. The first line of code increments `length_sum` by the result of calling `func_1(i, MOD)`. Given the initial state where `length_sum` is 3, `i` is 4, and `MOD` is 1000000007, the new value of `length_sum` becomes `3 + func_1(4, 1000000007)`.
2. The second line ensures that `length_sum` is taken modulo `MOD`, so the new value of `length_sum` becomes `(3 + func_1(4, 1000000007)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `func_1(4, 1000000007)`. However, we know that `length_sum` is updated based on this value, and it is then reduced modulo `1000000007`.

No other variables (`i`, `m`, `func_1`, or `MOD`) are affected by these lines of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
