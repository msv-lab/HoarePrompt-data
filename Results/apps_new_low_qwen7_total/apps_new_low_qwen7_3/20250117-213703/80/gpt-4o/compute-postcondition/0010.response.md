To determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - `length_sum` is initialized to 0.
   - `MOD` is a constant integer representing \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `m`: This variable remains unchanged within the loop. It is the upper bound of the loop.
   - `i`: This variable starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m`.
   - `length_sum`: This variable is updated by adding the result of `func_1(i, MOD)` to it in each iteration and then taking modulo `MOD`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `m` times if `m > 0`. If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
   - In each iteration, `length_sum` is updated by adding `func_1(i, MOD)` and then taking modulo `MOD`. Therefore, after `m` iterations, `length_sum` will be the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for `i` from 1 to `m`, modulo `MOD`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The loop behavior and the provided output states are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

Given the above analysis, the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations will be:

- `m`: Remains the same as the initial value.
- `i`: The last value of `i` after the loop is `m + 1` (since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `m`).
- `MOD`: Remains constant at \(10^9 + 7\).
- `length_sum`: Is the sum of `func_1(i, MOD)` for `i` from 1 to `m`, modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is:

Output State: **m is the initial value, i is m + 1, MOD is 1000000007, length_sum is \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func}_1(i, 1000000007) \mod 1000000007\).**
