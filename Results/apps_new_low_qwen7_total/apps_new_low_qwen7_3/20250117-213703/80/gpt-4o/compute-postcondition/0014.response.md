Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. It returns either 1 or `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, where `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` modulo 1000000007 for `i` from 1 to `m`. If `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through integers from 1 to `m`, calling `func_1(i, 1000000007)` for each integer, accumulating their sum modulo 1000000007, and finally computes the result as `m * length_sum % 1000000007`.**

This summary covers all potential cases and includes the actual logic performed by the code, as per the provided annotated code and return postconditions.
