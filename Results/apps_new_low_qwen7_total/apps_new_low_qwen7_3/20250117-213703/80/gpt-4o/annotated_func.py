#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the modulo $10^9 + 7$, and p is a positive integer such that $a$ and $p$ are coprime and $p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$.
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a' modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`. Here, `a` is a positive integer, and `p` is a positive integer such that `a` and `p` are coprime and \( p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7} \). The function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and returns this value. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime and `p` is not zero modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior is undefined as per the given code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7. `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is the initial value, i is m + 1, MOD is 1000000007, length_sum is \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func}_1(i, 1000000007) \mod 1000000007\).
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns m * length_sum % 1000000007, where length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, 1000000007) mod 1000000007 for i from 1 to m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. It returns either 1 or `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, where `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` modulo 1000000007 for `i` from 1 to `m`. If `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through integers from 1 to `m`, calling `func_1(i, 1000000007)` for each integer, accumulating their sum modulo 1000000007, and finally computes the result as `m * length_sum % 1000000007`.
