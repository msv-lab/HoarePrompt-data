Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the described algorithm correctly. Specifically, the program calculates a sum involving modular inverses but does not simulate the process of generating the array \(a\) and checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) as described in the problem statement.

To elaborate, the program:
- Uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
- Computes a sum involving these modular inverses, which does not reflect the expected length calculation for the described algorithm.

However, the program does not simulate the random generation of elements in the array \(a\) and the condition-based termination of the loop. This means it does not correctly model the behavior of the algorithm as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
