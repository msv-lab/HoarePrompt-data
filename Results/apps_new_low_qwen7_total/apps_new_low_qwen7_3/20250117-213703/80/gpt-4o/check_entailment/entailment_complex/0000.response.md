Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - Given that `a` and `p` are coprime and \( p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7} \), the function should correctly compute the modular inverse.
   - The function meets the problem requirements by handling the calculation appropriately.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - For \( m = 1 \), the function correctly returns 1, which matches the problem statement.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the function iterates over all integers from 1 to \( m \), computing the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer with respect to \(10^9 + 7\) and summing these values.
   - This sum represents the expected length of the array \(a\) in terms of the given algorithm.
   - Finally, the function returns \( m \times \text{length\_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

By verifying the correctness of both functions:
- `func_1` correctly computes the modular multiplicative inverse.
- `func_2` correctly sums these inverses and applies the necessary modulus operations as required by the problem statement.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
