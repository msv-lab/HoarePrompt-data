Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that `func_2(m)` correctly computes the expected length of the array \(a\) as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Base Case**: When \(m = 1\), the output is 1, which matches the problem statement. If \(m = 1\), the array will always contain a single element 1, and the algorithm will terminate immediately.

2. **General Case**: For \(m > 1\), the program calculates the sum of the inverses of each possible GCD value (from 1 to \(m\)) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Specifically, it computes:
   \[
   \text{length\_sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func\_1}(i, 10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This sum represents the expected length of the array \(a\) when considering the contribution of each possible GCD value.

3. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: The function `func_1(a, p)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to weight the lengths according to the probability of the GCD being that value.

4. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the result is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{result} = m \times \text{length\_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the logic implemented in `func_2` aligns with the requirements. It correctly sums the contributions of each possible GCD value and applies the appropriate scaling factor \(m\).

Therefore, the implementation in `func_2` accurately computes the expected length of the array \(a\) as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
