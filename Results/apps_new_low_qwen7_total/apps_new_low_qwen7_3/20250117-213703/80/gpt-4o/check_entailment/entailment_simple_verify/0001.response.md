### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

#### Problem Description and Expected Behavior:
- Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer \( x \) (from 1 to \( m \)) to the array \( a \).
- He then computes the GCD of the array elements.
- If the GCD is 1, he stops.
- Otherwise, he continues appending.
- We need to find the expected length of the array \( a \).

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, p)`**:
   - Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of \( a \) modulo \( p \).
   - This is correctly implemented using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - If \( m == 1 \), it returns 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), it initializes `length_sum` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to \( m \) and for each integer \( i \), it adds \( i^{m-2} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) to `length_sum`.
   - Finally, it returns \( m \times \text{length\_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The core issue lies in the interpretation of the GCD condition.
- The program is incorrectly simulating the probability distribution of the GCD becoming 1.
- The logic in `func_2` does not accurately represent the expected length of the array based on the GCD condition.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly simulate the problem, we need to consider the following:
- The probability that the GCD remains non-1 decreases as more numbers are appended.
- The expected length can be derived from the probability that the GCD remains non-1 until the last element is appended.
- The provided solution attempts to calculate the modular inverses, which do not directly relate to the GCD probabilities.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not accurately simulate the expected length of the array based on the given algorithm. The logic in `func_2` does not reflect the correct probability calculations needed for the GCD to become 1.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
