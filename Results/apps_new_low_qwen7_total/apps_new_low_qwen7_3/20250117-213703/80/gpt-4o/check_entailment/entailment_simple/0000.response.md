### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves generating a sequence of numbers by repeatedly selecting a random integer between 1 and \( m \) until the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is 1.
   - The goal is to find the expected length of the sequence before it reaches GCD 1, expressed as \( P \cdot Q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \( m = 1 \), the expected length is 1 because the only possible value is 1, and the GCD condition is immediately satisfied.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the expected length is calculated using the properties of modular arithmetic and the concept of the modular multiplicative inverse.

3. **Analyze the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - This is done using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`, which is equivalent to finding \( a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - Handles the main computation.
     - If \( m = 1 \), it directly returns 1.
     - Otherwise, it iterates over all integers from 1 to \( m \), computes the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer, sums these inverses, and finally multiplies this sum by \( m \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem statement.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the computations stay within the required bounds.
   - The approach to calculate the expected length using the sum of modular inverses is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case \( m = 1 \) correctly by returning 1.
   - For other values of \( m \), the summation and final multiplication operations are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical flow and mathematical correctness of the code, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
