Reasoning:
The provided program seems to attempt to calculate the expected length of the array \(a\) using a different approach than the described algorithm. However, let's analyze the logic:

1. **func_1(a, p):** This function calculates \(a^{p-2} \mod p\), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\). This is used in calculating the modular inverse of numbers.

2. **func_2(m):** 
   - If \(m == 1\), it directly returns 1, which matches the base case.
   - For \(m > 1\), it iterates through all integers from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each integer \(i\), it adds \(i^{m-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) to `length_sum`.
   - Finally, it computes the result as \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given the problem statement and the expected output examples, the logic in `func_2` does not seem to align with the expected behavior. The expected length should be calculated based on the probability that the GCD of the array elements becomes 1, but the current implementation does not reflect this logic.

Upon closer inspection, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly simulate the probability of the GCD remaining non-1 until the final step where it becomes 1, thus making the output incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
