Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided code to determine if the logic in `func_2` aligns with the required behavior.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the expected length of the array \(a\) such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array elements is 1 when the process stops. The key insight here is to understand the probability that the GCD remains non-1 until the final step where it becomes 1.

### Code Analysis
1. **func_1(a, p):**
   - This function calculates \(a^{p-2} \mod p\), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\).
   
2. **func_2(m):**
   - If \(m == 1\), it directly returns 1, which is the base case.
   - For \(m > 1\), it iterates through all integers from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each integer \(i\), it calculates \(i^{m-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - It sums these values modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies the sum by \(m\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Analysis
The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically:
- The GCD calculation and stopping condition (when GCD becomes 1) are not properly handled.
- The use of modular inverses (\(i^{m-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)) does not directly relate to the expected length calculation.
- The sum of modular inverses does not represent the probability that the GCD remains non-1.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the probability that the GCD of the appended numbers remains non-1 until the last step. This involves understanding the probability that appending a new number keeps the GCD non-1, and how this probability changes as the array grows.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
