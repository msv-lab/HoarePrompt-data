You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. It returns either 1 or `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, where `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` modulo 1000000007 for `i` from 1 to `m`. If `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through integers from 1 to `m`, calling `func_1(i, 1000000007)` for each integer, accumulating their sum modulo 1000000007, and finally computes the result as `m * length_sum % 1000000007`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the described algorithm correctly. Specifically, the program calculates a sum involving modular inverses but does not simulate the process of generating the array \(a\) and checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) as described in the problem statement.

To elaborate, the program:
- Uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
- Computes a sum involving these modular inverses, which does not reflect the expected length calculation for the described algorithm.

However, the program does not simulate the random generation of elements in the array \(a\) and the condition-based termination of the loop. This means it does not correctly model the behavior of the algorithm as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
