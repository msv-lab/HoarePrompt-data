You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. It returns either 1 or `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, where `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` modulo 1000000007 for `i` from 1 to `m`. If `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through integers from 1 to `m`, calling `func_1(i, 1000000007)` for each integer, accumulating their sum modulo 1000000007, and finally computes the result as `m * length_sum % 1000000007`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program seems to attempt to calculate the expected length of the array \(a\) using a different approach than the described algorithm. However, let's analyze the logic:

1. **func_1(a, p):** This function calculates \(a^{p-2} \mod p\), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\) modulo \(p\). This is used in calculating the modular inverse of numbers.

2. **func_2(m):** 
   - If \(m == 1\), it directly returns 1, which matches the base case.
   - For \(m > 1\), it iterates through all integers from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each integer \(i\), it adds \(i^{m-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) to `length_sum`.
   - Finally, it computes the result as \(m \times \text{length\_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given the problem statement and the expected output examples, the logic in `func_2` does not seem to align with the expected behavior. The expected length should be calculated based on the probability that the GCD of the array elements becomes 1, but the current implementation does not reflect this logic.

Upon closer inspection, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly simulate the probability of the GCD remaining non-1 until the final step where it becomes 1, thus making the output incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program is not correct for the given problem.
