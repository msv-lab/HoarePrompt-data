### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic and behavior of the provided program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description:**
   - Vivek starts with an empty array \(a\) and an integer \(m\).
   - He repeatedly selects a random integer \(x\) from 1 to \(m\) and appends it to \(a\).
   - He then computes the GCD of the elements in \(a\).
   - If the GCD is 1, he stops; otherwise, he continues.
   - We need to find the expected length of \(a\).

2. **Program Logic:**
   - **Function `func_1(a, p)`**: Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `p` using \(a^{p-2} \mod p\).
   - **Function `func_2(m)`**:
     - If \(m == 1\), it returns 1.
     - For \(m > 1\), it iterates through all integers from 1 to \(m\), adding the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer to `length_sum`.
     - Finally, it computes the result as \(m \times \text{length_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Analysis of `func_2(m)`**:
   - The function does not correctly simulate the probability-based behavior described in the problem.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse of \(i\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is added to `length_sum` for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - The final result is computed as \(m \times \text{length_sum} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given the problem, we need to compute the expected length of the array based on the probability that the GCD remains non-1 until the last element is appended and the GCD becomes 1. However, the current logic in `func_2(m)` does not capture this probabilistic nature. Instead, it simply accumulates the inverses of the numbers from 1 to \(m\), which does not reflect the actual expected length calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the described algorithm. The logic in `func_2(m)` does not align with the intended behavior of the problem, as it does not account for the probabilistic nature of the GCD becoming 1. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
