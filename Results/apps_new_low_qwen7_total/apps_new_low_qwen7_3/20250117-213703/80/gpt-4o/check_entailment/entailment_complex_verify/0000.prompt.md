You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vivek initially has an empty array $a$ and some integer constant $m$.

He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $x$ uniformly in range from $1$ to $m$ and append it to the end of $a$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $a$.  In case it equals to $1$, break  Otherwise, return to step $1$. 

Find the expected length of $a$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers and $Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Print the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the expected length of the array $a$ written as $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
1

Input
2

Output
2

Input
4

Output
333333338



-----Note-----

In the first example, since Vivek can choose only integers from $1$ to $1$, he will have $a=[1]$ after the first append operation, and after that quit the algorithm. Hence the length of $a$ is always $1$, so its expected value is $1$ as well.

In the second example, Vivek each time will append either $1$ or $2$, so after finishing the algorithm he will end up having some number of $2$'s (possibly zero), and a single $1$ in the end. The expected length of the list is $1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{2^2} + 3\cdot \frac{1}{2^3} + \ldots = 2$.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    if m == 1:
        return 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        length_sum %= MOD
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
m = int(input().strip())
print(func_2(m))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the modulo $10^9 + 7$, and p is a positive integer such that $a$ and $p$ are coprime and $p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$.
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular multiplicative inverse of 'a' modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is calculated as \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`. Here, `a` is a positive integer, and `p` is a positive integer such that `a` and `p` are coprime and \( p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7} \). The function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and returns this value. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime and `p` is not zero modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior is undefined as per the given code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(m):
    if (m == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000, and MOD is a constant integer representing 10^9 + 7. `m` is not equal to 1
    length_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        length_sum += func_1(i, MOD)
        
        length_sum %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: m is the initial value, i is m + 1, MOD is 1000000007, length_sum is \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{func}_1(i, 1000000007) \mod 1000000007\).
    result = m * length_sum % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns m * length_sum % 1000000007, where length_sum is the sum of func_1(i, 1000000007) mod 1000000007 for i from 1 to m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. It returns either 1 or `m * length_sum % 1000000007`, where `length_sum` is the sum of `func_1(i, 1000000007)` modulo 1000000007 for `i` from 1 to `m`. If `m` is 1, the function directly returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through integers from 1 to `m`, calling `func_1(i, 1000000007)` for each integer, accumulating their sum modulo 1000000007, and finally computes the result as `m * length_sum % 1000000007`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the described algorithm correctly. Specifically, the program calculates a sum involving modular inverses but does not simulate the process of generating the array \(a\) and checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) as described in the problem statement.

To elaborate, the program:
- Uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
- Computes a sum involving these modular inverses, which does not reflect the expected length calculation for the described algorithm.

However, the program does not simulate the random generation of elements in the array \(a\) and the condition-based termination of the loop. This means it does not correctly model the behavior of the algorithm as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
