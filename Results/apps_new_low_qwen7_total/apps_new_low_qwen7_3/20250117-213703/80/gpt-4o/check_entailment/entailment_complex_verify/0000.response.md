### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the described algorithm correctly. Let's analyze why:

1. **Problem Description vs. Program Implementation:**
   - According to the problem description, Vivek repeatedly appends a random integer \( x \) (uniformly selected from \( 1 \) to \( m \)) to the array \( a \) until the GCD of all elements in \( a \) is 1. The goal is to find the expected length of \( a \).
   - The provided program, however, does not simulate this process. Instead, it computes a sum involving modular inverses, which is unrelated to the algorithm's behavior.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(a, p - 2, p)`.
   - While the modular inverse is mathematically useful, it is not relevant to simulating the described algorithm.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` attempts to compute a sum involving these modular inverses, which is incorrect because:
     - The sum does not reflect the probability of appending each element and the stopping condition (GCD equals 1).
     - The program does not generate random numbers and check the GCD as required by the problem.

4. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `length_sum` is computed as `func_1(i, MOD)` for \( i \) from 1 to \( m \), which is not related to the expected length of the array in the described algorithm.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the algorithm as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not simulate the random generation of elements and the condition-based termination of the algorithm as specified in the problem description.
