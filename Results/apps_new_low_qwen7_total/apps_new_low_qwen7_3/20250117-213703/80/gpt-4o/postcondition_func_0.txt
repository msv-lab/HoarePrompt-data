The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `p`. Here, `a` is a positive integer, and `p` is a positive integer such that `a` and `p` are coprime and \( p \neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7} \). The function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the formula \(a^{p-2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and returns this value. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime and `p` is not zero modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior is undefined as per the given code.
