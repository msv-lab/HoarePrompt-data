### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main issues with the provided program. Let's re-examine the program's behavior and the problem requirements more closely.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the coordinates of two trees from standard input.
2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the two given points are on the same vertical line (`x1 == x2`), it calculates the other two points correctly.
   - If the two given points are on the same horizontal line (`y1 == y2`), it calculates the other two points correctly.
3. **Output Determination**: The program ensures that the calculated coordinates are within the specified range (-1000 to 1000) before printing them. If the coordinates are out of range, it prints `-1`.

However, the program fails to handle the general case where the two given points are not aligned vertically or horizontally. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility of the points being diagonally positioned.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: Points on the Same Vertical Line**:
  - If `x1 == x2`, the other two points are calculated as `(x1 + |y1 - y2|, y1)` and `(x1 - |y1 - y2|, y1)`.
  - This handles the scenario where the given points are vertically aligned.

- **Case 2: Points on the Same Horizontal Line**:
  - If `y1 == y2`, the other two points are calculated as `(x1, y1 + |x1 - x2|)` and `(x1, y1 - |x1 - x2|)`.
  - This handles the scenario where the given points are horizontally aligned.

- **General Case: Points Diagonally Positioned**:
  - The program does not handle this case. For example, if the points are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, the program does not provide the correct coordinates for the other two points.
  - The correct coordinates would be `(1, 0)` and `(0, 1)` or `(1, 1)` and `(0, 0)` depending on the configuration.

- **Range Check**:
  - The program checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range of -1000 to 1000 and prints `-1` if they are not.

### Example Cases:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 0 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1 0 -1 0
   ```
   - Correctly handled.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0 1 0 -1
   ```
   - Correctly handled.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 2
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   -1
   ```
   - Correctly handled.

4. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0 1 1 0
   ```
   - Correctly handled.

5. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 0
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0 1 1 0
   ```
   - Correctly handled.

### Conclusion:

While the program correctly handles the cases where the points are vertically or horizontally aligned, it fails to handle the general case of non-aligned points. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of the square vertices, specifically when the given points are not aligned vertically or horizontally.
