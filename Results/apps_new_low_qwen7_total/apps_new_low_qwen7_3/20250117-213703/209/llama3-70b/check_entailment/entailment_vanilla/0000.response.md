### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers representing the coordinates of two vertices of a square.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if the two given points are on the same vertical or horizontal line. If they are, it calculates the coordinates of the other two vertices accordingly.
3. **Output Determination**: The program ensures that the calculated coordinates are within the specified range (-1000 to 1000) before printing them. If the coordinates are out of range, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: Points on the Same Vertical Line**:
  - If `x1 == x2`, then the other two points will be `(x1 + |y1 - y2|, y1)` and `(x1 - |y1 - y2|, y1)`.
  - Example: Given points `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`, the other two points should be `(1, 0)` and `(-1, 0)`.
  
- **Case 2: Points on the Same Horizontal Line**:
  - If `y1 == y2`, then the other two points will be `(x1, y1 + |x1 - x2|)` and `(x1, y1 - |x1 - x2|)`.
  - Example: Given points `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`, the other two points should be `(0, 1)` and `(0, -1)`.

- **General Case: Points Diagonally Positioned**:
  - The program does not handle the general case where the points are not aligned vertically or horizontally. For example, if the points are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, the program does not provide the correct coordinates for the other two points.

- **Range Check**:
  - The program checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range of -1000 to 1000 and prints `-1` if they are not.

### Example Cases:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 0 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1 0 -1 0
   ```

2. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0 1 0 -1
   ```

3. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 2
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   -1
   ```

Given these considerations, the provided program handles the specific cases correctly but does not handle the general case of non-aligned points. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of the square vertices, specifically when the given points are not aligned vertically or horizontally.
