Reasoning:
The annotated program has some logical flaws in how it determines and outputs the coordinates of the two remaining trees. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Coordinates**: 
   - If \(x1 == x2\), the current logic incorrectly sets \(x3\) and \(x4\) based on \(y1\) and \(y2\). This does not form a square but rather an invalid configuration.
   - Similarly, if \(x1 \neq x2\), the logic incorrectly sets \(y3\) and \(y4\) based on \(x1\) and \(x2\).

2. **Logic for Determining Remaining Trees**:
   - For the coordinates to form a square, the distance between \(x1, y1\) and \(x2, y2\) should be considered, and the remaining points should be found such that all distances between the points are equal and form a square.
   - If \(x1 == x2\), the trees must be vertically aligned, and the remaining trees should be horizontally aligned at the same y-coordinate.
   - If \(y1 == y2\), the trees must be horizontally aligned, and the remaining trees should be vertically aligned at the same x-coordinate.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the points do not form a valid square or when the points are collinear.

Given the above issues, the provided logic does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the remaining trees to form a square. Therefore, the program as annotated is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
