You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).


-----Examples-----
Input
0 0 0 1

Output
1 0 1 1

Input
0 0 1 1

Output
0 1 1 0

Input
0 0 1 2

Output
-1

- Program:
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x2:
        (x3, x4) = (x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2))
        (y3, y4) = (y1, y2)
    else:
        (y3, y4) = (y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2))
        (x3, x4) = (x1, x2)
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the coordinates of two trees from standard input, ensuring they are distinct and within the specified range (-100, 100). Based on whether the x-coordinates of the trees are equal, it calculates new coordinates (x3, x4, y3, y4) according to specific formulas. If the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two given points are adjacent (i.e., they share either an x-coordinate or a y-coordinate). In such cases, the calculated coordinates for the other two vertices would fall outside the specified range or would not form a valid square.

For example, consider the input:
```
0 0 1 0
```

The program will calculate the coordinates of the other two vertices as (1, 0) and (0, -1), which falls outside the range (-1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and (-1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000). Therefore, the program should print `-1` in this case, but it does not. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is `False`.
