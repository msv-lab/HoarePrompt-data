You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Pashmak has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...

Today, Pashmak set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Pashmak has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly one tree on each vertex of the square. Now, Pashmak knows the position of only two of the trees. Help him to find the position of two remaining ones.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct.


-----Output-----

If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. 

Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000).


-----Examples-----
Input
0 0 0 1

Output
1 0 1 1

Input
0 0 1 1

Output
0 1 1 0

Input
0 0 1 2

Output
-1

- Program:
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x2:
        (x3, x4) = (x1 + abs(y1 - y2), x1 - abs(y1 - y2))
        (y3, y4) = (y1, y2)
    else:
        (y3, y4) = (y1 + abs(x1 - x2), y1 - abs(x1 - x2))
        (x3, x4) = (x1, x2)
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and (-1000 <= y3 <= 1000) and (-1000 <= y4 <= 1000):
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the coordinates of two trees from standard input, ensuring they are distinct and within the specified range (-100, 100). Based on whether the x-coordinates of the trees are equal, it calculates new coordinates (x3, x4, y3, y4) according to specific formulas. If the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads four integers representing the coordinates of two vertices of a square.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if the two given points are on the same vertical or horizontal line. If they are, it calculates the coordinates of the other two vertices accordingly.
3. **Output Determination**: The program ensures that the calculated coordinates are within the specified range (-1000 to 1000) before printing them. If the coordinates are out of range, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: Points on the Same Vertical Line**:
  - If `x1 == x2`, then the other two points will be `(x1 + |y1 - y2|, y1)` and `(x1 - |y1 - y2|, y1)`.
  - Example: Given points `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`, the other two points should be `(1, 0)` and `(-1, 0)`.
  
- **Case 2: Points on the Same Horizontal Line**:
  - If `y1 == y2`, then the other two points will be `(x1, y1 + |x1 - x2|)` and `(x1, y1 - |x1 - x2|)`.
  - Example: Given points `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`, the other two points should be `(0, 1)` and `(0, -1)`.

- **General Case: Points Diagonally Positioned**:
  - The program does not handle the general case where the points are not aligned vertically or horizontally. For example, if the points are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`, the program does not provide the correct coordinates for the other two points.

- **Range Check**:
  - The program checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range of -1000 to 1000 and prints `-1` if they are not.

### Example Cases:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 0 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1 0 -1 0
   ```

2. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0 1 0 -1
   ```

3. **Input:**
   ```
   0 0 1 2
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   -1
   ```

Given these considerations, the provided program handles the specific cases correctly but does not handle the general case of non-aligned points. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of the square vertices, specifically when the given points are not aligned vertically or horizontally.
