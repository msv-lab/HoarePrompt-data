### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis
- We need to determine the coordinates of the other two vertices of a square given the coordinates of two vertices.
- The two given points must be distinct and lie on the perimeter of the square, meaning they share either an x-coordinate or a y-coordinate.

#### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the coordinates of the two trees from standard input.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code checks if the x-coordinates of the two points are equal. If they are, it calculates the y-coordinates of the other two vertices by adding and subtracting the absolute difference in y-coordinates. Similarly, if the y-coordinates are equal, it calculates the x-coordinates by adding and subtracting the absolute difference in x-coordinates.
3. **Range Check**: The code checks if the calculated coordinates are within the specified range (-1000 to 1000). If they are, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints -1.

#### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Case 1: Points Share an X-coordinate**
   - Given points: \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) where \( x_1 = x_2 \).
   - Calculated points: \( (x_3, y_3) = (x_1 + |y_1 - y_2|, y_1) \) and \( (x_4, y_4) = (x_1 - |y_1 - y_2|, y_2) \).

2. **Case 2: Points Share a Y-coordinate**
   - Given points: \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) where \( y_1 = y_2 \).
   - Calculated points: \( (x_3, y_3) = (x_1 + |x_1 - x_2|, y_1) \) and \( (x_4, y_4) = (x_2 - |x_1 - x_2|, y_1) \).

3. **Handling the Range**
   - The code checks if the calculated coordinates are within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). If they are, it prints the coordinates; otherwise, it prints -1.

#### Specific Test Case Analysis
- Consider the input: \( (0, 0) \) and \( (1, 0) \).
  - Since the x-coordinates are equal, the calculated points are:
    - \( (x_3, y_3) = (0 + |0 - 0|, 0) = (0, 0) \)
    - \( (x_4, y_4) = (0 - |0 - 0|, 0) = (0, 0) \)
  - These points are the same as the given points, which means the code will correctly handle this case and print -1.

- Consider the input: \( (0, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \).
  - Since the y-coordinates are equal, the calculated points are:
    - \( (x_3, y_3) = (0 + |0 - 0|, 0) = (0, 0) \)
    - \( (x_4, y_4) = (0 - |0 - 0|, 1) = (0, 1) \)
  - These points are the same as the given points, which means the code will correctly handle this case and print -1.

- Consider the input: \( (0, 0) \) and \( (1, 1) \).
  - The calculated points are:
    - \( (x_3, y_3) = (0 + |0 - 1|, 0) = (1, 0) \)
    - \( (x_4, y_4) = (1 - |0 - 1|, 1) = (0, 1) \)
  - These points are valid and within the range, so the code will print these coordinates.

#### Conclusion
The code correctly handles all edge cases where the given points are adjacent and ensures the calculated points are within the specified range. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
