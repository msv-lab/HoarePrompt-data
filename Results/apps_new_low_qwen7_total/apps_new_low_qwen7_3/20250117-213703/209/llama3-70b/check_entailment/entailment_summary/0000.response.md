Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and ensures the coordinates are distinct.
2. The logic for determining the positions of the other two trees based on the given conditions is mostly correct but needs some adjustments for all possible orientations of the square.
3. The current implementation only considers the cases where one side of the square is vertical or horizontal. It fails to handle the diagonal cases properly.
4. For example, if the input is `0 0 1 1`, the program correctly identifies that the other two points could be `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`. However, for inputs like `0 0 1 2`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` because it doesn't handle the diagonal orientation properly.

To fix this, we need to consider all possible orientations of the square. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the differences
    dx = abs(x1 - x2)
    dy = abs(y1 - y2)
    
    # Check if the points form a vertical or horizontal line
    if x1 == x2:
        x3, x4 = x1, x1
        y3, y4 = y1 + dy, y1 - dy
    elif y1 == y2:
        y3, y4 = y1, y1
        x3, x4 = x1 + dx, x1 - dx
    else:
        # Calculate the other two points considering the diagonal
        x3, y3 = x1 + dy, y1 + dx
        x4, y4 = x2 + dy, y2 + dx
    
    # Ensure the coordinates are within the specified range
    if -1000 <= x3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= x4 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y3 <= 1000 and -1000 <= y4 <= 1000:
        print(x3, y3, x4, y4)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

With this correction, the program should work for all possible orientations of the square.

Correctness: **False**
