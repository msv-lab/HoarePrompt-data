Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two given points are adjacent (i.e., they share either an x-coordinate or a y-coordinate). In such cases, the calculated coordinates for the other two vertices would fall outside the specified range or would not form a valid square.

For example, consider the input:
```
0 0 1 0
```

The program will calculate the coordinates of the other two vertices as (1, 0) and (0, -1), which falls outside the range (-1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and (-1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000). Therefore, the program should print `-1` in this case, but it does not. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is `False`.
