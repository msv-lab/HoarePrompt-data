The function reads the coordinates of two trees from standard input, ensuring they are distinct and within the specified range (-100, 100). Based on whether the x-coordinates of the trees are equal, it calculates new coordinates (x3, x4, y3, y4) according to specific formulas. If the calculated coordinates are within the range [-1000, 1000], it prints these coordinates; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
