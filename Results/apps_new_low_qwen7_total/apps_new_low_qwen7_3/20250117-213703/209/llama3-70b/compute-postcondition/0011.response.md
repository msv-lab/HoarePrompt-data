The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The input data is expected to be read from standard input in the specified format, and the output should be written to standard output in the specified format. The coordinates of the two known trees are distinct and lie within the range (-100, 100) for both x and y coordinates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read coordinates of two trees from standard input, ensure they are distinct and within the specified range, and then perform some operation or calculation based on these coordinates, writing the result to standard output.

Functionality: **The function reads coordinates of two trees from standard input, ensures they are distinct and within the specified range, and writes the result to standard output.**
