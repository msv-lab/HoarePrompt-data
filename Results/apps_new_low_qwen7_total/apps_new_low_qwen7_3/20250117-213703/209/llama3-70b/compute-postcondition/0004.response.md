The initial state is given as follows:
- `x1` is an input integer
- `y1` is an input integer
- `x2` is an input integer
- `y2` is an input integer
- `x1` is not equal to `x2`

The code block performs the following operations:
1. Assigns `y3` the value of `y1 + abs(x1 - x2)`
2. Assigns `y4` the value of `y1 - abs(x1 - x2)`
3. Assigns `x3` the value of `x1`
4. Assigns `x4` the value of `x2`

Since `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `abs(x1 - x2)` will be a non-zero positive integer. Let's denote this absolute difference as `diff`. Then:
- `y3` will be `y1 + diff`
- `y4` will be `y1 - diff`
- `x3` will be `x1`
- `x4` will be `x2`

No other variables are affected. Therefore, the final state after running the code block is:
Output State: **x1 is an input integer, y1 is an input integer, x2 is an input integer, y2 is an input integer, x3 is an input integer equal to x1, x4 is an input integer equal to x2, y3 is y1 plus the absolute difference between x1 and x2, y4 is y1 minus the absolute difference between x1 and x2**
