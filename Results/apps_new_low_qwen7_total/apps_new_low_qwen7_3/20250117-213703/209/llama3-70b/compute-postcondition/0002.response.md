Output State: **x1 is an input integer, x2 is an input integer (with x1 equal to x2), x3 is 2 * x1 - abs(y1 - y2), x4 is -abs(y1 - y2), y3 is an input integer, y4 is an input integer**
Explanation:
- The first line creates two new variables `x3` and `x4` and assigns them the values `x1 + abs(y1 - y2)` and `x1 - abs(y1 - y2)` respectively. Given that `x1` is equal to `x2`, `x3` becomes `2 * x1 - abs(y1 - y2)` and `x4` becomes `-abs(y1 - y2)`.
- The second and third lines create two new variables `y3` and `y4` and assign them the values `y1` and `y2` respectively. These assignments do not change the initial states of `y1` and `y2`, so `y3` is an input integer and `y4` is an input integer.
- The initial values of `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged, but now they also represent the same value due to the assignment operations.
- The values of `y1` and `y2` remain unchanged, but they are reassigned to `y3` and `y4` respectively.
