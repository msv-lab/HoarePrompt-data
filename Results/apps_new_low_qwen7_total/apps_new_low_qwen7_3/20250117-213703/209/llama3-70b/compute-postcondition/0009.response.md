The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers; `x3` remains equal to `x1`, and `x4` remains equal to `x2`; `y3` is `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, and `y4` is `y1 - |x1 - x2|`; the console prints `-1`.**
