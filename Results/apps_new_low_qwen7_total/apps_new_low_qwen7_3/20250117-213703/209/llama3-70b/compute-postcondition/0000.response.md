The code reads four integers from standard input, which represent the coordinates of two trees, and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Since the input values are read during the execution of this line, these variables will now hold the input values. The previous state of the variables is not relevant because they are being assigned new values. The output state will reflect the assignment of these input values to the respective variables.

Output State: **`x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer**
