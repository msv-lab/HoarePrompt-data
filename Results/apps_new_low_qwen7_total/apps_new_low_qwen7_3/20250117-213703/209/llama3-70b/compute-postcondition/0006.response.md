Postcondition: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers. If `x1` equals `x2`, then `x3` is `2 * x1 - |y1 - y2|`, and `x4` is `-|y1 - y2|`. Otherwise, `x3` remains equal to `x1`, and `x4` remains equal to `x2`. `y3` is `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, and `y4` is `y1 - |x1 - x2|`. Additionally, the following conditions hold: `-1000 <= x3 <= 1000`, `-1000 <= x4 <= 1000`, `-1000 <= y3 <= 1000`, and `-1000 <= y4 <= 1000`.**
