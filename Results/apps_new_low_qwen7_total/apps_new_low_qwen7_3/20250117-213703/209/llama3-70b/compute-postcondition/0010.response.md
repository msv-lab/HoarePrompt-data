Postcondition: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers. If `x1` equals `x2`, then `x3` is `2 * x1 - |y1 - y2|`, `x4` is `-|y1 - y2|`, `y3` is `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, and `y4` is `y1 - |x1 - x2|`, and the console prints `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`. Otherwise, `x3` remains equal to `x1`, `x4` remains equal to `x2`, `y3` is `y1 + |x1 - x2|`, and `y4` is `y1 - |x1 - x2|`, and the console prints `-1`.**
