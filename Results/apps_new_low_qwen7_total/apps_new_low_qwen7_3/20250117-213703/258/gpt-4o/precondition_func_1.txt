N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100.
