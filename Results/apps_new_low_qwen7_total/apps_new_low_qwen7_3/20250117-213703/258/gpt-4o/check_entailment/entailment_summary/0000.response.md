Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for determining if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready. It iterates through all pairs of meats, rearranges them if necessary, and calculates a new position `(mx, my)` where the heat source could be placed. It then checks if at least `K` pieces of meat are within a certain distance from this position. The function correctly identifies configurations that allow at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready but lacks handling for edge cases like an empty list of meats or `K` being out of bounds.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready. It correctly narrows down the search range until it finds the appropriate `T` value. However, it assumes that `func_1` is correctly implemented and provides accurate results, which is the case here.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, parses the necessary data, and calls `func_2` with the appropriate arguments. It correctly handles the input format and ensures that the results are printed with the specified precision. The function does not handle potential edge cases related to input validation, but these are typically part of the overall program's robustness rather than correctness.

Given that:
- `func_1` correctly checks if a given time allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.
- `func_2` correctly uses binary search to find the minimum time.
- `func_3` correctly processes the input and calls the other functions.

All the functions together meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
