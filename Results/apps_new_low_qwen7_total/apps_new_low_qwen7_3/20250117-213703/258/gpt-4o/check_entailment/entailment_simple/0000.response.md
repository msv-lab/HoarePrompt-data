### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks all pairs of meats to see if there's a better position for the heat source that would allow at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready by a certain time `T`.
   - It uses a mathematical approach to find possible positions (`mx`, `my`) for the heat source based on the distance and hardness of the meats.
   - The function iterates through all pairs of meats, calculates the necessary conditions, and checks if the given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.
   - If it finds such a position, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` with increasing precision until the difference between `high` and `low` is within `1e-07`.
   - Once the correct `T` is found, it returns `high`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, parses the data, and initializes the list of meats.
   - It then calls `func_2` to compute the minimum time required to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready.
   - Finally, it prints the result formatted to six decimal places.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Individual Functions**:
  - `func_1` correctly identifies if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.
  - `func_2` correctly performs a binary search to find the minimum `T` using `func_1`.
  - `func_3` correctly reads input, processes it, and computes the desired result.

- **Overall Correctness**:
  - The program structure is sound and follows the problem constraints.
  - The logic for finding the optimal time `T` is implemented correctly using binary search and checking pairs of meats.
  - The output formatting meets the requirement of being accurate to six decimal places.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided annotated program and the described functions, the overall implementation is correct and should produce the expected results.

**Correctness: **True**
