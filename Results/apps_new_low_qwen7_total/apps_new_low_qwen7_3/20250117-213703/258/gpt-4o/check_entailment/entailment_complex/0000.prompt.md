Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: x_i, y_i, and c_i (coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat), K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a non-negative floating-point number representing a potential time value.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
            x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
            if c1 * T < c2 * T:
                x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1

            cx = (x1 + x2) / 2

            dx = (x1 - x2) / 2
            dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
            d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
            if d * d2 > d2:
                continue
            mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)
            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All variables `x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, d, cx, cy, dx, dy, d2, mx, my` are updated to their final values after the last iteration of the loop. `count` is the final value of the sum of `c` values where the condition \( c \times \sqrt{(cx - x) ^ 2 + (cy - y) ^ 2} \leq T \) holds true for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`. If `count >= K`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` and hardness `c_i` of a piece of meat, an integer `K` such that `1 <= K <= len(meats)`, and a non-negative floating-point number `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meats, comparing their hardness adjusted by `T`. For each pair, it calculates a new position `(mx, my)` and checks if there are at least `K` pieces of meat within a certain distance from this position, defined by the adjusted hardness and `T`. If such a configuration is found, the function returns `True`. If no such configuration is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`.

The function does not handle edge cases where `meats` is an empty list or `K` is out of bounds (i.e., `K < 1` or `K > len(meats)`). If `meats` is an empty list, the function should ideally return `False`. Additionally, while the code checks if `count >= K`, it does not explicitly handle the case where `count == K - 1` or when no pairs satisfy the condition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100; `low` is approximately 500000000.0, `high` is approximately 1000000000.0, `mid` is approximately 500000000.0. `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True, and `high - low <= 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high which is approximately 1000000000.0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N.
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100.

The function uses a binary search approach to find a value `high` within a range [0, 1000000000.0] that satisfies a certain condition determined by the function `func_1`. Specifically, it repeatedly narrows down the range by adjusting `low` and `high` until the difference between them is less than 1e-07. During each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and checks if `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True. If it does, `high` is set to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

After the loop, the function returns the value of `high`, which is approximately 1000000000.0.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `N` is 1, the function still proceeds as normal since the condition 1 <= K <= N is satisfied.
- If `K` is 1, the function will still execute correctly, though the specific behavior might depend on the values in `meats`.

There is no missing functionality in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the operations performed by the code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: data is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N. Each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c), where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100, and no two pieces of meat have the same coordinates.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])

K = int(data[1])

meats = []

index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer, K is an integer, meats is a list of tuples containing up to N elements (each element is a tuple of the form (x, y, c)), index is 3 + 3 * N.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)

print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a single input string `data`, which contains space-separated integers and coordinates of meat pieces. It processes this input to extract the number of pieces of meat `N`, the integer `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. After extracting this information, it calls another function `func_2` with the extracted values. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or incorrect spacing, which would cause the function to fail when attempting to split or convert the input string. Additionally, if `N` exceeds the allowed limit of 60 or `K` is greater than `N`, these conditions are not explicitly handled within the provided code.
