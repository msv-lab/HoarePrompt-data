Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function iterates over all pairs of meats to find a potential optimal position for the heat source.
   - It correctly calculates distances and checks if a certain number of pieces of meat (at least `K`) can be grilled within a certain time `T`.
   - However, it does not handle some edge cases, such as when `meats` is an empty list or when `K` is out of bounds (i.e., `K < 1` or `K > len(meats)`).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled.
   - It calls `func_1` with progressively narrower ranges to find the optimal `T`.
   - The binary search logic is correct and handles the problem constraints well.

3. **Function `func_3` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and processes it to prepare the necessary data structures.
   - It correctly splits the input string and converts the relevant parts into integers.
   - It then passes the processed data to `func_2` and prints the result formatted to six decimal places.

### Overall Analysis:
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - The code does not handle the case where `meats` is an empty list or when `K` is out of bounds (`K < 1` or `K > len(meats)`). However, the constraints specify that `1 <= N <= 60` and `1 <= K <= N`, so these cases are unlikely to occur under the given constraints.
  - The code does not explicitly handle invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or incorrect spacing, but this is generally outside the scope of the correctness of the algorithm itself.

- **Algorithm Validity**:
  - The binary search in `func_2` is designed to find the minimum `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat can be grilled, and it correctly uses `func_1` to validate the conditions.
  - The logic in `func_1` for finding the optimal position for the heat source is also correct.

Given the above analysis, the provided code meets the problem requirements and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
