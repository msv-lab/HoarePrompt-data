You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a single input string `data`, which contains space-separated integers and coordinates of meat pieces. It processes this input to extract the number of pieces of meat `N`, the integer `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. After extracting this information, it calls another function `func_2` with the extracted values. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or incorrect spacing, which would cause the function to fail when attempting to split or convert the input string. Additionally, if `N` exceeds the allowed limit of 60 or `K` is greater than `N`, these conditions are not explicitly handled within the provided code.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the minimum time required to have \(K\) or more pieces of meat ready. However, there are issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready by comparing pairs of meats. It iterates through all pairs, but the logic for determining if a pair of meats can be ready within time `T` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `mx` and `my` (the coordinates of the heat source) does not correctly account for the distances and the given time `T`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, the use of `func_1` inside this function is not appropriate because `func_1` is not correctly determining whether a given time `T` is sufficient for at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to compute the result. The input reading part seems to be correct, but the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed.

A specific case where the program fails can be constructed. Consider the following input:
```
4 3
0 0 3
1 0 3
2 0 3
3 0 3
```
The optimal solution would place the heat source at \( (1.5, 0) \) with a time of 3 seconds, allowing all three pieces of meat to be ready. However, the current implementation might fail to find this optimal solution due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case and thus returns **False**.
