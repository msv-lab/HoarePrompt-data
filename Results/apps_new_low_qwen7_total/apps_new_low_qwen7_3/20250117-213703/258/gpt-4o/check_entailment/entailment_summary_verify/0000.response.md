### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-evaluate the functions and the overall logic to confirm that the program indeed has issues and is not correct for every potential case.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The purpose of `func_1` is to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   - The function compares pairs of meats and calculates a hypothetical heat source position `(mx, my)` based on the distance and hardness. This calculation does not accurately reflect the time `T` needed to grill the meats.
   - The logic for determining if a pair of meats can be ready within time `T` is incorrect. Specifically, the calculation of `mx` and `my` is based on an incorrect assumption about the optimal placement of the heat source.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
   - The function `func_1` is called within `func_2` to determine if a given `T` is sufficient. Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` cannot accurately determine the minimum time `T`.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to compute the result.
   - The input reading part seems correct, but the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
4 3
0 0 3
1 0 3
2 0 3
3 0 3
```
The optimal solution would place the heat source at \( (1.5, 0) \) with a time of 3 seconds, allowing all three pieces of meat to be ready. However, the current implementation might fail to find this optimal solution due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case and thus returns **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
