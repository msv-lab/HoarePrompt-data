You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and approach taken in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready by placing the heat source optimally between pairs of meats.
- It iterates over all pairs of meats and checks if they can be placed such that the time `T` is sufficient for all pieces to be ready.
- If a pair can satisfy the condition, it calculates the optimal position of the heat source and counts how many pieces would be ready at time `T`.
- However, the function does not correctly handle the case where multiple pairs could be used simultaneously. It only checks pairs and not a combination of multiple pairs to achieve the optimal time for `K` pieces.

### Function `func_2`
- The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
- It calls `func_1` with different times `T` to check if `K` pieces can be ready by that time.
- The binary search works correctly in terms of narrowing down the time interval until the precision requirement (`10^{-7}`) is met.
- However, since `func_1` only checks pairs and not combinations, the result may not be the true optimal time.

### Function `func_3`
- The function `func_3` reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to compute the result.
- It prints the result with the required precision.

### Overall Analysis
- The main issue lies in `func_1`. While it correctly checks pairs of meats, it does not consider the optimal placement of the heat source for more than two pieces of meat simultaneously.
- The binary search in `func_2` might converge to an incorrect solution due to the flawed `func_1`.

Given these observations, the overall program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal placement of the heat source considering all possible configurations of the meats.
