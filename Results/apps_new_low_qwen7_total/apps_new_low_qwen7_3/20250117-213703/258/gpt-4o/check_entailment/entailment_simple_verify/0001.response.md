### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Determine if at least `K` pieces of meat can be ready by time `T` by checking pairs of meats.
- **Logic**: 
  - The function iterates over all pairs of meats and checks if placing the heat source optimally between them can make the necessary pieces ready.
  - It calculates the optimal position of the heat source using geometric formulas and checks if the condition \(c \times \sqrt{(mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2} \leq T\) holds for each piece of meat.
  - However, as noted in the original assessment, `func_1` only considers pairs of meats and does not consider the optimal placement for more than two pieces simultaneously.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Use binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
- **Logic**: 
  - The function uses a binary search approach to narrow down the time interval.
  - It repeatedly calls `func_1` with different times `T` to check if `K` pieces can be ready by that time.
  - The binary search works correctly in terms of narrowing down the time interval until the precision requirement (`10^{-7}`) is met.
- **Issue**: As mentioned, since `func_1` only checks pairs and not combinations, the result may not be the true optimal time.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: Read input, process it into the format needed by the other functions, and then call `func_2` to compute the result.
- **Logic**: 
  - It reads the input, processes it into the required format, and then calls `func_2` to get the result.
  - Finally, it prints the result with the required precision.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Pairwise Consideration**:
   - `func_1` only considers pairs of meats, which means it might miss the optimal configuration when more than two pieces need to be considered simultaneously.
   - For example, if there are three pieces of meat that are close to each other, the optimal heat source might be somewhere in between all three, but `func_1` only considers pairs.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces are ready.
   - Since `func_1` only considers pairs, the binary search might converge to a suboptimal solution.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The problem requires finding the optimal heat source position for all pieces of meat, not just pairs.
   - A more sophisticated approach might involve considering the convex hull of the meat positions or using a more advanced optimization technique.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the optimal placement of the heat source for more than two pieces of meat simultaneously, leading to potentially suboptimal solutions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
