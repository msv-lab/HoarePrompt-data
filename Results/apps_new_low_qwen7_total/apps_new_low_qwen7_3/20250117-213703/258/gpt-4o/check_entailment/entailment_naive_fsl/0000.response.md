Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the minimum time required to have \(K\) or more pieces of meat ready. However, there are issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready by comparing pairs of meats. It iterates through all pairs, but the logic for determining if a pair of meats can be ready within time `T` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `mx` and `my` (the coordinates of the heat source) does not correctly account for the distances and the given time `T`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, the use of `func_1` inside this function is not appropriate because `func_1` is not correctly determining whether a given time `T` is sufficient for at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to compute the result. The input reading part seems to be correct, but the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is flawed.

A specific case where the program fails can be constructed. Consider the following input:
```
4 3
0 0 3
1 0 3
2 0 3
3 0 3
```
The optimal solution would place the heat source at \( (1.5, 0) \) with a time of 3 seconds, allowing all three pieces of meat to be ready. However, the current implementation might fail to find this optimal solution due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case and thus returns **False**.
