### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and approach taken in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` aims to check if there exists a configuration of the heat source such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready within time `T`.
- It iterates over all pairs of meats and checks if they can be used to minimize the time required for `K` pieces to be ready.
- If a pair can satisfy the condition, it calculates a new position `(mx, my)` and counts how many pieces would be ready at time `T`.
- However, as noted in the original assessment, the function does not handle the case where multiple pairs could be used simultaneously. It only checks pairs and not a combination of multiple pairs to achieve the optimal time for `K` pieces.

#### Function `func_2`
- The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
- It calls `func_1` with different times `T` to check if `K` pieces can be ready by that time.
- The binary search works correctly in terms of narrowing down the time interval until the precision requirement (`10^{-7}`) is met.
- However, since `func_1` only checks pairs and not combinations, the result may not be the true optimal time.

#### Function `func_3`
- The function `func_3` reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to compute the result.
- It prints the result with the required precision.

### Overall Analysis
- The main issue lies in `func_1`. While it correctly checks pairs of meats, it does not consider the optimal placement of the heat source for more than two pieces of meat simultaneously.
- The binary search in `func_2` might converge to an incorrect solution due to the flawed `func_1`.

### Correctness Check Using Annotations

Let's validate or challenge the original assessment using the annotated version:

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - The function iterates over all pairs of meats and checks if a pair can satisfy the condition.
   - If a pair can satisfy the condition, it calculates a new position `(mx, my)` and counts how many pieces would be ready at time `T`.
   - However, it does not consider multiple pairs simultaneously, which means it may miss the optimal solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - The function uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
   - It calls `func_1` with different times `T` to check if `K` pieces can be ready by that time.
   - The binary search works correctly in terms of narrowing down the time interval until the precision requirement (`10^{-7}`) is met.
   - Since `func_1` only checks pairs and not combinations, the result may not be the true optimal time.

3. **Function `func_3`**
   - The function reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to compute the result.
   - It prints the result with the required precision.

### Conclusion
- The main issue remains with `func_1`, which does not consider multiple pairs simultaneously to find the optimal placement of the heat source.
- The binary search in `func_2` relies on the results from `func_1`, which may not always provide the correct optimal time.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly account for the optimal placement of the heat source considering all possible configurations of the meats.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal placement of the heat source considering all possible configurations of the meats.
