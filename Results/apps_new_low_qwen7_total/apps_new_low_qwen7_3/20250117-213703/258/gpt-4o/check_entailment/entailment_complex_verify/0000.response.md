Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: Determine if there exists a point \((X, Y)\) such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready in time `T`.
2. **Flaws**:
   - The function compares pairs of meats to find a possible optimal point \((mx, my)\).
   - The logic for calculating `mx` and `my` is based on the assumption that the optimal point lies on the line segment connecting the two compared meats, which is not necessarily true.
   - The function does not consider the actual distance from the calculated point \((mx, my)\) to other meats, only the distance from the original points.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: Use binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
2. **Flaws**:
   - The function relies on `func_1` to determine if a given `T` is sufficient. As explained above, `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly calculate the necessary conditions.
   - The binary search range `[0, 1000000000.0]` is unnecessarily large and could be optimized.

### Function `func_3` Analysis:
1. **Purpose**: Read the input and call `func_2` to compute the result.
2. **Flaws**:
   - The input reading part seems to be correct.
   - However, as mentioned, the core functions `func_1` and `func_2` are flawed.

### Detailed Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Optimal Point**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the optimal point lies on the line segment between two pairs of meats, which is not generally true.
   - The calculations of `mx` and `my` do not correctly reflect the required distances and times.

2. **Binary Search Range**:
   - The binary search range `[0, 1000000000.0]` is too large and might lead to incorrect results due to precision issues.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `N` is 1 or `K` is 1 properly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The core functions `func_1` and `func_2` contain significant logical errors that prevent the program from correctly solving the problem for all cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Final: **False**
