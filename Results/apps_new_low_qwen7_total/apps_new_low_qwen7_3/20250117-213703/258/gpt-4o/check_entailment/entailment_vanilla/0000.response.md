Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and approach taken in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if a given time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready by placing the heat source optimally between pairs of meats.
- It iterates over all pairs of meats and checks if they can be placed such that the time `T` is sufficient for all pieces to be ready.
- If a pair can satisfy the condition, it calculates the optimal position of the heat source and counts how many pieces would be ready at time `T`.
- However, the function does not correctly handle the case where multiple pairs could be used simultaneously. It only checks pairs and not a combination of multiple pairs to achieve the optimal time for `K` pieces.

### Function `func_2`
- The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
- It calls `func_1` with different times `T` to check if `K` pieces can be ready by that time.
- The binary search works correctly in terms of narrowing down the time interval until the precision requirement (`10^{-7}`) is met.
- However, since `func_1` only checks pairs and not combinations, the result may not be the true optimal time.

### Function `func_3`
- The function `func_3` reads the input, processes it into the format needed by the other functions, and then calls `func_2` to compute the result.
- It prints the result with the required precision.

### Overall Analysis
- The main issue lies in `func_1`. While it correctly checks pairs of meats, it does not consider the optimal placement of the heat source for more than two pieces of meat simultaneously.
- The binary search in `func_2` might converge to an incorrect solution due to the flawed `func_1`.

Given these observations, the overall program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal placement of the heat source considering all possible configurations of the meats.

Correctness: **False**
