Precondition: **data is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N. Each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c), where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100, and no two pieces of meat have the same coordinates.**
