The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. In this context, the variables `count`, `j`, `d`, and `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` do not change their values as a result of the `continue` statement. The states of the other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`count` is `C + 1`, `j` is `i + C + 2`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain unchanged unless `c1 * T < c2 * T`, in which case `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, and `c1` is the original value of `c2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
