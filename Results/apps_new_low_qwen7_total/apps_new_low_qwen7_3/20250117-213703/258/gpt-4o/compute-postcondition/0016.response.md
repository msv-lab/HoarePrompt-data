`low` is updated to the value of `mid`. The function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True, `high - low > 1e-07` remains true, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `high - low > 1e-07`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`; `low` is now equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `high - low > 1e-07`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`; `low` is now equal to `mid`**
