Postcondition: ***`count` is updated based on the new conditions, `j` is `(i + C + 2)`, `d` is `((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2))`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Since the if condition is always true (`count >= K`), the function executes the if part and updates the variables as specified in the if part. There is no else part in the code.***
