The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified and the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are as defined. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative; otherwise, `d` is non-negative.**
