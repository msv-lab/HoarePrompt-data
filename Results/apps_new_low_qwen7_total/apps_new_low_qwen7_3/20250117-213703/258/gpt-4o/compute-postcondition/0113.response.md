The code updates the value of `d` to `c1 * T - c2 * T`. This directly replaces the existing value of `d` from the previous calculation, which was `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` is the value of `x2` before the swap, `y1` is the value of `y2` before the swap, `c1` is the value of `c2` before the swap, `x2` is the value of the original `x1`, `y2` is the value of the original `y1`, `c2` is the value of the original `c1`, `d` is now `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`, `count` is less than `K`, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.
