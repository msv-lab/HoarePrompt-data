To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the given code and determine the effects of each operation on the variables. Let's start with the initial state and then go through the code line by line.

### Initial State:
- `x1` is `x2`
- `y1` is `y2`
- `c1` is `c2`
- `x2` is `x1`
- `y2` is `y1`
- `c2` is `c1`
- `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\)
- `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\)
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\)
- If \(d \times d2 > d2\), the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

### Code Execution:

1. **Line 1:**
   ```python
   mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
   ```
   This line updates `mx` using the formula. Since `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `0`, the term under the square root becomes `0`, resulting in `sqrt(0)` being `0`. Therefore:
   \[
   mx = cx + 0 = cx
   \]

2. **Line 2:**
   ```python
   my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
   ```
   Similar to the previous line, since the term under the square root is `0`, the expression simplifies to:
   \[
   my = cy - 0 = cy
   \]

3. **Line 3:**
   ```python
   count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y, c in meats)
   ```
   This line calculates `count` by summing up the values of `c` for which the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`. However, the values of `mx` and `my` remain unchanged from their previous values due to the previous lines. Thus, the calculation depends on the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` from the list `meats`.

Given that `mx = cx` and `my = cy`, and the distances are calculated based on these values, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

### Final Output State:
- `x1` is `x2`
- `y1` is `y2`
- `c1` is `c2`
- `x2` is `x1`
- `y2` is `y1`
- `c2` is `c1`
- `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\)
- `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\)
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\)
- `mx` is `cx`
- `my` is `cy`
- `count` is the sum of `c` values where the condition \(c \times \sqrt{(cx - x) ^ 2 + (cy - y) ^ 2} \leq T\) holds true for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: x1 is x2, y1 is y2, c1 is c2, x2 is x1, y2 is y1, c2 is c1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is ((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2, mx is cx, my is cy, count is sum of c where condition holds true**
