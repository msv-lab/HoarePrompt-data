Postcondition: ***`d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `x1` is unchanged, `y1` is unchanged, `c1` is unchanged, `x2` is unchanged, `y2` is unchanged, `c2` is unchanged. If `d * d2 > d2`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no change in the else part.***
