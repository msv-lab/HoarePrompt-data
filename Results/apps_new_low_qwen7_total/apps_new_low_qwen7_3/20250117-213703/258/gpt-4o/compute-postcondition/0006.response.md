Output State: **N is an integer greater than 1, K is an integer, meats is a list of tuples containing [(4, 5, 6), (x_val, y_val, c_val), (x, y, c)], index is 15**

Explanation:
- Initially, `meats` is a list containing one tuple: `[(4, 5, 6)]`.
- `index` is 12.
- The first line `x = int(data[index])` retrieves the integer at position `index` (which is 12) in the `data` list and assigns it to `x`. After this assignment, `x` is the integer at `data[12]`, let's call it `x_val`.
- The second line `y = int(data[index + 1])` retrieves the integer at position `index + 1` (which is 13) in the `data` list and assigns it to `y`. After this assignment, `y` is the integer at `data[13]`, let's call it `y_val`.
- The third line `c = int(data[index + 2])` retrieves the integer at position `index + 2` (which is 14) in the `data` list and assigns it to `c`. After this assignment, `c` is the integer at `data[14]`, let's call it `c_val`.
- The fourth line `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. Therefore, `meats` now contains `[(4, 5, 6), (x_val, y_val, c_val)]`.
- The fifth line `index += 3` increments `index` by 3, making `index` equal to 15.
- No changes were made to `N`, `K`, or `x_val`, `y_val`, `c_val`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
- The final state of the variables is as described above.
