The variables in the loop head are `high` and `low`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `high - low > 1e-07`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition must be evaluated to be true for the loop to execute again.

Given the two possible states from the previous iteration:
1. `high` is equal to (`low` + `high`) / 2.
2. `low` is equal to (`low` + `high`) / 2.

Let's consider each case:

1. If `high` is equal to (`low` + `high`) / 2, then the loop can proceed if `low` is such that `high - low > 1e-07`.
2. If `low` is equal to (`low` + `high`) / 2, then the loop can proceed if `high` is such that `high - low > 1e-07`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that the difference between `high` and `low` is still greater than `1e-07` for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust the states to maintain this condition.

State: **`func_1(meats, K, mid)` must evaluate to True; `high` and `low` must be such that `high - low > 1e-07`**
