Postcondition: ***`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `cx`, `cy` is `cy`, `dx` is `dx`, `dy` is `dy`, `d2` is `d2`, `mx` is `mx`, `my` is `my`, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `count` is the final value that caused the function to return `True`. If `d` is less than 0, the conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part's postcondition.***
