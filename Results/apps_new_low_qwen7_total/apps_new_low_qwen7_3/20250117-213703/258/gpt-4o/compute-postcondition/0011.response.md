The code updates the value of `low` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) / 2`, the value of `low` is now set to this expression. The precondition that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` must evaluate to True remains unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `low` is equal to (`low` + `high`) / 2**
