The code assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. The initial conditions are that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True, `high - low > 1e-07`, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`. After executing the line `high = mid`, the value of `high` changes to `mid`, but the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `high - low > 1e-07`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`; `high` is equal to `mid`**
