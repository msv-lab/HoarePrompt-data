Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `count` is the number of iterations.
   - The loop condition is `j in range(i + 1, N)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is some value (let's call it `C`), and `i` and `N` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be in the range `(i + 1, N)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` would have been set to `i + 1 + count` (since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration).

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented at the start of each new iteration.
   - The variable `count` will also be incremented at the start of each new iteration.
   - The variables `i` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

4. **New States**:
   - `count` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value `C` to `C + 1`.
   - `j` will be set to `i + 1 + (C + 1)`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is C + 1, `j` is i + 1 + (C + 1)**

Given that `C` was the value of `count` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize this to:

State: **`count` is C + 1, `j` is i + C + 2**
