The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not affect the values of variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `c1 * T`, `c2 * T`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `d` is less than 0**
