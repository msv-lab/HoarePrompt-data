The `continue` statement in this context does not affect the values of the variables `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, or the condition `d * d2 > d2`. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true.**
