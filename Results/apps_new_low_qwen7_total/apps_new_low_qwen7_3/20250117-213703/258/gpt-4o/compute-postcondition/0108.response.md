Postcondition: **d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2), count is the number of elements in 'meats' that satisfy the condition, i is i + 1, N is greater than i + 1, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, count is less than K**
