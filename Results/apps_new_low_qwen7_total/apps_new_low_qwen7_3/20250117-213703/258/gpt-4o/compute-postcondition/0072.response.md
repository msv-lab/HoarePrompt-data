The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was entered before this statement, the variables `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - x2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`**
