The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **d is d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, count is unchanged, j is unchanged, x1 is unchanged, y1 is unchanged, c1 is unchanged, x2 is unchanged, y2 is unchanged, c2 is unchanged**
