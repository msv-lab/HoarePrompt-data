The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply moves on without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`count` is `(C + 1)`, `j` is `(i + C + 2)`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`**
