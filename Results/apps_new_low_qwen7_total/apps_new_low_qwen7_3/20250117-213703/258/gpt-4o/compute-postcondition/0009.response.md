The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `data`, which is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. The parameter constraints are that N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N. Each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c), where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100, and no two pieces of meat have the same coordinates.

The function returns a value based on the input data, but the specific output is not detailed in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a string `data` containing space-separated integers and coordinates of meat pieces, and return a value based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter data, which is a string containing space-separated integers and coordinates of meat pieces, and returns a value based on the input data.**
