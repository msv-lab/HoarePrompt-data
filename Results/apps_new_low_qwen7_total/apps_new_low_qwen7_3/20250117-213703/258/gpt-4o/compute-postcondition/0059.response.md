Postcondition: ***`d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`. If the condition `d * d2 > d2` is true, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
