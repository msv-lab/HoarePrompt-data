The `continue` statement in the code does not affect the values of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of a loop without executing the remaining part of the current iteration. Since there is no loop context given in the initial state, we assume this `continue` statement is within an implied loop. However, since the loop context is not explicitly defined, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **d is d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, x1 is the value of the original x2, y1 is the value of the original y2, c1 is the value of the original c2, x2 is the value of the original x1, y2 is the value of the original y1, c2 is the value of the original c1, d, cx, cy, dx, dy, and d2 are updated, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
