Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a single input string `data`, which contains space-separated integers and coordinates of meat pieces. It processes this input to extract the number of pieces of meat `N`, the integer `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. After extracting this information, it calls another function `func_2` with the extracted values. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_2` formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or incorrect spacing, which would cause the function to fail when attempting to split or convert the input string. Additionally, if `N` exceeds the allowed limit of 60 or `K` is greater than `N`, these conditions are not explicitly handled within the provided code.**

**Summary of the final state after the program concludes:**
- The function processes an input string `data` to extract the number of pieces of meat `N`, the integer `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.
- It then calls another function `func_2` with these values.
- The result of `func_2` is printed, formatted to six decimal places.
- If any input validation errors occur (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect formatting), the function will raise an exception or behave unpredictably.
