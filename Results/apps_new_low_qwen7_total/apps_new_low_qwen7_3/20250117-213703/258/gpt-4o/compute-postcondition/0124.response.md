The code swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. The initial values of `(x1, y1, c1)` become the values of `(x2, y2, c2)` before the swap, and the initial values of `(x2, y2, c2)` become the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` after the swap. 

Output State: **`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`**
