Given the initial state where `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is a list of tuples containing up to `N` elements (each element is a tuple of the form `(x, y, c)`), and `index` is `3 + 3 * N`, we need to execute the following code:

```python
result = func_2(N, K, meats)
print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, the code sets `result` to the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)` and then prints it formatted to six decimal places. The value of `index` is not changed by this code, and no other variables are modified.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the introduction of the variable `result` which now holds the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and the potential change in `index` due to the call to `func_2` (if `func_2` modifies `index`).

Output State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, meats is a list of tuples containing up to N elements (each element is a tuple of the form (x, y, c)), index is 3 + 3 * N, result is the return value of func_2(N, K, meats)**
