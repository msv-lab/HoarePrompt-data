The `continue` statement in this context simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\)**
