Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100; `low` is approximately 500000000.0, `high` is approximately 1000000000.0, `mid` is approximately 500000000.0. `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True, and `high - low <= 1e-07`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   The loop continues as long as the difference between `high` and `low` is greater than \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is 1000000000.0. The variable `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
   - `mid` is recalculated after each iteration.
   - `low` and `high` are invariant in terms of their role in updating `mid`, but their values change over iterations.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After each iteration, `mid` is recalculated as \((low + high) / 2\).
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` is true, `high` is set to `mid`.
   - If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` is false, `low` is set to `mid`.
   - This process narrows down the range between `low` and `high` until the condition `high - low <= 1e-07` is met.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Given that the loop exits when `high - low <= 1e-07`, both `low` and `high` will be very close to each other, approximately 500000000.0.
   - Since `mid` is always the midpoint of `low` and `high`, it will also be approximately 500000000.0.
   - `func_1(meats, K, mid)` must evaluate to True for the loop to terminate with the specified conditions.

Thus, the final state of the loop will be as stated above.
