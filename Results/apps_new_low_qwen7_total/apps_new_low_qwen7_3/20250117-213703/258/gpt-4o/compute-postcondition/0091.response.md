Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(N):`, so the only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `d` is `d`
   - `cx` is `cx`
   - `cy` is `cy`
   - `dx` is `dx`
   - `dy` is `dy`
   - `d2` is `d2`
   - `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
   - `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
   - `count` is the final value that caused the function to return True.

3. Understand how `i` changes in each iteration:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `k`, then `i` becomes `k + 1` in the next iteration.

4. Adjust the states for the next iteration:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be `i + 1`.
   - All other variables remain the same as they are not affected by the loop itself but by the loop body (which is omitted).

5. Construct the new state:
   - `d` remains `d`
   - `cx` remains `cx`
   - `cy` remains `cy`
   - `dx` remains `dx`
   - `dy` remains `dy`
   - `d2` remains `d2`
   - `mx` remains `mx`
   - `my` remains `my`
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`
   - `count` remains the final value that caused the function to return True.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`d` is `d`, `cx` is `cx`, `cy` is `cy`, `dx` is `dx`, `dy` is `dy`, `d2` is `d2`, `mx` is `mx`, `my` is `my`, `i` is `i + 1`, `count` is the final value that caused the function to return True**.
