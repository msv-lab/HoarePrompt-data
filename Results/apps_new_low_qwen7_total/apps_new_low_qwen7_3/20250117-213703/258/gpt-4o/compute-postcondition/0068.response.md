`d` is assigned the value `c1 * T - c2 * T`. According to the initial state, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the condition holds true, meaning `d` will be a negative value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are as defined. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative; otherwise, `d` is non-negative.**
