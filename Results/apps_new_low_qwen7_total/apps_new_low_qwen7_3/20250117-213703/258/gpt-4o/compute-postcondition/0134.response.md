Postcondition: **`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\), `mx` is `cx`, `my` is `cy`, `count` is the sum of `c` values where the condition \(c \times \sqrt{(cx - x) ^ 2 + (cy - y) ^ 2} \leq T\) holds true for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats`. If `count >= K`, then the function does not change the variables' values. Otherwise, the function does not change the variables' values.**
