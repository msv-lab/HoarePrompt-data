Initial State: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 3, the counter generated by `range(N)` must be 0

Given Code:
```
x = int(data[index])
y = int(data[index + 1])
c = int(data[index + 2])
meats.append((x, y, c))
index += 3
```

Analysis:
- The code attempts to extract three integers from the `data` list at positions `index`, `index + 1`, and `index + 2` respectively.
- These integers are converted to integers using `int()` and then appended as a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list.
- After appending, `index` is incremented by 3.

Since the initial state does not specify the content of the `data` list or the exact values of `N` and `K`, we need to assume some values to proceed. However, since no specific values are provided, let's assume hypothetical values for demonstration purposes. For instance, let's assume `data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

Execution:
1. `x = int(data[index])`: With `index` being 3, `x` becomes `int(4)`, so `x` is 4.
2. `y = int(data[index + 1])`: With `index` being 3, `y` becomes `int(5)`, so `y` is 5.
3. `c = int(data[index + 2])`: With `index` being 3, `c` becomes `int(6)`, so `c` is 6.
4. `meats.append((x, y, c))`: The list `meats` is updated to contain `[ (4, 5, 6) ]`.
5. `index += 3`: `index` is updated to 6.

Final State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, meats is [(4, 5, 6)], index is 6**

Note: The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged as they were not referenced or modified in the code block.
