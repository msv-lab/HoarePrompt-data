Based on the initial state and the given condition, we need to determine the values of `c1`, `c2`, and `T` to proceed. However, since the value of `T` is not specified, we will consider both scenarios based on the provided condition.

**Scenario 1:**
If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then:
- `x1` is 40
- `y1` is 50
- `c1` is 60
- `x2` is 10
- `y2` is 20
- `c2` is 30

In this case, `d = c1 * T - c2 * T = 60 * T - 30 * T = 30 * T`.

**Scenario 2:**
If `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, then:
- `x1` is 10
- `y1` is 20
- `c1` is 30
- `x2` is 40
- `y2` is 50
- `c2` is 60

In this case, `d = c1 * T - c2 * T = 30 * T - 60 * T = -30 * T`.

Therefore, the output state depends on which scenario applies:

**Output State:**
- If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then **`d` is 30 * T, `x1` is 40, `y1` is 50, `c1` is 60, `x2` is 10, `y2` is 20, `c2` is 30**.
- If `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, then **`d` is -30 * T, `x1` is 10, `y1` is 20, `c1` is 30, `x2` is 40, `y2` is 50, `c2` is 60**.

Since the exact value of `T` is not specified, both conditions are valid based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
