The code snippet assigns the value of `(low + high) / 2` to the variable `mid`. This does not affect the values of `func_1`, `meats`, `K`, `mid`, `high`, or `low` directly, but it does change the value of `mid`. Given the precondition that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` must evaluate to `True` and `high - low > 1e-07`, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `high - low > 1e-07`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`**
