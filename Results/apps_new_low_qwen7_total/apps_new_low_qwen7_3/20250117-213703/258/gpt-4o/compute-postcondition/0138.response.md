The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: `x_i`, `y_i`, and `c_i` (coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat).
- `K` is an integer such that `1 <= K <= len(meats)`.
- `T` is a non-negative floating-point number representing a potential time value.

Based on the provided cases, the function returns either `True` or `False`. Since all cases except one return `True`, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to check a specific condition related to the input parameters and return `True` unless a certain condition leads to a return of `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `meats`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative floating-point number `T`. It returns `True` in most cases and returns `False` in one case.**
