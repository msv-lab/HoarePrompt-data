Postcondition: **`d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `count` is the final value that caused the function to return True, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`. The condition `d * d2 > d2` is satisfied.**
