The code swaps the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Let's break down the changes:

- `x1` was originally the x-coordinate of `meats[i]`.
- `y1` was originally the y-coordinate of `meats[i]`.
- `c1` was originally the value from `meats[i]`.

- `x2` was originally the x-coordinate of `meats[j + 1]`.
- `y2` was originally the y-coordinate of `meats[j + 1]`.
- `c2` was originally the value from `meats[j + 1]`.

After the swap:
- `x1` now holds the value of `x2`.
- `y1` now holds the value of `y2`.
- `c1` now holds the value of `c2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is unchanged, `cx` is unchanged, `cy` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `d2` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `my` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, `c2` is the original value of `c1`**.
