The code snippet performs a tuple assignment, swapping the values of `(x1, y1, c1)` with `(x2, y2, c2)`. Let's analyze the changes:

- Initially, `x1` is 10, `y1` is 20, `c1` is 30.
- Initially, `x2` is 40, `y2` is 50, `c2` is 60.
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true because 30 * T < 60 * T is valid for any positive value of T.

After the tuple assignment, the new values are:
- `x1` becomes `x2`, which is 40.
- `y1` becomes `y2`, which is 50.
- `c1` becomes `c2`, which is 60.
- `x2` becomes the original value of `x1`, which is 10.
- `y2` becomes the original value of `y1`, which is 20.
- `c2` becomes the original value of `c1`, which is 30.

The output state is:
Output State: **`x1` is 40, `y1` is 50, `c1` is 60, `x2` is 10, `y2` is 20, `c2` is 30**
