Postcondition: ***`func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True; `high - low > 1e-07`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) / 2`. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True and `high - low > 1e-07`, then after executing the if block, `high` is equal to `mid`. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to True and `high - low > 1e-07`, then after executing the else block, `low` is equal to `mid`.***
