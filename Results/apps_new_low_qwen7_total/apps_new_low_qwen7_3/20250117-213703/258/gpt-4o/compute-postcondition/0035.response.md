Postcondition: ***`count` is `C + 1`, `j` is `i + C + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned values from the list `meats` at positions `i` and `j`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is the original value of `x2`, `y1` is the original value of `y2`, and `c1` is the original value of `c2`; otherwise, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain unchanged.***
