Postcondition: ***`x1` is the value of `x2` before the swap, `y1` is the value of `y2` before the swap, `c1` is the value of `c2` before the swap, `x2` is the value of the original `x1`, `y2` is the value of the original `y1`, `c2` is the value of the original `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`, `count` is less than `K`, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`. If `d < 0`, then `mx` is `cx - dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy + dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` otherwise.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts, and maintains the conditions stated in the precondition.
