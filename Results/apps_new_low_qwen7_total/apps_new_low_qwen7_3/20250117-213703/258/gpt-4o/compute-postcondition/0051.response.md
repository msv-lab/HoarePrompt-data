Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are integers. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is 40, `y1` is 50, `c1` is 60, `x2` is 10, `y2` is 20, `c2` is 30. If `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, the initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` (i.e., `x1` is 10, `y1` is 20, `c1` is 30, `x2` is 40, `y2` is 50, `c2` is 60) remain unchanged.***
