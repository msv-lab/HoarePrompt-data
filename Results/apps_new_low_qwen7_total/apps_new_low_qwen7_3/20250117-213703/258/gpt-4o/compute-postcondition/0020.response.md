The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N.
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100.

The function returns a value `high` which is approximately 1000000000.0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, and return a value `high` which is approximately 1000000000.0.
