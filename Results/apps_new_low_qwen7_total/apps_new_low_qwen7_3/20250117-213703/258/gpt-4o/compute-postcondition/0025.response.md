Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are elements from the ith and jth tuples in `meats`. If the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is met, `x1` is set to the original `x2`, `y1` is set to the original `y2`, `c1` is set to the original `c2`, `x2` is set to the original `x1`, `y2` is set to the original `y1`, `c2` is set to the original `c1`, and `d` is assigned the value `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
