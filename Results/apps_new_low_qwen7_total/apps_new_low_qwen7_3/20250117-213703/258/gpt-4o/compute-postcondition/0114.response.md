The `continue` statement in the given code does not change any variable values but instead skips to the next iteration of the loop it is within. Since there is no explicit loop in the provided code snippet (other than the implied loop from the context of the `continue` statement), the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x1` is the value of `x2` before the swap, `y1` is the value of `y2` before the swap, `c1` is the value of `c2` before the swap, `x2` is the value of the original `x1`, `y2` is the value of the original `y1`, `c2` is the value of the original `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`, `count` is less than `K`, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
