Postcondition: ***`d` is `d`, `cx` is `cx`, `cy` is `cy`, `dx` is `dx`, `dy` is `dy`, `d2` is `d2`, `mx` is `mx`, `my` is `my`, `i` is `i + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `count` is the final value that caused the function to return `True`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` is `x2` and `y1` is `y2`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
