The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop without executing the remaining part of the body of the loop. However, since the initial state and the conditions for updating the variables are defined outside the loop context, and there is no loop here, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only action taken is that if the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is met, the variables are swapped, and `d` is assigned the value `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Since the `continue` statement does not affect the variables and exits the current iteration (if in a loop), the values of the variables stay as they were before the condition was checked.

Therefore, the Output State remains: **`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are elements from the ith and jth tuples in `meats`; if the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is met, `x1` is equal to the original `x2`, `y1` is equal to the original `y2`, `c1` is equal to the original `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and `d` is assigned the value `c1 * T - c2 * T`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
