Postcondition: ***`count` is `(C + 1)`, `j` is `(i + C + 2)`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`. If `d * d2 > d2`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
