Output State: **d is d, cx is cx, cy is cy, dx is dx, dy is dy, d2 is d2, mx is cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, my is cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d - d * d) / d2, count is sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x))), j is i + 2, x1 is meats[i][0], y1 is meats[i][1], c1 is meats[i][2], x2 is meats[j][0], y2 is meats[j][1], c2 is meats[j][2]**

Explanation:
- The first line `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` unpacks the tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list into `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.
- The second line `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` unpacks the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list into `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`.

No other variables are affected by these two lines. The values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
