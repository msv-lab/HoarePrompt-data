Postcondition: ***`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is \((c1 \times T - c2 \times T) / (c1 \times c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2\). If \(d \times d2 > d2\), the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
