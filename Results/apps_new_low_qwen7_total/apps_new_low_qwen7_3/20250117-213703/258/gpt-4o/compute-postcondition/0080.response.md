Postcondition: ***`d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is the original value of `x1`, `y2` is the original value of `y1`, and `c2` is the original value of `c1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
