To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

Given:
- `N` is an integer
- `K` is an integer
- `meats` is an empty list
- `index` is 3

Loop structure:
```
for _ in range(N):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Range Function**: The `range(N)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to \(N-1\). This means the loop will iterate `N` times.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute the first time, the value of the counter used by `range(N)` must be 0. The counter is incremented after each iteration.

3. **Initial Value of Counter**: In the loop, `_` (a dummy variable) is used, but it still increments as part of the loop's mechanism. Therefore, we need to check the condition just before the loop starts.

4. **Objects Involved**: The only object involved in controlling the loop execution is the counter generated by `range(N)`, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration.

5. **Ensuring First Iteration**: For the first iteration of the loop, the counter value must be 0. This ensures that the loop body will be executed at least once.

6. **Other Variables**: The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `index` do not directly control the loop execution based on the given code snippet. They might affect other parts of the program, but they do not influence the loop's first iteration condition.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the counter generated by `range(N)` must be 0.

State: **`N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 3, the counter generated by `range(N)` must be 0**
