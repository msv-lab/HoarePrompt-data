The `continue` statement in a loop does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables remain unchanged. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x1` is 5, `y1` is 10, `c1` is 6, `x2` is 10, `y2` is 20, `c2` is 3, `d` is 1/3, `cx` is 7.5, `cy` is 15, `dx` is -2.5, `dy` is -5, `d2` is 31.25**
