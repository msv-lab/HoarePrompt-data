The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement immediately surrounding the `continue` statement, it does not affect any variables and simply skips to the next iteration if it were in a loop context.

Given the initial state:
- `x1` is `x2`
- `y1` is `y2`
- `c1` is `c2`
- `x2` is `x1`
- `y2` is `y1`
- `c2` is `c1`
- `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`

Since `continue` does not alter any variable values or create any new conditions, the values remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `x1`, `y2` is `y1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`**
