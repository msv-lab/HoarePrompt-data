Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60.
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N.
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, with -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100.

The function uses a binary search approach to find a value `high` within a range [0, 1000000000.0] that satisfies a certain condition determined by the function `func_1`. Specifically, it repeatedly narrows down the range by adjusting `low` and `high` until the difference between them is less than 1e-07. During each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and checks if `func_1(meats, K, mid)` returns True. If it does, `high` is set to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

After the loop, the function returns the value of `high`, which is approximately 1000000000.0.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `N` is 1, the function still proceeds as normal since the condition 1 <= K <= N is satisfied.
- If `K` is 1, the function will still execute correctly, though the specific behavior might depend on the values in `meats`.

There is no missing functionality in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the operations performed by the code.**

This summary covers the essential aspects of the function's operation and includes the potential edge cases mentioned.
