Postcondition: ***d is d / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is dx * dx + dy * dy, x1 is the value of the original x2, y1 is the value of the original y2, c1 is the value of the original c2, x2 is the value of the original x1, y2 is the value of the original y1, c2 is the value of the original c1, d, cx, cy, dx, dy, and d2 are updated, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop if d * d2 > d2, otherwise no further updates are made.***
