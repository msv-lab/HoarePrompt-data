Output State: **x1 is x2, y1 is y2, c1 is c2, x2 is x1, y2 is y1, c2 is c1, d is (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), cx is (x1 + x2) / 2, cy is (y1 + y2) / 2, dx is (x1 - x2) / 2, dy is (y1 - y2) / 2, d2 is ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)**

Explanation:
1. The line `d /= c1 * c2` divides the current value of `d` by `c1 * c2`. Since `d` was initially `c1 * T - c2 * T`, it becomes `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
2. The line `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2` calculates the average of `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `cx`.
3. The line `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2` calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`.
4. The line `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2` calculates half the difference between `x1` and `x2` and assigns it to `dx`.
5. The line `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2` calculates half the difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `dy`.
6. The line `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` calculates the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy` and assigns it to `d2`. This expression simplifies to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial values.
