The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains the coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` and hardness `c_i` of a piece of meat, an integer `K` such that `1 <= K <= len(meats)`, and a non-negative floating-point number `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meats, comparing their hardness adjusted by `T`. For each pair, it calculates a new position `(mx, my)` and checks if there are at least `K` pieces of meat within a certain distance from this position, defined by the adjusted hardness and `T`. If such a configuration is found, the function returns `True`. If no such configuration is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`.

The function does not handle edge cases where `meats` is an empty list or `K` is out of bounds (i.e., `K < 1` or `K > len(meats)`). If `meats` is an empty list, the function should ideally return `False`. Additionally, while the code checks if `count >= K`, it does not explicitly handle the case where `count == K - 1` or when no pairs satisfy the condition.
