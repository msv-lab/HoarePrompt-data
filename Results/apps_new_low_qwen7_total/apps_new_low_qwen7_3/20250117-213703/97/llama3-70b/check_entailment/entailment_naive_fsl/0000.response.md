Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `path(x)` function as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly generate the path for a given `x`. The issue lies in the loop condition and the update of `x` inside the loop. The loop should continue until `x` becomes 1, but the current implementation updates `x` incorrectly, leading to incorrect paths being generated.

For example, consider `path(15)`:
- According to the problem description, `path(15)` should be `[15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1]`.
- However, the current implementation will generate an incorrect sequence because it does not properly handle the transformation rules and the loop termination condition.

To fix this, the loop should continue until `x` becomes 1, and the transformation rules should be applied correctly within the loop. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            x = x // 2
        else:
            x = x - 1
        res.append(x)
    return res
```

This corrected function will generate the correct path for any given `x`, ensuring that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
