The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` as a parameter. If `x` is even, it returns `x // 2`. If `x` is odd, it returns `x - 1`. The function handles both even and odd inputs correctly, reducing the value of `x` in a specific way depending on its parity. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need additional consideration, as the logic for handling even and odd numbers is straightforward and complete. After the function concludes, the return value will either be half of the original even `x` or one less than the original odd `x`.
