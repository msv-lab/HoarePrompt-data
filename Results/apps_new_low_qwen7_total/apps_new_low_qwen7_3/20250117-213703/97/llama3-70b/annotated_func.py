#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x):
    if (x % 2 == 0) :
        return x // 2
        #The program returns x // 2, where x is a non-negative integer and its current value is even
    else :
        return x - 1
        #The program returns x - 1, where x is a non-negative odd integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` as a parameter. If `x` is even, it returns `x // 2`. If `x` is odd, it returns `x - 1`. The function handles both even and odd inputs correctly, reducing the value of `x` in a specific way depending on its parity. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need additional consideration, as the logic for handling even and odd numbers is straightforward and complete. After the function concludes, the return value will either be half of the original even `x` or one less than the original odd `x`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_2(x):
    res = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = func_1(x)
        
        res.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x is 1, res is a list containing all values of x from the initial value down to 1.
    return res
    #The program returns a list `res` containing all values of `x` from the initial value 1 down to 1, which is [1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (such that 1 <= x <= n). It then repeatedly calls `func_1(x)` until `x` becomes 1, appending each intermediate value of `x` to a list `res`. After the loop terminates, the function returns the list `res`, which contains all the values of `x` starting from the initial value down to 1. 

However, there is a potential issue with the current implementation. The annotation suggests that the function starts with `x` being a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, but the actual code does not check if `x` is within this range before proceeding. If `x` is outside this range, the function will not behave as expected and may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

Additionally, the annotation mentions that the function returns a list containing all values of `x` from the initial value down to 1, which is [1]. However, the current implementation only appends `x` to the list `res` after `x` has been modified by `func_1(x)`. This means that the initial value of `x` will not be included in the list `res`. Therefore, the returned list should actually start from the value of `x` passed to the function and end with 1.

To address these issues, the function should first validate that `x` is within the required range, and it should append the initial value of `x` to the list `res` before entering the loop.
