The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` (such that 1 <= x <= n). It then repeatedly calls `func_1(x)` until `x` becomes 1, appending each intermediate value of `x` to a list `res`. After the loop terminates, the function returns the list `res`, which contains all the values of `x` starting from the initial value down to 1. 

However, there is a potential issue with the current implementation. The annotation suggests that the function starts with `x` being a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, but the actual code does not check if `x` is within this range before proceeding. If `x` is outside this range, the function will not behave as expected and may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

Additionally, the annotation mentions that the function returns a list containing all values of `x` from the initial value down to 1, which is [1]. However, the current implementation only appends `x` to the list `res` after `x` has been modified by `func_1(x)`. This means that the initial value of `x` will not be included in the list `res`. Therefore, the returned list should actually start from the value of `x` passed to the function and end with 1.

To address these issues, the function should first validate that `x` is within the required range, and it should append the initial value of `x` to the list `res` before entering the loop.
