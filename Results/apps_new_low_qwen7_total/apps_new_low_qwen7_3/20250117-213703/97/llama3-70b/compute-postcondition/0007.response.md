To determine the output state after all executions of the loop, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: 
  - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\).
  - `res` is a list containing the value `x`.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
- During each iteration:
  - `x` is updated to `func_1(x)`.
  - `res` appends the current value of `x`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
- Each time the loop runs, `x` is replaced by the output of `func_1(x)`, and this new value of `x` is appended to the list `res`.
- Since `func_1(x)` always returns a positive integer (as implied by the problem statement), the loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes 1.
- The list `res` will contain all intermediate values of `x` until it reaches 1.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop will terminate when `x == 1`.
- Therefore, the final value of `x` will be 1.
- The final state of `res` will be a list containing all values of `x` from the initial state down to 1.

### Final Output State
- After the loop completes, `x` will be 1.
- `res` will be a list of all intermediate values of `x` from the initial value down to 1.

Output State: **x is 1, res is a list containing all values of x from the initial value down to 1.**
