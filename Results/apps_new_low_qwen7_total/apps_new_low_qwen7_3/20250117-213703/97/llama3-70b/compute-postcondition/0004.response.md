Initial State: `x` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `res` is a list containing `x`

Code Block:
```
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Analysis:
- The first line `x = func_1(x)` updates `x` to the value returned by `func_1(x)`. Since `x` is initially a positive integer not equal to 1, let's denote it as `x_initial`.
- The second line `res.append(x)` appends the new value of `x` to the list `res`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not given and we know `x` is a positive integer not equal to 1, we can denote the updated `x` as `x_updated` which is the return value of `func_1(x_initial)`.

Final Output State: **x is x_updated (where x_updated = func_1(x_initial)), res is [x_initial, x_updated]**
