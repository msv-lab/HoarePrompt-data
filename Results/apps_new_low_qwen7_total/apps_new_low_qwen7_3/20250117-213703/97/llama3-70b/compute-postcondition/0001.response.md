Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `x != 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: According to the provided state, `x` is a positive integer such that `1 <= x <= n`, and `res` is a list containing the value `x`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Condition**: Since the loop requires `x` to not be equal to 1 to execute, and given that `x` is initially a positive integer between 1 and `n`, the only constraint we need to consider here is ensuring `x` is not 1. The initial value of `x` being within the range `[1, n]` does not affect the loop condition directly since any value of `x` in this range (except 1) would allow the loop to execute.

5. **Final State for Loop Execution**: Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `x` is not 1.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n and x must not be 1**
