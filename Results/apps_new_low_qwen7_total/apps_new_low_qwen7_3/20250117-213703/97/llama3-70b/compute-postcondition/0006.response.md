Given the initial state where `x` is `x_updated` and `x_updated` is not equal to 1, and `res` is `[x, x_updated]`, we need to execute the following code block:

```python
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Since `func_1` is not defined, let's assume it returns `x` itself (a common default behavior if no specific function is provided). This means that the line `x = func_1(x)` would simply set `x` to its own value, which is `x_updated`.

After this assignment, `x` still holds the value `x_updated`. The next line appends `x` to the list `res`, so `res` becomes `[x, x_updated, x_updated]`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **x is x_updated, x_updated is not equal to 1, res is [x_updated, x_updated, x_updated]**
