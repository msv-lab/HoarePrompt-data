Initial State: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n and x must not be 1

```
x = func_1(x)
res.append(x)
```

Analysis:
- The first line `x = func_1(x)` calls the function `func_1` with the current value of `x` and assigns the returned value back to `x`.
- The second line `res.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `res`.

Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific new value of `x` after calling `func_1(x)`. However, we know that `x` must not be 1 according to the initial condition. After executing the code, `x` will retain the value it gets from `func_1(x)` and will be added to the list `res`.

Output State: **x is the result of func_1(x), which is a positive integer not equal to 1, res is a list containing x**
