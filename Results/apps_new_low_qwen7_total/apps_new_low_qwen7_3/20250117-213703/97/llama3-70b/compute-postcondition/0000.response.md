`res` is assigned the value `[x]`. This means `res` is now a list containing the single element `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n; `res` is a list containing the value `x`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n; `res` is a list containing the value `x`.**
