Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the result of `func_1(x)`, which is a positive integer not equal to 1, and `res` is a list containing `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1. Since `x` is already given as a positive integer not equal to 1, no adjustment is necessary for `x` to meet the loop condition.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

Since `x` is already a positive integer not equal to 1, it satisfies the loop condition `x != 1`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

4. **Other States**: The state of `res` is irrelevant to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is the result of `func_1(x)`, which is a positive integer not equal to 1, `res` is a list containing `x`**
