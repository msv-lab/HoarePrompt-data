Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Identify the loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is equal to `x_updated`, where `x_updated = func_1(x_initial)`.
4. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Given that `x` is currently `x_updated`, and `x_updated` is the result of applying `func_1` to `x_initial`, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 1 for the next iteration.

Since `x` is `x_updated` and `x_updated` is the result of applying `func_1` to `x_initial`, we need to ensure that `x_updated` is not equal to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x_updated` (which is `x`) is not equal to 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is `x_updated` and `x_updated` is not equal to 1, `res` is [x_initial, x_updated]**
