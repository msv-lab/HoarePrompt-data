Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the movement pattern described. The program incorrectly calculates the coordinates after a certain number of moves. Specifically, the direction changes and the steps taken do not align with the spiral pattern as illustrated. For instance, when `n = 7`, the expected output is `(3, 2)`, but the program returns incorrect values. This indicates that the logic for determining the correct direction and step count is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
