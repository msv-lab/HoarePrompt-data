Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to move Ayrat along the spiral path on the hexagonal grid.
2. The `func_1` function initializes the starting position at `(0, 0)` and defines the six possible directions for movement.
3. The function uses a loop to process `n` moves, updating the coordinates `x` and `y` according to the current direction and the number of steps remaining.
4. The logic inside the function ensures that Ayrat follows the spiral pattern correctly:
   - It processes two segments of the spiral at a time.
   - It adjusts the direction index and the number of steps after each segment.
   - It handles the case where `n` is less than the current number of steps by directly calculating the remaining moves.
5. The implementation accounts for the boundary conditions correctly, especially when `n` is less than 2.
6. The program correctly reads the input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the resulting coordinates.

Given the detailed execution summary and the logical correctness of the implementation, the program appears to be functioning as intended.

Correctness: **True**
