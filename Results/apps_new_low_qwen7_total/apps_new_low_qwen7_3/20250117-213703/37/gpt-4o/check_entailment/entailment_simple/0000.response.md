Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the input `n` which represents the number of moves Ayrat makes on the hexagonal grid.
2. **Function Call**: It calls `func_1(n)` with the input and correctly prints the result.
3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The function initializes the starting position at `(0, 0)` and sets up a list of movement directions.
   - It uses a while loop to ensure all `n` moves are accounted for.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates twice per step to handle the two segments of each move pattern (the first segment moves one step at a time, the second segment moves multiple steps at a time).
   - The directions are cycled through every two iterations.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to the current step count (`steps`), it updates the position by multiplying the direction vector by `steps` and reduces `n` accordingly.
   - Otherwise, it updates the position by multiplying the direction vector by the remaining `n`.
   - It then returns the coordinates `(x, y)` once the remaining moves `n` are less than the current step count.
4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The logic handles the transition between different movement patterns correctly by updating the direction index every two iterations.
   - The final return statement ensures that the coordinates are correctly computed even when the exact number of moves does not perfectly align with the step size.
5. **Compliance with Constraints**: The solution is designed to handle large values of `n` (up to \(10^{18}\)) efficiently using the spiral pattern and modulo operations.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required behavior.

Correctness: **True**
