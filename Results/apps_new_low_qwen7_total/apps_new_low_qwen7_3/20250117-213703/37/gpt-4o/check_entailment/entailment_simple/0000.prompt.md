Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
-2 0

Input
7

Output
3 2

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]

x, y = 0, 0

steps = 1

direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return x, y
        
        steps += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: \( n = 0 \), \( x = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (dx_i \times i) + (dx_{k+1} \times (n \mod \text{steps})) \), \( y = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (dy_i \times i) + (dy_{k+1} \times (n \mod \text{steps})) \), \( \text{direction\_index} = (\text{direction\_index} + 2k) \% 6 \), \( \text{steps} = k + 1 \).
    return x, y
    #The program returns x and y, where x is the sum of dx_i * i for i from 1 to k, plus dx_{k+1} * (n mod steps), and y is the sum of dy_i * i for i from 1 to k, plus dy_{k+1} * (n mod steps)
