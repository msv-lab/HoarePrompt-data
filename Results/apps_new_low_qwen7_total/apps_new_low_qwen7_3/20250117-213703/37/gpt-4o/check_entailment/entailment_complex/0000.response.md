Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining Ayrat's position on the hexagonal grid after \( n \) moves. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the starting coordinates \((x, y) = (0, 0)\) and sets up the directions for movement.

2. **Direction Handling**: The directions are correctly defined for moving in a spiral pattern, which is a key requirement of the problem.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the number of moves \( n \) using a while loop.
   - It processes the moves in increments of the current step size `steps` until `n` is exhausted.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, it processes the moves in chunks of `steps`, updating the coordinates accordingly.
   - If `n` is less than `steps`, it processes the remaining moves directly, ensuring no extra steps are taken beyond `n`.

4. **Direction Index Update**: The direction index is correctly updated after each complete cycle of moves of size `steps`.

5. **Final Return**: The function correctly returns the coordinates `(x, y)` after processing all moves.

Given the above analysis, the program accurately follows the problem requirements and correctly computes the coordinates for any given \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
