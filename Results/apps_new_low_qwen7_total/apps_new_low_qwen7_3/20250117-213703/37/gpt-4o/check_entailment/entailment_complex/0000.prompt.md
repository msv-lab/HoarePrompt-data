Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined: 

[Image] [Image] Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point (0, 0) and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after n moves.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of Ayrat's moves.


-----Output-----

Print two integers x and y — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
-2 0

Input
7

Output

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input().strip())
(x, y) = func_1(n)
print(x, y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]

x, y = 0, 0

steps = 1

direction_index = 0
    while n > 0:
        for _ in range(2):
            if n >= steps:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * steps
                y += dy * steps
                n -= steps
                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
            else:
                dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
                x += dx * n
                y += dy * n
                return x, y
        
        steps += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: \( n = 0 \), \( x = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (dx_i \times i) + (dx_{k+1} \times (n \mod \text{steps})) \), \( y = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (dy_i \times i) + (dy_{k+1} \times (n \mod \text{steps})) \), \( \text{direction\_index} = (\text{direction\_index} + 2k) \% 6 \), \( \text{steps} = k + 1 \).
    return x, y
    #The program returns x and y, where x is the sum of dx_i * i for i from 1 to k, plus dx_{k+1} * (n mod steps), and y is the sum of dy_i * i for i from 1 to k, plus dy_{k+1} * (n mod steps)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It updates the coordinates `x` and `y` based on a series of directions defined in the `directions` list. The function returns the updated coordinates `(x, y)` after processing `n` according to the following rules:

1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than `steps`, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n` respectively, and the function returns the updated coordinates.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, the function processes `n` in chunks of `steps`, updating `x` and `y` by adding `dx * steps` and `dy * steps` twice per iteration, then updating `x` and `y` again by adding `dx * (n mod steps)` and `dy * (n mod steps)`. The direction index is updated accordingly, and the function returns the final coordinates.
3. If `n` is less than 2, the function directly updates `x` and `y` by adding `dx * n` and `dy * n` and returns the updated coordinates.
4. After each full cycle of updating `x` and `y` for `steps`, the `direction_index` and `steps` are adjusted, and the process continues until `n` becomes zero.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the coordinates `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are updated based on the above rules.
