`steps` is incremented by 1, which means `steps` will now be `steps + 1`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `direction_index`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`x` is 4 \* `dx` + 3 \* `dx` \* `steps`, `y` is 4 \* `dy` + 3 \* `dy` \* `steps`, `direction_index` = (`direction_index` + 3) \% 6, `n` = `n` - 3 \* `steps`, `steps` = `steps` + 1**
