Based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the effects of the code execution step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` is updated by adding `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dx * n` to its original value.
- `y` is updated by adding `2 * dy * steps` and `2 * dy * n` to its original value.
- `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

### Analysis:
1. **Line 1: `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`**
   - This line retrieves the x-component (`dx`) and y-component (`dy`) of the current direction from the `directions` list using the current value of `direction_index`.
   - The values of `dx` and `dy` are determined by the `directions` list and the current `direction_index`.

2. **Line 2: `x += dx * n`**
   - This line updates `x` by adding `dx * n` to its current value.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, so `dx * n` is added to `x`.

3. **Line 3: `y += dy * n`**
   - This line updates `y` by adding `dy * n` to its current value.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, so `dy * n` is added to `y`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `direction_index` remains unchanged because no assignment or update to `direction_index` is performed in the given code snippet.
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2 because no assignment or update to `n` is performed in the given code snippet.
- `x` is updated by adding `dx * n` to its current value.
- `y` is updated by adding `dy * n` to its current value.

### Final State:
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` is updated by adding `dx * n` to its current value.
- `y` is updated by adding `dy * n` to its current value.
- `direction_index` remains unchanged.

### Output State:
**n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, x is updated by adding dx * n to its current value, y is updated by adding dy * n to its current value, direction_index remains unchanged.**

So, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, x is updated by adding dx * n to its current value, y is updated by adding dy * n to its current value, direction_index remains unchanged**.
