Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is updated by adding `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dx * n` to its original value, `y` is updated by adding `2 * dy * steps` and `2 * dy * n` to its original value, `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `dx` is updated to the x-component of the new direction, and `dy` is updated to the y-component of the new direction. Otherwise, the function returns the updated values of `x` and `y`.**
