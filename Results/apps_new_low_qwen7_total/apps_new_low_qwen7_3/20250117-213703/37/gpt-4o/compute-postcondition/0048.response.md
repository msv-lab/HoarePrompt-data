Output State: **x is 2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps) + dx * (n - 3 * steps), y is 2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps) + dy * (n - 3 * steps), direction_index is (((direction_index + 3) % 6)), n is n - 3 * steps**

Explanation:
1. The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` updates the values of `dx` and `dy` based on the current `direction_index`.
2. The line `x += dx * n` adds `dx * n` to the current value of `x`. Given the initial state of `x`, this modifies `x` to `2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps) + dx * (n - 3 * steps)`.
3. The line `y += dy * n` adds `dy * n` to the current value of `y`. Given the initial state of `y`, this modifies `y` to `2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps) + dy * (n - 3 * steps)`.
4. The line `direction_index = ((direction_index + 3) % 6)` updates `direction_index` to the new value calculated by the expression.
5. The line `n -= 3 * steps` updates `n` to `n - 3 * steps`, ensuring it is still greater than 0 as per the initial condition.

Since no other variables are mentioned or modified, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
