Let's analyze the given code and determine the output state after the loop executes 3 times.

### Initial State:
- `x` is updated by `2 * dx`
- `y` is updated by `2 * dy`
- `direction_index` is updated by `(`direction_index + 2) % 6`
- `steps` is incremented by 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

### Code Block:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * steps
y += dy * steps
n -= steps
if n >= steps:
    direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6
return x, y
```

### Analysis:
The loop will execute as long as `n >= steps`. Each iteration of the loop updates `x`, `y`, `n`, and potentially `direction_index`.

#### Iteration 1:
- `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`
- `x += dx * steps`
- `y += dy * steps`
- `n -= steps`
- If `n >= steps`, `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6`

#### Iteration 2:
- `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`
- `x += dx * steps`
- `y += dy * steps`
- `n -= steps`
- If `n >= steps`, `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6`

#### Iteration 3:
- `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`
- `x += dx * steps`
- `y += dy * steps`
- `n -= steps`
- If `n >= steps`, `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6`

### Final Output State:
- After 3 iterations, `x` and `y` will be updated as follows:
  - `x` = \(2 \times dx + 2 \times dx \times steps + dx \times steps = 4 \times dx + 3 \times dx \times steps\)
  - `y` = \(2 \times dy + 2 \times dy \times steps + dy \times steps = 4 \times dy + 3 \times dy \times steps\)

- `direction_index` will be updated as:
  - `direction_index = (direction_index + 3) % 6`

- `n` will be updated as:
  - `n = n - 3 \times steps`

If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps` after 3 iterations, the loop will exit. Otherwise, it will not execute the return statement and will continue with the next iteration, but since we are only interested in the state after 3 iterations, we can assume `n` is still greater than 0 and has been decremented by `3 \times steps`.

### Summary:
- `x = 4 \times dx + 3 \times dx \times steps`
- `y = 4 \times dy + 3 \times dy \times steps`
- `direction_index = (direction_index + 3) \% 6`
- `n = n - 3 \times steps`

### Output State:
Output State: **x = 4 \* dx + 3 \* dx \* steps, y = 4 \* dy + 3 \* dy \* steps, direction_index = (direction_index + 3) \% 6, n = n - 3 \* steps**
