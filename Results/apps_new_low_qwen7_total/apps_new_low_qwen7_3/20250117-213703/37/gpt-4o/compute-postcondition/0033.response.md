Output State: **n is 1, x and y are updated, direction_index is updated to (direction_index + 1) % 6**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated, and `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.
- The first line assigns the values from `directions[direction_index]` to `dx` and `dy`. Since `direction_index` is initially unknown but will be updated later, we keep it in this form.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to its current value. Given `steps` is not defined, we assume it's a positive integer. Since `n` is 2 and `n -= steps`, `n` becomes 1 after this line.
- The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to its current value. Again, `steps` is assumed to be a positive integer.
- The fourth line decrements `n` by `steps`, making `n` equal to 1.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.

Given these changes, the final state is `n` is 1, `x` and `y` are updated, and `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.
