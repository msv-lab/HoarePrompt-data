To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions:

- The condition for the loop to continue executing is `n > 0`.
- Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `steps` is 1, and `direction_index` is 0.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `n > 0` must be true. Given that `n` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the only way this condition can be true is if `n` is strictly greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
