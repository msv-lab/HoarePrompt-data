Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 2 minus steps, x is updated by adding 2 * dx * steps to its original value, y is updated by adding 2 * dy * steps to its original value, direction_index is updated to ((direction_index + 3) % 6), dx is updated to the x-component of the new direction, dy is updated to the y-component of the new direction**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the direction tuple corresponding to `direction_index` into `dx` and `dy`.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to its original value.
- The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to its original value.
- The fourth line decreases `n` by `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to `((direction_index + 1) % 6)`, which is equivalent to `((direction_index + 3) % 6)` based on the initial condition that `direction_index` is incremented by 2 before this line.

These changes reflect the effects of executing the entire block of code.
