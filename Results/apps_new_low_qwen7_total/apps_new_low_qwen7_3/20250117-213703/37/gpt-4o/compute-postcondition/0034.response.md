Initial State: `n` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated, `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`

Code Block:
```
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Let's break down the code execution:

1. `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]`: This line assigns the values from the `directions` list at the index `direction_index` to `dx` and `dy`. The exact values of `dx` and `dy` depend on the `directions` list, but we don't need their specific values to determine the final state of `x` and `y`.

2. `x += dx * n`: This line updates `x` by adding `dx * n` to its current value. Given that `n` is 2, `x` will be updated by `2 * dx`.

3. `y += dy * n`: This line updates `y` by adding `dy * n` to its current value. Given that `n` is 2, `y` will be updated by `2 * dy`.

Since we do not know the specific values of `dx` and `dy` from the `directions` list, we cannot provide exact numerical values for `x` and `y`. However, we can express the changes in terms of `dx` and `dy`:

- `x` will be updated by `2 * dx`.
- `y` will be updated by `2 * dy`.

No other variables are affected by this code block.

Output State: **n is 2, x is updated by 2 * dx, y is updated by 2 * dy**
