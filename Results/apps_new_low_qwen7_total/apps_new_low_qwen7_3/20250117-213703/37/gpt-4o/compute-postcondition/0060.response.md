The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^18.

- **Case_1:** The program returns `x` and `y`, where `x` is `x_init + dx * n` and `y` is `y_init + dy * n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than `steps`.
- **Case_2:** `x` is updated by adding 2 * `dx` * `steps` and `dx` * `n` to its original value, `y` is updated by adding 2 * `dy` * `steps` and `dy` * `n` to its original value, and the program returns `x, y`. The `direction_index` is updated to (`direction_index` + 2) % 6.
- **Case_3:** `x` is updated by adding `dx * n` to its current value, `y` is updated by adding `dy * n` to its current value, and the program returns `x, y`.
- **Case_4:** `x` is updated by adding `dx * n`, `y` is updated by adding `dy * n`, and the program returns these updated values, while `direction_index` and `steps` remain unchanged.
- **Case_5:** The program returns the new coordinates `(x, y)` where `x` is updated by adding `dx` to the previous value of `x`, and `y` is updated by adding `dy` to the previous value of `y`. The `direction_index` is updated to (`direction_index` + 1) % 6.
- **Case_6:** The program returns `x` which is 2 * `dx` and `y` which is 2 * `dy`.
- **Case_7:** `x` is updated by 2 * `dx` + `dx` * `n`, `y` is updated by 2 * `dy` + `dy` * `n`, `direction_index` is (`direction_index` + 2) % 6, `steps` is incremented by 1, and the program returns `(x, y)`.
- **Case_8:** `x` is 2 * `dx` + 2 * `dx` * `steps` + 2 * `dx` + 2 * `dx` * (2 * `steps`) + `dx` * (n - 3 * `steps`), `y` is 2 * `dy` + 2 * `dy` * `steps` + 2 * `dy` + 2 * `dy` * (2 * `steps`) + `dy` * (n - 3 * `steps`).
- **Case_9:** The program returns `x` that is 11 and `y` that is `n` - 6.
- **Case_10:** The program returns `x` and `y`, where `x` is the sum of `dx_i * i` for `i` from 1 to `k`, plus `dx_{k+1} * (n mod steps)`, and `y` is the sum of `dy_i * i` for `i` from 1 to `k`, plus `dy_{k+1} * (n mod steps)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return coordinates or values based on specific conditions involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `direction_index`, `steps`, and other variables as described above.
