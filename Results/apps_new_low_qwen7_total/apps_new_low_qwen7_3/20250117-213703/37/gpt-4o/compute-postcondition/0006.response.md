Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is less than `steps`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `directions` is a list of tuples, and `direction_index` is an index within the range of `directions`.

Code Snippet:
```
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Analysis:
1. The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`. This does not change the values of `x` and `y` directly but prepares `dx` and `dy` for the next operation.
2. The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * n` to its current value.
3. The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * n` to its current value.

Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only express the final values in terms of their initial values plus the adjustments made by the code. Let's denote the initial values of `x` and `y` as `x_init` and `y_init`, respectively.

Final State Calculation:
- `x` becomes `x_init + dx * n`
- `y` becomes `y_init + dy * n`

Output State: **x is x_init + dx * n, y is y_init + dy * n, n is greater than or equal to 2, and n is less than steps, direction_index is an index within the range of directions, directions is a list of tuples**
