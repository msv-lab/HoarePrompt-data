Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is updated by adding `dx * steps` to its original value or `dx * n` to its current value, `y` is updated by adding `dy * steps` to its original value or `dy * n` to its current value, `direction_index` is updated to the next direction index in the directions list. If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged; otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are updated to the new direction components.**
