Postcondition: ***`x` is \(4 \times dx + 7 \times dx \times steps + dx \times steps\) and `y` is \(4 \times dy + 7 \times dy \times steps + dy \times steps\). `direction_index` is \(((direction_index + 1) \% 6)\). `n` is \(n - 6 \times steps - steps\), if `n >= steps`. Otherwise, `x` is 11 and `y` is `n - 6`***
