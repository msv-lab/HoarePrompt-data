Initial State: `n` is 1, `x` is updated by `dx * steps`, `y` is updated by `dy * steps`, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`

Code Block:
```python
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Analysis:
1. The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` assigns the values of the current direction (as defined in `directions`) to `dx` and `dy`. This means `dx` and `dy` take the x and y components of the current direction respectively.
2. The line `x += dx * n` updates the value of `x` by adding `dx * n` to it. Given that `n` is 1, this simplifies to `x += dx`.
3. The line `y += dy * n` updates the value of `y` by adding `dy * n` to it. Given that `n` is 1, this simplifies to `y += dy`.

Since `direction_index` is incremented by 1 and then taken modulo 6, it cycles through the indices of the `directions` list, ensuring that the direction changes over successive iterations.

Final Output State: **direction_index is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`, dx is the x-component of the new direction, dy is the y-component of the new direction, x is updated by adding `dx` to its previous value, y is updated by adding `dy` to its previous value**
