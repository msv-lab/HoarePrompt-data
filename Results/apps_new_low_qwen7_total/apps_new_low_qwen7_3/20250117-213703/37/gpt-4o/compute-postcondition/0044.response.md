Initial State: `x` is updated by 2 * `dx`, `y` is updated by 2 * `dy`, `direction_index` is (`direction_index` + 2) % 6, `steps` is incremented by 1, and `n` is less than or equal to `steps`

Code Block:
```
dx, dy = directions[direction_index]
x += dx * n
y += dy * n
```

Analysis:
1. The first line assigns the values of `dx` and `dy` from the list `directions` at the index specified by `direction_index`.
2. The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * n` to it.
3. The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * n` to it.

Since `n` is less than or equal to `steps`, the value of `n` is used in the updates of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **x is updated by 2 * dx + dx * n, y is updated by 2 * dy + dy * n, direction_index is (direction_index + 2) % 6, steps is incremented by 1, n is less than or equal to steps**
