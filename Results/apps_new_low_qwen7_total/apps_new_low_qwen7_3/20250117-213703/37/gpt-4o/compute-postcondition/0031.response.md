Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer initially set to 1. After the execution, if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, then `x` is updated by `dx * steps` added to the original `x`, `y` is updated by `dy * steps` added to the original `y`, and `direction_index` is updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`. Otherwise, `x` is updated by adding `dx` to the previous value of `x`, and `y` is updated by adding `dy` to the previous value of `y`. The `direction_index` is also updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.***
