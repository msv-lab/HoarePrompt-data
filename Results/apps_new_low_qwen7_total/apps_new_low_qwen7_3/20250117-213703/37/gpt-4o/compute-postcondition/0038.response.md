`steps` is incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `direction_index` remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated by 2 * `dx`, `y` is updated by 2 * `dy`, `direction_index` is (`direction_index` + 2) % 6, `steps` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is updated by 2 * `dx`, `y` is updated by 2 * `dy`, `direction_index` is (`direction_index` + 2) % 6, `steps` is incremented by 1.**
