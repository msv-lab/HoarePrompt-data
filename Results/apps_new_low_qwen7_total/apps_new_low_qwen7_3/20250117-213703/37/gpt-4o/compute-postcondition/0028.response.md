Output State: **n is 0, x is dx * steps added to the original x, y is dy * steps added to the original y, direction_index is (direction_index + 1) % 6**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is 1.
- The line `dx, dy = directions[direction_index]` fetches the values of `dx` and `dy` based on the current `direction_index`.
- The line `x += dx * steps` updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to its current value. Since `dx` is fetched from the `directions` list, we can say `x` is now `original_x + dx * steps`.
- Similarly, the line `y += dy * steps` updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to its current value. So, `y` is now `original_y + dy * steps`.
- The line `n -= steps` decreases `n` by `steps`. Since `n` was initially 1 and `steps` is typically 1, `n` becomes 0.
- The line `direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 6` updates `direction_index` to the next value in the list, ensuring it stays within the range of 0 to 5. 

Note: The exact values of `dx`, `dy`, `original_x`, and `original_y` depend on the `directions` list, which is not provided, so we leave them in a general form.
