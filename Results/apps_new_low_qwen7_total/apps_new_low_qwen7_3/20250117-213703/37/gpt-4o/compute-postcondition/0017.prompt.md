You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` is updated by adding `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dx * n` to its original value.
- `y` is updated by adding `2 * dy * steps` and `2 * dy * n` to its original value.
- `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `dx` is updated to the x-component of the new direction, and `dy` is updated to the y-component of the new direction. Otherwise, the function returns the updated values of `x` and `y`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for 2 iterations. Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, it means we are currently at the first iteration.

2. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**: The only variable explicitly involved in the loop head is `_`, but since it's just a placeholder, we focus on the other variables: `n`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `direction_index`.

3. **Updating States**:
   - `n` is initially an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `x` and `y` are updated based on `dx`, `dy`, `steps`, and `n`.
   - `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.

4. **Checking the Condition**: If `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`, `dx` and `dy` are updated to the x-component and y-component of the new direction, respectively.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since we are at the start of the next iteration (the second iteration), we need to consider the condition and updates from the first iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `n` will still be greater than or equal to 2 (since it started as such).
   - `x` and `y` will be updated based on the current `dx`, `dy`, `steps`, and `n`.
   - `direction_index` will be updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.
   - If `n` was greater than or equal to `steps` before the update, it might still be greater than or equal to `steps` after the update, but if not, the function would return the updated values of `x` and `y`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` and `y` are updated based on the current `dx`, `dy`, `steps`, and `n`.
- `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.
- If `n` was greater than or equal to `steps`, `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged; otherwise, they would have been updated to the new direction components.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` is updated by adding `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dx * n` to its original value.
- `y` is updated by adding `2 * dy * steps` and `2 * dy * n` to its original value.
- `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is updated by adding `2 * dx * steps` and `2 * dx * n` to its original value, `y` is updated by adding `2 * dy * steps` and `2 * dy * n` to its original value, `direction_index` is updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`**.
Program Fragment:
```
if n >= steps:
else:

```
if part: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 minus the number of steps executed, x is updated by adding dx * steps to its original value, y is updated by adding dy * steps to its original value, direction_index is updated to the next direction index in the directions list
else part: `The program returns x which is updated by adding dx * n to its current value, and y which is updated by adding dy * n to its current value`

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
