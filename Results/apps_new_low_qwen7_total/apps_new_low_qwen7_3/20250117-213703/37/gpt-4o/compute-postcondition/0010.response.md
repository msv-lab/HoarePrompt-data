Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 2, n is greater than or equal to steps - 1, x is updated by adding 2 * dx * steps to its original value and also adding dx * n to its original value, y is updated by adding 2 * dy * steps to its original value and also adding dy * n to its original value, direction_index is updated to ((direction_index + 2) % 6)**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`.
- The second line updates `x` by first adding `2 * dx * steps` to its original value and then adding `dx * n` to the result.
- The third line updates `y` by first adding `2 * dy * steps` to its original value and then adding `dy * n` to the result.
- The fourth line updates `direction_index` to `((direction_index + 2) % 6)`.

Note: The exact values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `direction_index` depend on their initial states, but the relationships and conditions described above hold true.
