The given code initializes several variables and sets up a list of directions but does not perform any operations that change the values of these variables or introduce new ones. Let's break it down:

1. `directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]`: This line creates a list of tuples representing possible directions (right, up-right, up, up-left, left, down-left) in a coordinate system.

2. `x, y = 0, 0`: These lines initialize the starting coordinates `(x, y)` to `(0, 0)`.

3. `steps = 1`: This line sets the number of steps to `1`.

4. `direction_index = 0`: This line sets the index of the current direction in the `directions` list to `0`.

Given that no operations modify the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `steps`, or `direction_index`, and since the precondition states that `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), this value remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, x is 0, y is 0, steps is 1, direction_index is 0**
