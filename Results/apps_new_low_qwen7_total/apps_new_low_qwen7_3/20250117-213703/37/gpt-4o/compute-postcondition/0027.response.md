Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(2)`. This means the loop will execute twice. The loop variables used here are implicit and do not require explicit names.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `x` is updated by `dx * steps`.
   - `y` is updated by `dy * steps`.
   - `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - Since the loop is specified as `for _ in range(2)`, it will run exactly two times.
   - We need to determine the state after the second iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute once more, which means the loop counter will be 2.
   - `n` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value (0) to 1.
   - The variables `x`, `y`, and `direction_index` will be updated according to their update rules:
     - `x` will be updated to `dx * steps`.
     - `y` will be updated to `dy * steps`.
     - `direction_index` will be updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.

5. **Finalize the state**:
   - `n` will be 1 after the second iteration.
   - `x` will be updated to `dx * steps`.
   - `y` will be updated to `dy * steps`.
   - `direction_index` will be updated to `(direction_index + 1) % 6`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is 1, `x` is updated by `dx * steps`, `y` is updated by `dy * steps`, `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`**
