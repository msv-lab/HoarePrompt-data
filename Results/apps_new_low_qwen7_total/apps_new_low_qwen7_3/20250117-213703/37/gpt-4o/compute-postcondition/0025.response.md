Output State: **n is greater than 0 and less than steps, x is updated by adding dx * n, y is updated by adding dy * n, direction_index is unchanged, steps is unchanged**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks the tuple `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`, which represent the change in the x and y coordinates, respectively.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * n` to its current value, where `n` is greater than 0 and less than `steps`.
- The second line also updates `y` by adding `dy * n` to its current value.
- The variables `direction_index` and `steps` are not affected by the executed lines.
