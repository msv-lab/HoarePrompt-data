Let's analyze the provided code block step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State:
- `x` is `2 * dx + dx * steps`
- `y` is `2 * dy + dy * steps`
- `direction_index` is `(direction_index + 1) % 6`
- `n` is `n - steps` and is still greater than 0

### Code Block:
```python
for _ in range(2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (`range(2)`), meaning it will run exactly twice.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations, we need to determine the state after each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### First Iteration:
- **x**: Updated to `2 * dx + dx * (steps + steps) = 2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps`
- **y**: Updated to `2 * dy + dy * (steps + steps) = 2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps`
- **direction_index**: Updated to `((direction_index + 1) % 6 + 1) % 6 = ((direction_index + 2) % 6)`
- **n**: Decrement by `steps`, so `n` becomes `n - steps - steps = n - 2 * steps`
- **n must still be greater than 0**: After the first iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.

#### Second Iteration:
- **x**: Updated to `2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (steps + steps) = 2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps)`
- **y**: Updated to `2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (steps + steps) = 2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps)`
- **direction_index**: Updated to `((direction_index + 2) % 6 + 1) % 6 = ((direction_index + 3) % 6)`
- **n**: Decrement by `steps`, so `n` becomes `n - 2 * steps - steps = n - 3 * steps`
- **n must still be greater than 0**: After the second iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final Output State:
- `x` is `2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps)`
- `y` is `2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps)`
- `direction_index` is `((direction_index + 3) % 6)`
- `n` is `n - 3 * steps` and is still greater than 0

**Output State:**
- `x` is `2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps)`
- `y` is `2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps)`
- `direction_index` is `((direction_index + 3) % 6)`
- `n` is `n - 3 * steps` and is still greater than 0

State: **`x` is `2 * dx + 2 * dx * steps + 2 * dx + 2 * dx * (2 * steps)`, `y` is `2 * dy + 2 * dy * steps + 2 * dy + 2 * dy * (2 * steps)`, `direction_index` is `((direction_index + 3) % 6)`, `n` is `n - 3 * steps` and is still greater than 0**
