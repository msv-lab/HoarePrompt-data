Output State: **`n` is less than `steps`, `x` is updated by adding `dx * k` to its original value where `k` is the sum of all steps taken until `n` is less than `steps`, `y` is updated by adding `dy * k` to its original value where `k` is the sum of all steps taken until `n` is less than `steps`, `direction_index` is updated to the final direction index in the directions list based on the total number of steps taken.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for up to 2 times, but it can run fewer times depending on the value of `n` and `steps`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps`. If true, it updates `x` and `y` by moving `steps` units in the current direction and then updates `n` and `direction_index`.
- If `n` is less than `steps` before the loop starts or after the first iteration, the loop does not run again and the function returns the updated values of `x` and `y`.
- The direction changes every time the loop runs, so `direction_index` will be updated accordingly.
- `dx` and `dy` are updated to the new direction components only if `n` is greater than or equal to `steps` at the start of an iteration.
- After the loop finishes, `n` will be less than `steps`, and `x` and `y` will have been updated based on the steps taken and the directions followed.
