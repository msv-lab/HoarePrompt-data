Output State: **x is \(4 \times dx + 7 \times dx \times steps + dx \times steps\), y is \(4 \times dy + 7 \times dy \times steps + dy \times steps\), direction_index is \(((direction_index + 1) \% 6)\), n is \(n - 6 \times steps - steps\)**

Explanation:
- The first line unpacks `directions[direction_index]` into `dx` and `dy`.
- The second line updates `x` by adding `dx * steps` to its current value.
- The third line updates `y` by adding `dy * steps` to its current value.
- The fourth line decreases `n` by `steps`.
- The fifth line updates `direction_index` to \(((direction_index + 1) \% 6)\).

Combining these changes:
- The initial value of `x` is \(4 \times dx + 7 \times dx \times steps\). After the second line, `x` becomes \(4 \times dx + 7 \times dx \times steps + dx \times steps\).
- The initial value of `y` is \(4 \times dy + 7 \times dy \times steps\). After the third line, `y` becomes \(4 \times dy + 7 \times dy \times steps + dy \times steps\).
- `direction_index` is updated to \(((direction_index + 1) \% 6)\).
- The initial value of `n` is \(n - 6 \times steps\). After the fourth line, `n` becomes \(n - 6 \times steps - steps\).
