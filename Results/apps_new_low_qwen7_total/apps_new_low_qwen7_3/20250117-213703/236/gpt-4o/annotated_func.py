#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and can_vasya_eat_half is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with a given value of k.
def func_1(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left` and `right` are equal, and `can_vasya_eat_half(left)` returns `True`.
    return left
    #The program returns the value of left, which is equal to right
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the initial amount of candies in the box. It uses binary search to find the largest integer `k` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True`. The function returns `k`, which is the maximum value satisfying the condition. The binary search ensures that `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` but `can_vasya_eat_half(k+1)` returns `False`. The function handles the case where `n` is 1, returning 1 directly since `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` will always return `True` if defined appropriately. If `can_vasya_eat_half` is never `True` for any value up to `n`, the function returns `n` itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and k is an integer representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. The function checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies given the value of k.
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n

vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        
        total -= total // 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: total = 0, vasya_eaten = sum of candies eaten by Vasya, n = initial number of candies such that no more candies can be eaten.
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n
    #`The program returns True if vasya_eaten multiplied by 2 is greater than or equal to n, otherwise False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. It calculates the total number of candies Vasya can eat before the remaining candies are less than `k` or until all candies are eaten. During this process, the function also simulates Vasya eating a fraction of the total candies (10%) every day, which reduces the total candies available. If the total candies eaten by Vasya, when doubled, is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
