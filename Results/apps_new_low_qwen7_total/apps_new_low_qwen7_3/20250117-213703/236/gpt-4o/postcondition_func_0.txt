The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the initial amount of candies in the box. It uses binary search to find the largest integer `k` such that `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True`. The function returns `k`, which is the maximum value satisfying the condition. The binary search ensures that `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` returns `True` but `can_vasya_eat_half(k+1)` returns `False`. The function handles the case where `n` is 1, returning 1 directly since `can_vasya_eat_half(1)` will always return `True` if defined appropriately. If `can_vasya_eat_half` is never `True` for any value up to `n`, the function returns `n` itself.
