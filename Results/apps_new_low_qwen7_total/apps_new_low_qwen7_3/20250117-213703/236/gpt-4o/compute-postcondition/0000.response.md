Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, and `k` is an integer representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. The function checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies given the value of `k`.

Code Block:
```
total = n
vasya_eaten = 0
```

Analysis:
- The first line initializes `total` to the value of `n`.
- The second line initializes `vasya_eaten` to 0.

No further operations are performed on these variables within the provided code block. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `total` and `vasya_eaten` are initialized as specified.

Output State: **n is an integer representing the initial amount of candies in the box, k is an integer representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day, total is n, vasya_eaten is 0**
