Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `total` is less than `k`.

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += total
total = 0
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += total` adds the current value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`. Since the initial value of `total` is less than `k`, let's denote it as `t` where `t < k`. After this line, `vasya_eaten` will have the value of `vasya_eaten + t`.
2. The second line `total = 0` sets the value of `total` to 0, effectively resetting it.

Final State:
- `vasya_eaten` is increased by the initial value of `total`.
- `total` is now 0.

Since we don't know the exact initial value of `vasya_eaten`, we can only express it in terms of the initial conditions. However, we know that `n > 0` and `total < k`.

Output State: **vasya_eaten is vasya_eaten + total (initial value), total is 0**
