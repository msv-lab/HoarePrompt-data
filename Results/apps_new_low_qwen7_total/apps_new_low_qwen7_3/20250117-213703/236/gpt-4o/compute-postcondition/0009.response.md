Output State: **total is 0, vasya_eaten is greater than 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `total` must be greater than 0.
- The first line adds the value of `total` to `vasya_eaten`, increasing `vasya_eaten` by `total`.
- The second line sets `total` to 0.
- After these operations, `total` is 0 and `vasya_eaten` is greater than 0 (since it was increased by a positive value).
