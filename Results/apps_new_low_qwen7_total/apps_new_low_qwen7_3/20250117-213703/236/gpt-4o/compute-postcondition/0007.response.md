`total` is decremented by its value divided by 10 (using integer division). The value of `total` is reduced by one-tenth of itself. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is decreased by total // 10, `vasya_eaten` is either updated to `vasya_eaten + total` and `total` is set to 0 if `total` was less than `k`, otherwise `vasya_eaten` is set to `k` and `total` is set to `T - k`.**
