Initial State: `total` must be greater than 0

Code Snippet:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
- The first line adds the value of `k` to `vasya_eaten`.
- The second line subtracts the value of `k` from `total`.

Since `total` must be greater than 0 initially and we are subtracting `k` from it, the final value of `total` will depend on the initial value of `total` and the value of `k`. However, without knowing the exact values of `total` and `k`, we can express the final value of `total` as `total - k`. 

The value of `vasya_eaten` will be increased by `k`.

Output State: **total is total - k, vasya_eaten is vasya_eaten + k**
