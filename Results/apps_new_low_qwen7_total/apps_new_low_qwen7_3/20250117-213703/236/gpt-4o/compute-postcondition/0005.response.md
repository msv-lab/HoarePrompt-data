Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, and `total` is greater than or equal to `k`

Code Block:
```
vasya_eaten += k
total -= k
```

Analysis:
- The first line `vasya_eaten += k` adds the value of `k` to `vasya_eaten`. Since `vasya_eaten` is not defined initially, it will be considered as 0 before this operation.
- The second line `total -= k` subtracts the value of `k` from `total`.

Given that the initial state includes `n > 0` and `total >= k`, let's denote the initial value of `total` as `T` where `T >= k`.

After executing the code block:
- `vasya_eaten` becomes `0 + k = k`.
- `total` becomes `T - k`.

Output State: **vasya_eaten is k, total is T - k**
