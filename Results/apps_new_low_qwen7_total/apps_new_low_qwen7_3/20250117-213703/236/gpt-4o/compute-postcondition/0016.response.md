Postcondition: **`total` is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the integer division of itself by 10. `vasya_eaten` is greater than 0 if `total` was less than `k` before the operation, otherwise `vasya_eaten` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the conditions and changes in `total` and `vasya_eaten` are covered comprehensively.
