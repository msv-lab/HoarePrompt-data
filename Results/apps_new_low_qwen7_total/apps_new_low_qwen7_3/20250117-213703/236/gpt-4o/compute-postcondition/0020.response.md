The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts a parameter `k`. `k` is an integer representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. The function checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies given the value of `k`. 

If `vasya_eaten` (which is `k`) multiplied by 2 is greater than or equal to `n` (the initial amount of candies), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_vasya_eat_half` is to accept an integer `k` and return `True` if `k * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise return `False`.
