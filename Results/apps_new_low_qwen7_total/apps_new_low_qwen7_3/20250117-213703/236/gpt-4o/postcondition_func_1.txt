The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. It calculates the total number of candies Vasya can eat before the remaining candies are less than `k` or until all candies are eaten. During this process, the function also simulates Vasya eating a fraction of the total candies (10%) every day, which reduces the total candies available. If the total candies eaten by Vasya, when doubled, is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
