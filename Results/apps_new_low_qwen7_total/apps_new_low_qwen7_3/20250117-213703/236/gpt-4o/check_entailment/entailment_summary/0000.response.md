Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum value of \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies initially in the box.
2. The solution uses binary search to efficiently find this value.
3. The `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies according to the problem statement and checks if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.
4. The `func_1(n)` function performs a binary search to find the smallest \( k \) that satisfies the condition checked by `can_vasya_eat_half`.

Let's verify each part:

### Binary Search (`func_1`):
- The binary search correctly narrows down the range `[1, n]` to find the smallest \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.
- The function stops when `left` equals `right`, indicating that `k = left` is the correct answer.

### Condition Check (`can_vasya_eat_half`):
- The function accurately simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies:
  - Vasya eats \( k \) candies each day until the remaining candies are less than \( k \).
  - Petya eats 10% of the remaining candies each day (rounded down).
- The function correctly returns whether Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.

Given the problem requirements and the provided function behaviors, the implementation should work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
