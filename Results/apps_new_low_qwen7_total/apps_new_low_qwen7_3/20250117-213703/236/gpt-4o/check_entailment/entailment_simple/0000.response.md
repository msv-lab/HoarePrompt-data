Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding the smallest integer \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies he initially has, considering the interaction with Petya who takes 10% of the remaining candies each day.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The code uses a binary search approach to find the minimum \( k \). This is efficient because it reduces the search space exponentially by halving the range in each iteration. 

3. **Function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)`**:
   - It simulates the process of Vasya and Petya taking candies over multiple days.
   - It correctly updates the total candies eaten by Vasya (`vasya_eaten`) and the remaining candies in the box (`total`).
   - It handles the case where the number of candies is not divisible by 10 by using integer division (`total // 10`).

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` performs a binary search between 1 and \( n \).
   - It uses the helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` to check if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies with a given \( k \).
   - The binary search narrows down the correct \( k \) by adjusting the bounds based on whether Vasya can meet the condition or not.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The binary search correctly handles the case when the initial number of candies is very small or large.
   - The `can_vasya_eat_half(k)` function correctly accounts for Petya's consumption, even when the number of candies is less than 10.

6. **Output**:
   - The final value returned by `func_1(n)` is the smallest \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.

Given this analysis, the code logic appears to be sound and should work as intended for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
