You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach to find the minimum value of \( k \) that allows Vasya to eat at least half of the candies. However, there are issues with the implementation of the `can_vasya_eat_half` function.

In the `can_vasya_eat_half` function, the line `total -= total // 10` is used to simulate Petya's action of eating 10% of the remaining candies. However, this operation does not correctly handle the case where the number of candies is not divisible by 10. Specifically, it should round down to the nearest whole number, which is not being done properly.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:

- Initial candies: \( n = 97 \)
- Suppose \( k = 10 \)

The sequence of candy counts would be:

1. Vasya eats 10 candies: \( 97 - 10 = 87 \)
2. Petya eats 8 candies (since \( 87 \div 10 = 8 \) with remainder 7): \( 87 - 8 = 79 \)
3. Vasya eats 10 candies: \( 79 - 10 = 69 \)
4. Petya eats 6 candies (since \( 69 \div 10 = 6 \) with remainder 9): \( 69 - 6 = 63 \)
5. Continue this process...

However, the current implementation of `can_vasya_eat_half` does not handle the rounding down correctly, leading to incorrect results. This can be seen in the example provided in the problem statement, where the output is incorrect.

For instance, in the given example with \( n = 68 \), the correct minimal \( k \) should be 3, but the program might return a different value due to the incorrect handling of Petya's actions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate Petya's action of eating 10% of the remaining candies, especially when the number of candies is not divisible by 10.
