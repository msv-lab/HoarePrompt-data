Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the minimum integer \( k \) such that Vasya can eat at least half of the candies.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, narrowing down the possible values of \( k \) using a `while` loop.
   - The function `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` is used to check if Vasya can achieve the goal with a given \( k \). If `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`, the upper bound is adjusted; otherwise, the lower bound is adjusted.

2. **Validation Function (`can_vasya_eat_half`)**:
   - This function accurately simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
   - It correctly accounts for Petya eating 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down).
   - The function checks if the total candies eaten by Vasya is at least half of the initial amount of candies \( n \).
   - The logic for checking if Vasya can eat at least half of the candies is correct and consistent with the problem statement.

Given the detailed explanation of both functions and their correctness in aligning with the problem statement, we can conclude that the overall implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
