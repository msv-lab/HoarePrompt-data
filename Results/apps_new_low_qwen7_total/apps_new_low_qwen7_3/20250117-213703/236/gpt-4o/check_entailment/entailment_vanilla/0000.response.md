### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic within `func_1` and `can_vasya_eat_half` functions aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the smallest integer \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.
   - Initial bounds are set as \( left = 1 \) and \( right = n \).

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left < right`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range.
   - The helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` checks if Vasya can eat at least half the candies with \( k = mid \).
   - If Vasya can eat enough candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`), then adjust `right = mid`.
   - Otherwise, increase the lower bound `left = mid + 1`.

3. **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
   - It simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
   - `total` represents the current number of candies in the box.
   - `vasya_eaten` keeps track of how many candies Vasya has eaten.
   - In each iteration, Vasya eats `k` candies.
   - Petya then eats 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down).
   - The process continues until there are no candies left.
   - If Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Verification:

- **Binary Search**: 
  - The binary search ensures that the value of \( k \) is minimized while satisfying the condition.
  - The search space is effectively narrowed down correctly using the binary search approach.

- **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
  - The function accurately simulates the consumption pattern described in the problem.
  - It correctly handles the rounding down when Petya eats candies.
  - It properly checks whether Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program should work correctly for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
