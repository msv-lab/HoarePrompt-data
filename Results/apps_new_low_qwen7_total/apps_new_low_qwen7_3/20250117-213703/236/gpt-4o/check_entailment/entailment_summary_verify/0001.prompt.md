You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):

    (left, right) = (1, n)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_vasya_eat_half(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

#Function 2:
def can_vasya_eat_half(k):
    total = n
    vasya_eaten = 0
    while total > 0:
        if total < k:
            vasya_eaten += total
            total = 0
        else:
            vasya_eaten += k
            total -= k
        total -= total // 10
    return vasya_eaten * 2 >= n



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `can_vasya_eat_half` accepts an integer `k` representing the number of candies Vasya eats each day. It calculates the total number of candies Vasya can eat before the remaining candies are less than `k` or until all candies are eaten. During this process, the function also simulates Vasya eating a fraction of the total candies (10%) every day, which reduces the total candies available. If the total candies eaten by Vasya, when doubled, is greater than or equal to the initial number of candies `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic within `func_1` and `can_vasya_eat_half` functions aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the smallest integer \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.
   - Initial bounds are set as \( left = 1 \) and \( right = n \).

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left < right`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range.
   - The helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` checks if Vasya can eat at least half the candies with \( k = mid \).
   - If Vasya can eat enough candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`), then adjust `right = mid`.
   - Otherwise, increase the lower bound `left = mid + 1`.

3. **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
   - It simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
   - `total` represents the current number of candies in the box.
   - `vasya_eaten` keeps track of how many candies Vasya has eaten.
   - In each iteration, Vasya eats `k` candies.
   - Petya then eats 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down).
   - The process continues until there are no candies left.
   - If Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Verification:

- **Binary Search**: 
  - The binary search ensures that the value of \( k \) is minimized while satisfying the condition.
  - The search space is effectively narrowed down correctly using the binary search approach.

- **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
  - The function accurately simulates the consumption pattern described in the problem.
  - It correctly handles the rounding down when Petya eats candies.
  - It properly checks whether Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program should work correctly for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
