### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the binary search with `left = 1` and `right = n`. This is correct because Vasya can eat as few as 1 candy per day and as many as \( n \) candies per day (although eating \( n \) candies per day would result in Vasya eating fewer than half the candies in most cases).

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left < right`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range.
   - The helper function `can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` checks if Vasya can eat at least half the candies with \( k = mid \).
   - If Vasya can eat enough candies (`can_vasya_eat_half(mid)` returns `True`), then adjust `right = mid`.
   - Otherwise, increase the lower bound `left = mid + 1`.

3. **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
   - It simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
   - `total` represents the current number of candies in the box.
   - `vasya_eaten` keeps track of how many candies Vasya has eaten.
   - In each iteration, Vasya eats `k` candies.
   - Petya then eats 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down).
   - The process continues until there are no candies left.
   - If Vasya has eaten at least half of the initial candies, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### State Analysis:
- **Before `func_1` Call**:
  - `n` is the initial number of candies.
  - `can_vasya_eat_half` is a function that checks if Vasya can eat at least half the candies with a given \( k \).

- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - Binary search narrows down the value of \( k \) until `left` equals `right`.
  - When the loop exits, `can_vasya_eat_half(right)` returns `True`, ensuring Vasya can eat at least half the candies with \( k = right \).

- **Inside `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
  - Simulates Vasya and Petya's actions iteratively.
  - Ensures Vasya eats `k` candies each morning.
  - Petya eats 10% of the remaining candies (rounded down) each evening.
  - Checks if Vasya eats at least half the initial candies by comparing `vasya_eaten * 2` with `n`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Binary Search**:
  - The binary search approach is sound and efficiently narrows down the optimal \( k \).
  - The termination condition `left < right` ensures the search converges to the correct value.

- **Helper Function `can_vasya_eat_half`**:
  - Correctly simulates the process, including the rounding down of Petya's consumption.
  - Properly checks if Vasya eats at least half the candies.

Given the detailed analysis and the logical correctness of both functions, the provided program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds the minimal \( k \) such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

### Final:
Final: **True**
