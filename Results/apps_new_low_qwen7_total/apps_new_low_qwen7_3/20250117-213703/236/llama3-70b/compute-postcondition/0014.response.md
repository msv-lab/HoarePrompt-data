The only variable in the loop head is `True`, which means the loop will always continue to execute as long as it is true. Since there are no conditions within the loop head that can be adjusted, no changes are needed to the states of any variables.

However, to proceed to the next iteration of the loop, we can simply repeat the current state.

State: **`candies` is 0, `k` is 2, `vasya_eaten` is `n`, `petya_eaten` is 0**
