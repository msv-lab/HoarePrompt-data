`k` is incremented by 1. The values of `vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, and `candies` remain unchanged. The condition for `vasya_eaten` being greater than or equal to half of `n` does not change because `k` is the only variable that could affect it, and its value has been updated.

Output State: **`vasya_eaten` is the sum of all min(k, candies) values, `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies` is 0, `k` is increased by 1, and if vasya_eaten is currently greater than or equal to half of n, vasya_eaten remains the same.**
