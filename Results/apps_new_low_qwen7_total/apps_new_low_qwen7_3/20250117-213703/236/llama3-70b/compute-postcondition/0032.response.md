Output State: **candies is a positive integer reduced by min(k, candies) then further reduced by candies // 10, vasya_eaten is min(k, candies)**

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` adds the minimum value between `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.
2. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` subtracts the minimum value between `k` and `candies` from `candies`.
3. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to be the integer division of `candies` by 10.
4. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` subtracts the value of `petya_eaten` from `candies`.

After running these lines, `candies` is reduced by both `min(k, candies)` and `candies // 10`, and `vasya_eaten` is updated to include the value of `min(k, candies)`. The values of `k` and `petya_eaten` are not explicitly defined in the code, but they are used in the operations. The precondition ensures that `candies` starts as a positive integer, which remains true throughout the code execution.
