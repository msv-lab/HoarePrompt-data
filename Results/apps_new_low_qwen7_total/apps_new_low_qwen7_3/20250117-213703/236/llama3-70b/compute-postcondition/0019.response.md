Initial State: `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`, `candies` is 0

Code Execution:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
   - Since `candies` is 0, `min(k, candies)` is 0.
   - Therefore, `vasya_eaten += 0`, which means `vasya_eaten` remains unchanged.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`
   - Since `candies` is 0 and `min(k, candies)` is 0, `candies -= 0` means `candies` remains 0.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
   - Since `candies` is 0, `petya_eaten = 0 // 10` which is 0.
   - Therefore, `petya_eaten` becomes 0.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`
   - Since `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies -= 0` means `candies` remains 0.

Final Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, n), petya_eaten is 0, candies is 0**
