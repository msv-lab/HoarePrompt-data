Output State: **vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0, candies is n, k is increased by 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `candies = n` assigns the value of `n` (which is not defined in the initial state or the code) to `candies`. Since `n` is not specified, we keep it as `n`.
- The second line `vasya_eaten = 0` sets `vasya_eaten` to 0.
- The initial state of `petya_eaten` is 0, and this line does not change it.
- The initial state of `candies` is 0, and this line changes it to `n`.
- The initial state mentions that `k` is increased by 1, and this line does not modify `k` further, so `k` remains increased by 1 from its initial state.
