Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `candies > 0`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is `0`, and `candies` is `0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `candies > 0` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The only state that affects the loop condition is `candies`. For the loop to continue, `candies` must be greater than `0` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `candies` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute again.

**Final State**:
State: **`vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten` is `0`, and `candies` must be greater than `0`**
