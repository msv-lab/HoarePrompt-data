Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop condition is `candies > 0`.
   - The variables involved are `candies`, `k`, and `vasya_eaten`.

2. **Analyze the Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is 1.
   - `candies` is equal to `n`, so initially, `candies` is also within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `vasya_eaten` is 0.

3. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `candies > 0` must be true.

4. **Check the Current State:**
   - Since `candies` is equal to `n` and \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `candies` is already positive.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `candies` is initially set to a positive value (as it equals `n` and `n` is at least 1), the loop can certainly execute the first time without any modification to the state.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is 1, `candies` is `n`, `vasya_eaten` is 0**
