To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the code and the given output states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the Code and Initial State
- The initial state is given as `candies is n`, `k is 2`, `vasya_eaten is 0`, and `petya_eaten is 0`.
- The loop continues while `candies > 0`.

#### 2. Track Variable Changes
- **VASYA_EATEN**: Vasya eats `min(k, candies)` candies each time the loop runs.
- **CANDIES**: After Vasya eats, the remaining candies are `candies - min(k, candies)`.
- **PETYA_EATEN**: Petya then eats `candies // 10` candies, which reduces the remaining candies by `candies // 10`.
- **CANDIES**: Finally, the remaining candies after Petya's turn are `candies - candies // 10`.

#### 3. Summarize the Loop Behavior
- Each iteration of the loop decreases the candies by `min(k, candies) + candies // 10`.
- If candies are less than `k`, only the remaining candies will be eaten by Vasya and Petya.
- The loop stops when `candies` becomes zero or negative.

#### 4. Verify Relationships
- After the loop, `candies` should be zero since it continues to decrease until it reaches zero.
- `vasya_eaten` accumulates the total candies eaten by Vasya, which is the sum of `min(k, candies)` over all iterations.
- `petya_eaten` accumulates the total candies eaten by Petya, which is the sum of `candies // 10` over all iterations.

### Final Output State Calculation

Let's consider the general case where the loop runs until `candies` becomes zero.

- After each iteration, `candies` decreases by `min(k, candies) + candies // 10`.
- The loop will stop when `candies <= 0`.

To find the exact number of iterations, we need to understand how the value of `candies` changes over iterations. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact value of `n`, we can derive the general behavior.

For any positive integer `n`:
- In the first iteration, `candies` decreases by `min(2, n) + n // 10`.
- Subsequent iterations continue until `candies` becomes zero.

Given the pattern from the provided examples:
- After 1 iteration: `vasya_eaten = min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten = (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`, `candies = 0`.
- After 2 iterations: `vasya_eaten = min(k, n)`, `petya_eaten = 0`, `candies = 0`.

From this, we can infer that:
- `vasya_eaten` will be `min(k, n)`, because Vasya eats his share in the first iteration and no more candies are left.
- `petya_eaten` will be `0`, because there are no candies left for Petya to eat.
- `candies` will be `0` since the loop stops when there are no more candies.

### Final Output State
Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(2, n), petya_eaten is 0, candies is 0.**
