Output State: **candies is n, k is 2, vasya_eaten is 0, petya_eaten is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line updates the value of `candies` to `n`.
- The second line resets `vasya_eaten` to 0, but since `vasya_eaten` was originally `n`, it now becomes 0.
- The value of `k` and `petya_eaten` remain unchanged from their initial states.
