Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `candies > 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `candies` is `n`.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `vasya_eaten` is 0.
   - `petya_eaten` is 0.

3. **Determine what needs to be true for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `candies > 0` must be true.
   - Currently, `candies` is `n`.

4. **Check the requirement**:
   - Since `candies` is `n`, we need `n` to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No other variables (`k`, `vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`) affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be modified.
   - The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `candies` (which is `n`) is greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`candies` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**
