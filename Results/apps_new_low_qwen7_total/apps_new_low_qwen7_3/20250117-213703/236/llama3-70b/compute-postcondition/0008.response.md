Output State: **candies is less than or equal to the original value minus k if k is less than or equal to candies, vasya_eaten is the original value of candies if k is less than or equal to candies otherwise it is the original value of candies minus candies modulo k, petya_eaten is candies divided by 10 if candies is greater than 0, otherwise 0**

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` updates `vasya_eaten` to be the minimum of `k` and `candies`. If `k` is less than or equal to `candies`, `vasya_eaten` will increase by `k`; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.
2. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` decreases `candies` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`. If `k` is less than or equal to `candies`, `candies` will decrease by `k`; otherwise, it will decrease by `candies` itself.
3. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to be the integer division of `candies` by 10. This means `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10` if `candies` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is 0.
4. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` decreases `candies` by `petya_eaten`. Since `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10` (or 0 if `candies` is 0), this further reduces `candies`.

Given that `candies` must be greater than 0 initially, the final state depends on the values of `k` and `candies`:
- `candies` is reduced by `min(k, candies)`, then by `candies // 10`.
- `vasya_eaten` increases by `min(k, candies)`.
- `petya_eaten` is `candies // 10` if `candies` is greater than 0, otherwise 0.
