The code increments the value of `k` by 1. The initial state shows that `candies` is 0, `k` is 1, `vasya_eaten` is `n`, and `petya_eaten` is 0. The condition involving `vasya_eaten` does not change the states of the variables. Therefore, the value of `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`candies` is 0, `k` is 2, `vasya_eaten` is `n`, `petya_eaten` is 0**
