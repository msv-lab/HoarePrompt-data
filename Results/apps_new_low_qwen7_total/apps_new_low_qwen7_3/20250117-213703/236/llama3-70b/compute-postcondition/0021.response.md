Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, n + min(k, candies)), candies is candies - min(k, candies) - candies // 10, petya_eaten is candies // 10**

Explanation:
1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` increases `vasya_eaten` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
2. `candies -= min(k, candies)` decreases `candies` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to one-tenth of `candies` (integer division).
4. `candies -= petya_eaten` decreases `candies` by `petya_eaten`.

Given the initial state where `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, n)` and `petya_eaten` is `0`, and `candies` is greater than `0`:

- After the first line, `vasya_eaten` becomes `min(k, n) + min(k, candies)`.
- After the second line, `candies` becomes `candies - min(k, candies)`.
- After the third line, `petya_eaten` becomes `candies // 10`.
- After the fourth line, `candies` becomes `candies - candies // 10`.

The final state includes the updated values of `vasya_eaten`, `candies`, and `petya_eaten` based on the operations performed.
