To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop condition and the provided program state.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while candies > 0:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `candies` is greater than 0.

### Program State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `candies` is reduced by the minimum of `k` and itself.
- `vasya_eaten` is increased by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `petya_eaten` is the integer division of the remaining candies by 10.
- `candies` is further reduced by `petya_eaten`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Effect on Candies**: 
   - `candies` is first reduced by the minimum of `k` and itself.
   - Then, `candies` is further reduced by `petya_eaten`, where `petya_eaten` is the integer division of the remaining candies by 10.

### Adjusting States
- The only state that directly affects the loop condition (`candies > 0`) is `candies` itself.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `candies` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion
We need to adjust the state of `candies` to ensure it is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `candies` is reduced twice (first by the minimum of `k` and itself, then by `petya_eaten`), we need to ensure that even after these reductions, `candies` remains greater than 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`candies` must be greater than 0**
