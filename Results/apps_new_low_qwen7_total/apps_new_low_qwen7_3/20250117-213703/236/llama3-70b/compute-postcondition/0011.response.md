The code consists of two lines:

1. `print(k)`
2. `break`

Let's analyze the impact of these lines:

1. `print(k)`: This line prints the value of `k`, which is initially 1. After printing, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
2. `break`: This line is used to exit a loop or switch statement, but since there is no loop or switch in this code snippet, it does nothing and simply ends the execution of the current block.

Given the initial state:
- `candies` is 0
- `k` is 1
- `vasya_eaten` is `n`
- `petya_eaten` is 0
- `vasya_eaten * 2` is greater than or equal to `n`

After executing the code, the values of `candies`, `petya_eaten`, and the condition `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n` remain unchanged. Only `k` is printed, but its value does not change due to the `break` statement.

Output State: **candies is 0, k is 1, vasya_eaten is n, petya_eaten is 0, and vasya_eaten * 2 is greater than or equal to n**
