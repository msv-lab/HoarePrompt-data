Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is 1.
   - `candies` is \(n - 1 - \frac{n - 1}{10}\).
   - `vasya_eaten` is 1.
   - `petya_eaten` is \(\frac{n - 1}{10}\).

3. **Calculate the value of `candies`**:
   - Given \(candies = n - 1 - \frac{n - 1}{10}\),
   - Simplify the expression: \(candies = n - 1 - \frac{n - 1}{10} = \frac{10(n - 1) - (n - 1)}{10} = \frac{9(n - 1)}{10}\).

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{9(n - 1)}{10} > 0\).

5. **Determine the minimum value of \(n\)**:
   - Since \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the smallest value of \(n\) that satisfies \(\frac{9(n - 1)}{10} > 0\) is when \(n = 2\) (since \(\frac{9(2 - 1)}{10} = \frac{9}{10} > 0\)).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `candies`, so we need to ensure that `candies` is greater than 0.
   - Given that \(\frac{9(n - 1)}{10} > 0\), the smallest possible value for \(n\) is 2, which means \(candies\) should be positive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`candies` must be greater than 0**
