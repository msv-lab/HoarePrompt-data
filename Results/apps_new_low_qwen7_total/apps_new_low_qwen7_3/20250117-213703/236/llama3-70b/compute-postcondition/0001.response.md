Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `while True` loop runs indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.
2. Since the loop condition is always `True`, the loop will definitely execute at least once, regardless of the initial state of the variables.

Given this, no adjustments to the state of the variables `n` or `k` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will start executing immediately upon entering the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is 1**
