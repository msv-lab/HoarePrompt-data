Output State: **candies is less than or equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of k and candies, vasya_eaten is the original value of candies if candies is less than or equal to k, otherwise it is the minimum of k and candies, petya_eaten is candies divided by 10 if candies is greater than 0, otherwise it is 0** 

Explanation:
1. The first line `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)` increases `vasya_eaten` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`. This updates the value of `vasya_eaten`.
2. The second line `candies -= min(k, candies)` decreases `candies` by the minimum of `k` and `candies`. This updates the value of `candies`.
3. The third line `petya_eaten = candies // 10` sets `petya_eaten` to be the integer division of `candies` by 10. This updates the value of `petya_eaten`.
4. The fourth line `candies -= petya_eaten` decreases `candies` by `petya_eaten`. This further updates the value of `candies`.

Since the initial state requires `candies` to be greater than 0, the final value of `candies` will be less than or equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of `k` and `candies`, assuming `k` is at least `candies`. The values of `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` are also updated based on the operations performed.
