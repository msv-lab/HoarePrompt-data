Let's analyze the given code and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- **Initial State**: 
  - `vasya_eaten` = 0
  - `petya_eaten` = 0
  - `candies` = n
  - `k` is increased by 1 (though the value of `k` itself is not used in the loop)

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariants**: The value of `k` is not used in the loop, so it remains constant but irrelevant to the loop logic.
- **Variables Updated in the Loop**:
  - `vasya_eaten`: Increased by `min(k, candies)` each time the loop runs.
  - `candies`: Decreased by `min(k, candies)` initially and then further decreased by `petya_eaten`, where `petya_eaten = candies // 10`.
  - `petya_eaten`: Set to `candies // 10` each time the loop runs.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.
- Each iteration, `vasya_eaten` increases by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `candies` is then reduced by this amount and further reduced by `petya_eaten`, which is `candies // 10`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop will continue until `candies` becomes 0 or less.
- After each iteration, `candies` is reduced by `min(k, candies)` and then by `candies // 10`.

### Final State Calculation
To find the final state, consider the following:
- As the loop continues, `candies` keeps decreasing.
- Eventually, `candies` will become 0 or less, and the loop will stop.
- When `candies` is 0, the loop stops, and no further changes occur.

Let's denote the final value of `candies` as `C_f`. Since `candies` is reduced by `min(k, candies)` and then by `candies // 10`, eventually `candies` will reach 0 or a very small positive number (which doesn't affect the integer division).

The final state will be:
- `vasya_eaten` = sum of all `min(k, candies)` values over all iterations.
- `petya_eaten` = 0 (since once `candies` reaches 0, `petya_eaten` will no longer contribute).
- `candies` = 0 (as the loop stops when `candies` is 0 or less).

### Conclusion
Output State: **vasya_eaten is the sum of all min(k, candies) values, petya_eaten is 0, and candies is 0.**
