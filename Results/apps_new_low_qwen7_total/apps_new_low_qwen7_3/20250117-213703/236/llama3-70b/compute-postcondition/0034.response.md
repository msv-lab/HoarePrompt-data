Let's analyze the code block step by step:

### Initial State:
- `candies` is a positive integer reduced by `min(k, candies)`, then further reduced by `candies // 10`, and candies must be greater than 0.
- This means initially, `candies` is already in a state where it has been adjusted based on `k` and the integer division by 10.

### Code Block:
```python
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

#### Line 1:
- `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`
  - This line adds the minimum of `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`.
  - Let's denote the initial value of `candies` as `C`.

#### Line 2:
- `candies -= min(k, candies)`
  - This line subtracts the minimum of `k` and `candies` from `candies`.
  - After this operation, `candies` will be `C - min(k, C)`.

#### Line 3:
- `petya_eaten = candies // 10`
  - This line calculates the integer division of `candies` by 10 and assigns it to `petya_eaten`.
  - `petya_eaten` will be `(C - min(k, C)) // 10`.

#### Line 4:
- `candies -= petya_eaten`
  - This line subtracts `petya_eaten` from `candies`.
  - After this operation, `candies` will be `C - min(k, C) - (C - min(k, C)) // 10`.

### Final State Calculation:
- Let's assume `C` is the initial value of `candies`.
- After Line 2, `candies = C - min(k, C)`.
- After Line 3, `petya_eaten = (C - min(k, C)) // 10`.
- After Line 4, `candies = C - min(k, C) - (C - min(k, C)) // 10`.

### Final Output State:
- `vasya_eaten` is increased by `min(k, C)`.
- `candies` is updated to `C - min(k, C) - (C - min(k, C)) // 10`.
- `petya_eaten` is set to `(C - min(k, C)) // 10`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **vasya_eaten is vasya_eaten + min(k, candies), candies is C - min(k, C) - (C - min(k, C)) // 10, petya_eaten is (C - min(k, C)) // 10**
