Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `vasya_eaten`: 0
   - `petya_eaten`: 0
   - `candies`: `n`
   - `k`: Increased by 1 (though this variable is not directly relevant to the loop condition)

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `candies > 0`.

3. **Determine the Required State for the First Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `candies > 0` must be true. Given that `candies` is currently set to `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   Since `n` (the value of `candies`) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state of `candies` to ensure it meets this condition.

State: **`vasya_eaten` is 0, `petya_eaten` is 0, `candies` must be greater than 0**
