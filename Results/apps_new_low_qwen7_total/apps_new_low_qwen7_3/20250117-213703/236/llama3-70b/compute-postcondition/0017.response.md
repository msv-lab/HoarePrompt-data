Output State: **vasya_eaten is min(k, n), petya_eaten is (candies - min(k, candies)) // 10, candies is 0** 

Explanation: 
1. The first line increases `vasya_eaten` by the minimum value between `k` and `candies`. After this line, `vasya_eaten` equals `min(k, candies)`.
2. The second line decreases `candies` by the minimum value between `k` and `candies`. If `candies` is less than or equal to `k`, `candies` becomes 0. Otherwise, it is reduced by `min(k, candies)`.
3. The third line sets `petya_eaten` to one-tenth of the remaining `candies` after the first two lines. Since `candies` is now either 0 or reduced by `min(k, candies)`, `petya_eaten` will be `(candies - min(k, candies)) // 10`.
4. The fourth line further decreases `candies` by `petya_eaten`, which is either 0 or a tenth of the remaining `candies`. After this operation, `candies` will be 0 if it was non-zero before the third line.

Since `candies` is always decreased until it reaches 0, the final state of `candies` is 0. The values of `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` depend on the initial value of `candies` and `k`.
