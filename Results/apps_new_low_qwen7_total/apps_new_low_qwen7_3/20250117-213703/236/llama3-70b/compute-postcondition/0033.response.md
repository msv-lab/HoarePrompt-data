Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `candies > 0`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `candies` is a positive integer reduced by `min(k, candies)` then further reduced by `candies // 10`.
   - `vasya_eaten` is `min(k, candies)`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `candies` must be greater than 0.
   - After the loop body executes, `candies` is updated based on its current value and the values of `k` and `candies // 10`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `candies > 0`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `candies`.
   - We need to ensure that `candies` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given the current state:
- `candies` is a positive integer reduced by `min(k, candies)` and further reduced by `candies // 10`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `candies` must be greater than 0 after the reduction.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `candies` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`candies` is a positive integer reduced by `min(k, candies)` then further reduced by `candies // 10`, and candies must be greater than 0**
