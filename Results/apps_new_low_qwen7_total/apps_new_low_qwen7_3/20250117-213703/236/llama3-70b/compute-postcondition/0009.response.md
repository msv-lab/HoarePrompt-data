To determine the final output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the given loop and the provided information step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Code and Initial State

The initial state is:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
- \( k = 1 \)
- \( \text{candies} = n \)
- \( \text{vasya\_eaten} = 0 \)

The loop is:
```python
while candies > 0:
    vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
    candies -= min(k, candies)
    petya_eaten = candies // 10
    candies -= petya_eaten
```

### Tracking Variable Changes

1. **Invariants**:
   - \( k = 1 \) remains constant.
   - \( \text{vasya\_eaten} \) accumulates the total number of candies eaten by Vasya.
   - \( \text{petya\_eaten} \) is determined based on the remaining candies.

2. **Behavior of Variables**:
   - Each iteration of the loop reduces `candies` by `min(k, candies)`, which is always 1 since \( k = 1 \). Therefore, `vasya_eaten` increases by 1 each time.
   - After each iteration, `petya_eaten` is set to `candies // 10` and then subtracted from `candies`.

### Summarizing the Loop Behavior

Each iteration of the loop decreases `candies` by 1 until `candies` becomes 0. During each iteration:
- Vasya eats 1 candy.
- Petya eats 1 candy out of every 10 remaining candies.

The loop will stop when `candies` is 0 or less.

### Verifying Relationships

Given the outputs after specific iterations, we can summarize:
- After 1 iteration: \( \text{candies} = n - 1 - (n - 1) // 10 \), \( \text{vasya\_eaten} = 1 \), \( \text{petya\_eaten} = (n - 1) // 10 \)
- After 2 iterations: \( \text{candies} \leq n - 2 - 2(n - 2) // 10 \), \( \text{vasya\_eaten} \) depends on \( n \), \( \text{petya\_eaten} = (n - 2) // 10 \)
- After 3 iterations: \( \text{candies} \leq n - 3 - 3(n - 3) // 10 \), \( \text{vasya\_eaten} \) depends on \( n \), \( \text{petya\_eaten} = (n - 3) // 10 \)

From this pattern, we see that:
- \( \text{vasya\_eaten} = n \) if \( n \leq 10 \), otherwise \( \text{vasya\_eaten} = n - n \% 10 \)
- \( \text{candies} \) becomes 0 after \( n \) iterations.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, the loop stops when `candies` is 0. Thus, the final output state is:
- \( \text{candies} = 0 \)
- \( \text{vasya\_eaten} = n \)
- \( \text{petya\_eaten} = 0 \) (since there are no candies left to distribute among Petya)

Output State: **candies is 0, k is 1, vasya\_eaten is n, petya\_eaten is 0.**
