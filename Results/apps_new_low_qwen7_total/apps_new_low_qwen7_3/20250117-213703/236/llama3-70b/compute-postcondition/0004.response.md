The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is 1
- `candies` is `n`
- `vasya_eaten` is 0

The code block to be executed is:
```
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Let's go through each line of the code:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`:
   - Since `k` is 1 and `candies` is `n`, `min(k, candies)` equals 1.
   - Therefore, `vasya_eaten` is incremented by 1, making `vasya_eaten` equal to 1.
   
2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`:
   - Again, `min(k, candies)` is 1.
   - So, `candies` is decremented by 1, making `candies` equal to `n - 1`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`:
   - `candies` is now `n - 1`.
   - `petya_eaten` is set to `(n - 1) // 10`.
   
4. `candies -= petya_eaten`:
   - `petya_eaten` is `(n - 1) // 10`.
   - `candies` is decremented by `(n - 1) // 10`, making `candies` equal to `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 10`.

After executing all the lines, the updated values are:
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` remains 1
- `candies` is now `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 10`
- `vasya_eaten` is 1
- `petya_eaten` is `(n - 1) // 10`

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), k is 1, candies is n - 1 - (n - 1) // 10, vasya_eaten is 1, petya_eaten is (n - 1) // 10**
