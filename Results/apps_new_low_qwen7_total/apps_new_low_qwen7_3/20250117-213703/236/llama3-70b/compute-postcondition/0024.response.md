Output State: **k is undefined, vasya_eaten is 2, petya_eaten is 0, candies is 0**

Explanation:
The provided code block consists of two statements. The first statement `print(k)` attempts to print the value of `k`, but since `k` is not defined anywhere in the given code or initial state, it will raise a NameError if executed. However, based on the instructions, we should avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines and instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. Since there are no assignments or operations affecting any of the variables (`vasya_eaten`, `petya_eaten`, `candies`), their values remain unchanged. The condition about `vasya_eaten` being greater than or equal to half of `n` is also not used in the provided code block and hence remains unaltered. Therefore, the final output state includes only the unchanged variables.
