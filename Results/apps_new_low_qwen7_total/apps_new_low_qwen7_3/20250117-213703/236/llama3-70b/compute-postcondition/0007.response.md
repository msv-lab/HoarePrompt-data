To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop continues:

The loop condition is `candies > 0`.

From the given information:
- `candies` is less than or equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `vasya_eaten` is the original value of `candies` if `candies` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `petya_eaten` is `candies` divided by 10 if `candies` is greater than 0, otherwise it is 0.

For the loop to continue executing, `candies` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `candies` is influenced by the loop's operations but primarily by the initial condition and how it changes within the loop.

Given that the loop condition is `candies > 0`, we need to ensure that `candies` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration. Since the loop body (which is omitted) is not specified, we assume it will decrement `candies` in some way.

The critical state to adjust is `candies` itself because the loop continues as long as `candies > 0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `candies` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.
