Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is 1**

Explanation:
- The first line `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to `n`. This updates the value of `n` based on user input, but does not change `k`.
- The second line `k = 1` initializes `k` to 1, which does not affect the value of `n` since it's a new assignment.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, maintaining the condition that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`.
