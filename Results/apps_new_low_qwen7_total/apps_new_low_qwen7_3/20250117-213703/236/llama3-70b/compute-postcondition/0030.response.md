Given the initial state, let's assume `candies` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `vasya_eaten` and `petya_eaten` are initialized to 0. We will now analyze the code block:

```python
vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
candies -= min(k, candies)
petya_eaten = candies // 10
candies -= petya_eaten
```

Let's break down each line:

1. `vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)`: This line adds the minimum of `k` and `candies` to `vasya_eaten`. The value of `vasya_eaten` will increase by the smaller of `k` or `candies`.

2. `candies -= min(k, candies)`: This line subtracts the minimum of `k` and `candies` from `candies`. After this line, `candies` will be reduced by the smaller of `k` or `candies`.

3. `petya_eaten = candies // 10`: This line calculates the integer division of `candies` by 10 and assigns the result to `petya_eaten`. `petya_eaten` will now hold this value.

4. `candies -= petya_eaten`: This line subtracts the value of `petya_eaten` from `candies`. After this, `candies` will be further reduced by the value of `petya_eaten`.

Combining these effects, we can summarize the final state as follows:

- `vasya_eaten` is increased by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `candies` is reduced by the minimum of `k` and `candies`.
- `petya_eaten` is set to the integer division of the remaining `candies` by 10.
- `candies` is further reduced by the value of `petya_eaten`.

Since we do not have specific values for `candies` and `k`, we can represent the final state generally:

Output State: **candies is reduced by the minimum of k and itself, vasya_eaten is increased by the minimum of k and candies, petya_eaten is the integer division of the remaining candies by 10, and candies is further reduced by petya_eaten**.
