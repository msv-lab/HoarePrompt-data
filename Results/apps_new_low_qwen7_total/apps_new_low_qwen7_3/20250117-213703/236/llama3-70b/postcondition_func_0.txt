The function determines the smallest integer \( k \) such that if Vasya eats \( k \) candies each time and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies, Vasya ends up eating at least half of the total candies \( n \). The function returns the value of \( k \) when this condition is met. If no such \( k \) is found within the given constraints (i.e., \( k \) increases indefinitely), the function will eventually break out of the loop and return the last valid \( k \) which satisfies the condition. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), and the function may take a long time to execute.
