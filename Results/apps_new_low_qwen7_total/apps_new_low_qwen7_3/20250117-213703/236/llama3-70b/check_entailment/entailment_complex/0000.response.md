Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func()` which reads the initial number of candies `n`.
2. It initializes `k` to 1 and enters a loop where it simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Vasya eats `min(k, candies)` candies.
   - Petya eats `candies // 10` candies.
4. The loop continues until Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies (`vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`).
5. Once the condition is met, the function prints `k` and breaks out of the loop.
6. The logic and implementation seem to correctly follow the problem's description without any apparent errors.

Given the annotated program, the function correctly implements the required logic and should work as intended for finding the minimal \( k \).

Correctness: **True**
