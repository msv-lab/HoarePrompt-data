You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $n$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.

This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats — next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya — $10\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.

If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.

Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial amount of candies in the box.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal amount of $k$ that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.


-----Example-----
Input
68

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample, the amount of candies, with $k=3$, would change in the following way (Vasya eats first):

$68 \to 65 \to 59 \to 56 \to 51 \to 48 \to 44 \to 41 \\ \to 37 \to 34 \to 31 \to 28 \to 26 \to 23 \to 21 \to 18 \to 17 \to 14 \\ \to 13 \to 10 \to 9 \to 6 \to 6 \to 3 \to 3 \to 0$.

In total, Vasya would eat $39$ candies, while Petya — $29$.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    while True:
        candies = n
        vasya_eaten = 0
        while candies > 0:
            vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
            candies -= min(k, candies)
            petya_eaten = candies // 10
            candies -= petya_eaten
        if vasya_eaten * 2 >= n:
            print(k)
            break
        k += 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    n = int(input())

k = 1
    while True:
        candies = n
        
        vasya_eaten = 0
        
        while candies > 0:
            vasya_eaten += min(k, candies)
            candies -= min(k, candies)
            petya_eaten = candies // 10
            candies -= petya_eaten
        
        if vasya_eaten * 2 >= n:
            print(k)
            break
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: candies: 0, k: 3, vasya_eaten: 2n, petya_eaten: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the smallest integer \( k \) such that if Vasya eats \( k \) candies each time and Petya eats one-tenth of the remaining candies, Vasya ends up eating at least half of the total candies \( n \). The function returns the value of \( k \) when this condition is met. If no such \( k \) is found within the given constraints (i.e., \( k \) increases indefinitely), the function will eventually break out of the loop and return the last valid \( k \) which satisfies the condition. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), and the function may take a long time to execute.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to ensure it follows the problem description accurately and produces the right output for the given input.

1. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the initial number of candies. It then attempts to find the minimum value of `k` such that Vasya eats at least half of the candies.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The outer `while True` loop starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` by 1 until the condition is met.
   - For each value of `k`, the inner `while` loop simulates the process of Vasya and Petya eating candies until the box is empty.
     - Vasya always eats `min(k, candies)` candies in the morning.
     - Petya eats `candies // 10` candies in the evening, rounded down.
   - The `vasya_eaten` variable keeps track of the total number of candies Vasya has eaten.
   - The loop terminates when `vasya_eaten * 2 >= n`, indicating Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies.
   - The program prints the current value of `k` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating how many candies Vasya and Petya eat each day is accurate according to the problem statement.
   - The program correctly checks whether Vasya has eaten at least half of the candies and stops the search once this condition is met.
   - The incrementation of `k` is done correctly to find the minimal value of `k`.

Given these points, the provided program accurately implements the required logic and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.
