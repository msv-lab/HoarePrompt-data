Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to attempt to solve the problem by using dynamic programming. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect State Transition**: The code updates `dp[i+a]` and `dp[i]` incorrectly. According to the problem, the frog can jump from `k` to `k+a` or `k-b`. Therefore, when processing index `i`, the code should add `dp[i-a]` to `dp[i]` and `dp[i+b]` to `dp[i+b]`.

2. **Boundary Conditions and Range Handling**: The current implementation might not handle boundary conditions properly. For example, `dp[i+a]` should only be updated if `i + a` is within the range `[0, m]`, and similarly for `dp[i-b]`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The final sum of `dp` should correctly reflect the number of distinct positions reachable from `0` up to `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    
    # Ensure that the dp array correctly captures reachable positions
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if dp[i] > 0:
            dp[i] = 1
    
    print(sum(dp))

func()
```

However, this still might not fully address the problem as intended because the original problem asks for the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, not the number of ways to reach them. A more appropriate approach would be to use a set to track distinct reachable positions:

```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    visited = {0}
    
    queue = [0]
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if queue:
            next_pos = set()
            for pos in queue:
                if pos + a <= m and pos + a not in visited:
                    next_pos.add(pos + a)
                    visited.add(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b not in visited:
                    next_pos.add(pos - b)
                    visited.add(pos - b)
            queue = list(next_pos)
    
    print(len(visited))

func()
```

This corrected version uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to ensure that each position is visited only once, maintaining the distinct count.

Based on the above analysis, the original annotated program has logical errors and does not fully solve the problem as intended. 

Correctness: **False**
