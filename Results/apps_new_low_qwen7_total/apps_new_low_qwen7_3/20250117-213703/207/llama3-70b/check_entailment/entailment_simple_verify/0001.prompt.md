You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.

Input

Output

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())

dp = [0] * (m + 1)

dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of length `m+1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for each `i` from `1` to `m`, `dp[i]` is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values such that `j + a <= i` and `j - b >= 0`.
    print(sum(dp))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions the frog can reach for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\), and then sum these values. The provided solution uses dynamic programming to achieve this:

1. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of distinct positions the frog can reach up to position `i`.
2. It sets `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.
3. For each position `i` from 0 to `m`, it checks if the frog can jump to `i + a` or `i - b` within the range `[0, m]`.
4. If the jump is valid, it updates the corresponding `dp` value.
5. Finally, it prints the sum of all `dp[i]` values from 0 to `m`.

The logic in the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of reachable positions for each position `i`.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
