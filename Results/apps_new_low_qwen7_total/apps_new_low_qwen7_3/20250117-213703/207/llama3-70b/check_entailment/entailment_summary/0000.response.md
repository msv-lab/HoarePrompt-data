Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of calculating the number of distinct integers the frog can reach up to \(m\) using jumps of size \(a\) or \(-b\). The program uses dynamic programming to achieve this.

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with all zeros except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. This initialization ensures that the starting point (position 0) is counted as reachable.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each position \(i\) from 0 to \(m\), the program checks if jumping \(a\) positions forward or \(b\) positions backward would still be within the bounds of the array (i.e., not negative or exceeding \(m\)). If so, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.
3. **Result Calculation**: After filling the `dp` array, the program sums all the elements in the `dp` array to get the total number of distinct positions reachable from 0 up to each position \(i\).
4. **Output**: The sum is printed, which represents the cumulative count of distinct reachable positions up to \(m\).

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the logic in the provided code aligns with the requirements. The program correctly uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct reachable positions and sums these values as required.

Correctness: **True**
