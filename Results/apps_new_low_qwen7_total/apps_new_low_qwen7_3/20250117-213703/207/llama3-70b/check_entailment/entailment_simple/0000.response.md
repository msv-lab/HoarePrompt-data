### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves determining how many distinct positions a frog can reach within the interval `[0, m]` using jumps of size `a` or `-b` starting from position `0`. 
   - The goal is to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0` but staying within the interval `[0, i]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The provided code uses dynamic programming (`dp` array) to keep track of reachable positions.
   - `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct positions reachable up to `i` without going out of bounds.
   - For each `i`, the code updates `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i - b]` if the new positions remain within the interval `[0, m]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly initializes `dp[0] = 1` because the starting position `0` is always reachable.
   - The loop iterates over each possible position `i` from `0` to `m`, updating the `dp` array based on the conditions `i + a <= m` and `i - b >= 0`.
   - After the loop, the final result is obtained by summing all elements in the `dp` array, which gives the required sum of `f(i)` from `0` to `m`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\) are handled properly by the dynamic programming approach.
   - The algorithm efficiently computes the solution without needing to simulate every possible jump path explicitly.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is computed correctly by summing the values in the `dp` array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It handles all the necessary cases and constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
