Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there is a logical error in the way the `dp` array is updated. Specifically, the line `if i - b >= 0: dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it updates `dp[i]` instead of `dp[i + b]`. This means the program will incorrectly include states that are not reachable within the interval `[0, m]`.

For example, consider the input `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`. The program will update `dp[5]` and `dp[2]` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect count of reachable positions. The correct approach would be to update `dp[i + b]` instead of `dp[i]`.

To fix this, the line should be changed to:
```python
if i - b >= 0:
    dp[i + b] += dp[i]
```

This ensures that only the positions that are actually reachable from the current position are updated correctly. Without this fix, the program will produce incorrect results for many inputs.
