Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions the frog can reach for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\), and then sum these values. The provided solution uses dynamic programming to achieve this:

1. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of distinct positions the frog can reach up to position `i`.
2. It sets `dp[0] = 1` because the frog starts at position 0.
3. For each position `i` from 0 to `m`, it checks if the frog can jump to `i + a` or `i - b` within the range `[0, m]`.
4. If the jump is valid, it updates the corresponding `dp` value.
5. Finally, it prints the sum of all `dp[i]` values from 0 to `m`.

The logic in the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of reachable positions for each position `i`.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
