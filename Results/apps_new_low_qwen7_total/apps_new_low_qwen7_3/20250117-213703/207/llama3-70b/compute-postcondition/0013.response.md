Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is in the range from 0 to `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 2, and the rest are 0.
   - The condition `if i - b` is non-negative, then `dp[1]` is increased by `dp[1 - b]`. However, since `i` was 1, this condition did not apply, as `1 - b` would result in a negative index if `b` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1, the next value of `i` will be 2 (as the loop increments `i` by 1).
   - The length of `dp` remains `m+1`.
   - The condition for increasing `dp[1]` by `dp[1 - b]` still does not apply because `1 - b` will still be negative if `b` is 1 or more.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `dp` remains an array of length `m+1` with the first element being 2 and the rest being 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 2, and the rest are 0**.
