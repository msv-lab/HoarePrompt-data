The code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` increments the value of `dp[i + a]` by the value of `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `dp` is a list with `m` zeros starting from index 1 (since `dp` is initialized as `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`), the value of `dp[0 + a]` (which is `dp[a]`) will be incremented by `dp[0]`, which is 1.

Therefore, `dp[a]` becomes `dp[a] + 1`. All other values in `dp` remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0; `dp` is [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] with `m` zeros, and `dp[a]` is 1**
