The code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` increments the value of `dp[i + a]` by `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 2 and the rest are 0.

Let's calculate the impact:
- Initially, `dp[2]` is 2.
- The code will add `dp[2]` (which is 2) to `dp[i + a]`. Since `i` is 2, `dp[i + a]` becomes `dp[2 + a]`.
- Therefore, `dp[2 + a]` will be incremented by 2.

The output state will be:
Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp[2 + a]` is 2; the rest of `dp` are 0**
