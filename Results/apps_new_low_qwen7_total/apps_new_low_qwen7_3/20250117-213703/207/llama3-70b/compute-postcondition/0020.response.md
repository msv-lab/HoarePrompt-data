The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameter constraints are that `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). However, since these parameters are not passed as arguments to the function, they are not part of the function's parameter list.

Given the output cases are not specified directly within the function definition, we can infer that the function may internally use `m`, `a`, and `b` to compute something, but these are not provided as function parameters.

Since there are no return cases specified in the given function definition, we can only state the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, but it is constrained by the conditions \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).**
