Functionality: **The function reads three integers \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) from input, where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It then initializes a list `dp` of length \(m+1\) with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. The function iterates over the range from 0 to \(m\) and updates the `dp` list based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\): for each index \(i\), it adds the value of `dp[i-a]` to `dp[i+a]` and the value of `dp[i+b]` to `dp[i]`. After the iteration, it prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` list. This sum represents the number of ways to reach the index \(m\) using steps of size \(a\) or \(-b\).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(m = 0\), the function will still initialize `dp[0]` to 1 and then print 1, as there is exactly one way to stay at index 0 (doing nothing).
- If \(a > m\) or \(b > m\), the corresponding additions in the `dp` list will not affect the elements because the indices will go out of bounds (though the code itself does not handle these cases, they are implied by the problem constraints).
