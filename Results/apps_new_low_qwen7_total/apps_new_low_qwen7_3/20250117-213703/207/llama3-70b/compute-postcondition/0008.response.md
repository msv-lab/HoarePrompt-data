Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 2, and the rest are 0.
   - If `i - b` is non-negative, then `dp[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `m`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `m`, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - We need to check if `i - b` is non-negative for `i = 1`. If it is, then `dp[1]` will be set to 2; otherwise, it will remain 0.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `dp` will either remain the same or the element `dp[1]` might change based on the condition `i - b`.

Given these points, let's determine the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be 1.
- `dp` will remain an array of length `m+1` with the first element being 2 and the rest being 0. However, if `1 - b` is non-negative, then `dp[1]` will be set to 2.

Since we cannot predict the exact value of `b`, we can only say that `dp[1]` might change if `1 - b` is non-negative. But without knowing the exact value of `b`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `dp` remains unchanged (i.e., `dp[1]` remains 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 2, and the rest are 0.**
