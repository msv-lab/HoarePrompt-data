Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `dp` is an array of length `m+1` where the first element is 1, and the rest are 0. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is set to 1. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `b` and `dp` remains unchanged unless `i - b` is non-negative, in which case `dp` is updated as per the if condition.***
