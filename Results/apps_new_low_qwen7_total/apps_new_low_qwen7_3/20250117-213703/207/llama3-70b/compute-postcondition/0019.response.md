The code `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp` and prints it. This operation does not change the values of the elements in the list `dp`. Therefore, the list `dp` remains unchanged, and only its sum is printed.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m+1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for each `i` from `1` to `m`, `dp[i]` is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values such that `j + a <= i` and `j - b >= 0`; the sum of `dp` is printed.**
