The `print('YES')` statement does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `t`, and `s`. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `c`, `t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, \(x > t\), and both \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\) are still true. Additionally, the current value of \((x - t) \% s\) is equal to 0. Printed output: YES**
