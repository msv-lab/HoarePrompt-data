Postcondition: ***`t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, `x` is `c`, and \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\) are still true. If \(x > t\), the function prints "YES" if \((x - t) \% s == 0\); it checks if \((x - t - 1) \% s == 0\) and \(x \neq t + 1\). If these conditions are met, certain conditions are satisfied; otherwise, \((x - t - 1) \% s \neq 0\) or \(x = t + 1\). If \(x \leq t\), the conditions from the precondition are preserved and the function does nothing additional regarding the print statement.***
