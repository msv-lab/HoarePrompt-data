The code `t, s, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `t`, `s`, and `x`. Since the input is not specified, let's denote the input integers as `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. After the code executes, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` will be `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

The initial conditions are that `t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). After the code executes, these conditions are still valid, but the actual values of `t`, `s`, and `x` are now the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, `x` is `c`, and both \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\) are still true.**
