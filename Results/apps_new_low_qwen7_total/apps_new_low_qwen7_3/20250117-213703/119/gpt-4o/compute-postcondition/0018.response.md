The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions involving non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` where 0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.

However, since the function body is not provided, we can only describe the conditions that would lead to different return values:

- Case_1: `t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers within the specified ranges. If a specific condition related to these variables is met, the function returns a particular value (this condition is not provided).
- Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met, the function returns another value (this condition is also not provided).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a value based on conditions involving non-negative integers `t`, `s`, and `x` within specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on conditions involving non-negative integers t, s, and x within specified ranges.**
