The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not change any of the variable values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, `x` is `c`, and \(x \neq t\), both \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\) are still true, and \(x \leq t\)**
