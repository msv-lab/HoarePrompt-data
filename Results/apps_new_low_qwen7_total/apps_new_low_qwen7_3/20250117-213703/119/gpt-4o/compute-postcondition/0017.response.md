Postcondition: ***`t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, `x` is `c`, and \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\) are still true. If \(x > t\), the function prints "YES" if \((x - t) \% s == 0\). If \(x > t\) and \((x - t) \% s \neq 0\) or \(x = t + 1\), the function prints nothing. If \(x \leq t\), the function does nothing additional regarding the print statement.***
