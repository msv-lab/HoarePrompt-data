The code snippet prints 'YES'. Printing does not change the values of variables, so the values of `x`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged. The condition `(x - t - 1) % s` remains true, as no changes are made to the variables involved in this condition.

Output State: **`x` is `c`, `t` is `a`, `s` is `b`, and the value of `(x - t - 1) % s` is 0.**
