You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Ted has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t + s, t + s + 1, t + 2s, t + 2s + 1, etc.

Barney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0 ≤ t, x ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 10 4

Output
NO

Input
3 10 3

Output
YES

Input
3 8 51

Output
YES

Input
3 8 52

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.

In the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.

- Program: 
def func():
    (t, s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == t:
        print('YES')
    elif x > t:
        if (x - t) % s == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif (x - t - 1) % s == 0 and x != t + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

If \(x > t\), the function prints "YES" if \((x - t) \% s == 0\); it checks if \((x - t - 1) \% s == 0\) and \(x \neq t + 1\). If these conditions are met, certain conditions are satisfied; otherwise, \((x - t - 1) \% s \neq 0\) or \(x = t + 1\). If \(x \leq t\), the conditions from the precondition are preserved and the function does nothing additional regarding the print statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program needs to determine if the pineapple will bark at a specific time `x`. The pineapple barks for the first time at `t` and then every `s` seconds, it barks twice (once at `t + s` and once at `t + s + 1`). To check if the pineapple will bark at time `x`, we need to see if `x` matches either `t + ks` or `t + ks + 1` for some integer `k`.

Let's analyze the logic of the given program:

1. It correctly checks if `x` is equal to `t` and prints 'YES' if so.
2. If `x` is greater than `t`, it checks if `(x - t)` is divisible by `s` which would mean `x` is at a time where the pineapple barks the first time after `t`.
3. It also correctly checks if `(x - t - 1)` is divisible by `s` and ensures `x` is not immediately after the first bark to avoid false positives.

The conditions cover all possible scenarios where `x` could be a time when the pineapple barks. Therefore, the logic is sound.
