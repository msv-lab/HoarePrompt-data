The function takes three non-negative integers \(t\), \(s\), and \(x\) as input, where \(0 \leq t, x \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq s \leq 10^9\). It checks if \(x\) can be expressed as \(t + k \cdot s\) for some integer \(k\), considering two special cases when \(x = t + 1\). If \(x = t\), the function prints "YES". If \(x > t\) and \((x - t) \% s == 0\), the function also prints "YES". If \(x > t\) and \((x - t) \% s \neq 0\) or \(x = t + 1\), the function prints "NO". If \(x \leq t\), the function prints "NO". The function does not return a value but prints one of "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions checked.
