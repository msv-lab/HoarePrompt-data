The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and `b` is greater than 0. It then performs a series of operations involving a bitwise operation and a custom function `func_1`. Specifically, it repeatedly applies `func_1` to `a` with itself `log2(b)` times and also uses `func_1` to update `res` when `b` is odd. After the loop completes, the function returns `res`, which is always set to 1 regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `b` is 1, the loop runs once and `res` is updated once, but since `b` becomes 0 immediately after, `res` remains 1.
- If `b` is even, the loop runs without updating `res` when `b` is odd, and `a` is updated `log2(b)` times using `func_1`.

Missing functionality: There is no explicit check for `a` being 0, which might lead to undefined behavior if `func_1` is not defined for such inputs. However, given the return value of 1, it seems the function inherently handles such cases, possibly by ensuring `res` is always 1.
