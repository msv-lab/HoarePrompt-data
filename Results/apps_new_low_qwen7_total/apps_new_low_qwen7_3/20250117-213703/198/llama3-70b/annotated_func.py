#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b < 998244353, and MOD is a constant integer equal to 998244353.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b % MOD
    #`The program returns (a * b) % 998244353`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, both constrained such that \(0 \leq a, b < 998244353\). It computes the product of `a` and `b` and then takes the result modulo 998244353. The function returns this computed value. Since the code does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` might be 0 or very close to the upper limit of 998244353, these edge cases are inherently managed by the modulo operation itself, ensuring the result remains within the specified range. No additional functionality or missing logic was found in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, and b is greater than 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b > 0:
        if b & 1:
            res = func_1(res, a)
        
        a = func_1(a, a)
        
        b >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is `func_1(...func_1(a_initial, a_initial)...)` (applied `log2(b_initial)` times), b is 0, res is 1.
    return res
    #The program returns res which is equal to 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and `b` is greater than 0. It then performs a series of operations involving a bitwise operation and a custom function `func_1`. Specifically, it repeatedly applies `func_1` to `a` with itself `log2(b)` times and also uses `func_1` to update `res` when `b` is odd. After the loop completes, the function returns `res`, which is always set to 1 regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `b` is 1, the loop runs once and `res` is updated once, but since `b` becomes 0 immediately after, `res` remains 1.
- If `b` is even, the loop runs without updating `res` when `b` is odd, and `a` is updated `log2(b)` times using `func_1`.

Missing functionality: There is no explicit check for `a` being 0, which might lead to undefined behavior if `func_1` is not defined for such inputs. However, given the return value of 1, it seems the function inherently handles such cases, possibly by ensuring `res` is always 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer such that \(1 \leq a < 998244353\)
def func_3(a):
    return func_2(a, MOD - 2)
    #The program returns the value of `func_2(a, 998244351)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `a` where \(1 \leq a < 998244353\). It then calls another function `func_2` with arguments `a` and `998244351`, and returns the result of this call. There are no additional operations performed within `func_3` other than making this function call. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_3` concludes is that it has returned the result of `func_2(a, 998244351)`. No further actions are taken with the input variable `a` beyond passing it to `func_2`.
