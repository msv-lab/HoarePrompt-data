### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - The number of accepted solutions for each problem \(i\) ranges from \(l_i\) to \(r_i\).
   - The result should be an irreducible fraction \(\frac{x}{y}\), where \(y\) is coprime with \(998244353\).
   - The output should be \(xy^{-1} \mod 998244353\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Helper Functions**:
     - `func_1(a, b)`: Implements modular multiplication \(a \times b \mod 998244353\).
     - `func_2(a, b)`: Implements modular exponentiation using the square-and-multiply algorithm.
     - `func_3(a)`: Computes the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(998244353\).

   - **Main Logic**:
     - The main part of the code iterates through each problem and calculates the number of valid sequences of solutions.
       - For each problem \(i\), it calculates the number of valid sequences for the remaining problems \(j\) such that \(j > i\) and \(a[i][0] \leq a[j][1]\).
       - It multiplies these counts together to get the total number of valid sequences.
     - Finally, it multiplies the result by the number of valid sequences for each individual problem.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res = 1`: Initialize the result to 1.
   
2. **First Loop (Count Valid Sequences for Remaining Problems)**:
   - For each problem \(i\), it checks all subsequent problems \(j\) (where \(j > i\)).
   - If \(a[i][0] \leq a[j][1]\), it increments the count `cnt` by the number of possible values for \(a[j][1]\) minus \(a[i][0] + 1\).
   - It then updates `res` by multiplying it with `cnt`.

3. **Second Loop (Count Valid Sequences for Each Individual Problem)**:
   - For each problem \(i\), it multiplies `res` by the number of valid sequences for \(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1\).

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - `func_3(a[i][1] - a[i][0] + 1)`: This computes the modular inverse of the number of possible values for \(a[i][1]\) minus \(a[i][0] + 1\).

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid sequences without inversions. It uses the modular arithmetic functions correctly to handle large numbers and compute the necessary probabilities. The logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the provided code does indeed implement the required functionality to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
