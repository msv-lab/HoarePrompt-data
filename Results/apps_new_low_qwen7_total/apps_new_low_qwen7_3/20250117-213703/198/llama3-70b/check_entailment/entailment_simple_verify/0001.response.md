### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the annotated code and the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
- An inversion is a pair of problems \((x, y)\) such that \(x < y\) but the number of accepted solutions for \(y\) is strictly greater than for \(x\).
- The probability for each problem \(i\) to have a specific number of accepted solutions is uniform between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).

#### Functions Analysis:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: Computes \(a \times b \mod \text{MOD}\). This function is correctly implemented.
2. **`func_2(a, b)`**: Computes \(a^b \mod \text{MOD}\) using exponentiation by squaring. This function is also correctly implemented.
3. **`func_3(a)`**: Computes \(a^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD}\), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\). This function is correctly implemented.

#### Code Analysis:
- The code iterates through each problem and computes the probability that it does not create an inversion with any of the previous problems.
- It uses the function `func_1` to multiply probabilities and `func_3` to compute modular inverses.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD` is set to 998244353.
   - `n` is read from input.
   - `a` is a list of pairs \([l_i, r_i]\) for each problem.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For each problem \(i\), it calculates the number of valid ranges for the next problem \(j\) (where \(j > i\)) such that \(a_i \leq a_j\).
   - This is done by iterating over all subsequent problems and counting the number of valid ranges for \(a_j\).

3. **Cumulative Probability**:
   - The result is updated by multiplying the cumulative probability with the count of valid ranges.
   - The modular inverse is used to ensure the final result is in the correct form.

#### Key Points:
- The code correctly handles the calculation of probabilities and ensures that the modular arithmetic is performed correctly.
- The use of modular inverses is appropriate to keep the final result within the required constraints.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic for computing probabilities and ensuring no inversions is sound.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the necessary calculations to determine the probability of no inversions.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
