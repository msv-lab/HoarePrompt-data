### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - An inversion occurs if for any pair of problems \( (x, y) \) such that \( x < y \), the number of accepted solutions for \( y \) is strictly greater than for \( x \).
   - Each problem \( i \) can have a number of accepted solutions between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \), inclusive.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - The probability for each problem \( i \) to have a specific number of accepted solutions is uniform between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
   - To ensure no inversions, for each problem \( i \), we need to consider the range of possible values for \( b_i \) such that \( b_i \geq a_j \) for all \( j < i \).

3. **Functions Provided:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes \( a \times b \mod \text{MOD} \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \( a^b \mod \text{MOD} \) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes \( a^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD} \), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( a \).

4. **Calculation of Probability:**
   - For each problem \( i \), the probability that it has a non-inverting order with all previous problems can be computed.
   - The probability that \( b_i \geq a_j \) for all \( j < i \) is given by the ratio of the range of possible values of \( b_i \) that satisfy this condition.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The code iterates through each problem and computes the cumulative product of the probabilities using the modular inverse for the denominator.
   - `func_1` correctly handles modular multiplication.
   - `func_2` correctly implements exponentiation by squaring, which is used to compute modular inverses.
   - `func_3` computes the modular inverse using `func_2`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `MOD` is correctly defined as \( 998244353 \).
   - `n` is read from input and the range of accepted solutions for each problem is stored in `a`.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The outer loop iterates through each problem \( i \).
   - For each problem \( i \), `cnt` is initialized to 1.
   - The inner loop iterates through all subsequent problems \( j \) and updates `cnt` by counting the number of valid values for \( b_j \) such that \( b_j \geq a_i \).
   - `res` is updated by multiplying the current result with `cnt` using `func_1`.
   - After the inner loop, `res` is further updated by multiplying with the modular inverse of the range of possible values for \( b_i \) using `func_3`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles the case where \( a_i = r_i \), as it ensures that `cnt` includes all valid values for \( b_j \).
   - The use of `func_1` and `func_3` ensures that all intermediate and final results remain within the required range and are correctly computed.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the intermediate results do not overflow and the final result is correctly reduced modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Conclusion:

The annotated code correctly implements the necessary logic to compute the probability of no inversions in the problem order. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are appropriately used to handle modular multiplication, exponentiation, and modular inverses. The overall structure of the code matches the problem requirements and the reasoning provided in the original assessment.
