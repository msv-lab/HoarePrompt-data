### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the annotated code and its logic step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

1. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1`: This function correctly performs the modulo multiplication operation.
   - `func_2`: This function correctly implements exponentiation using the square-and-multiply algorithm.
   - `func_3`: This function calculates the modular inverse of `a` using `func_2`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the code initializes `res` to 1.
   - It iterates over each problem `i` and for each subsequent problem `j`:
     - It checks if `a[i][0] <= a[j][1]`. If true, it means problem `i` can come before problem `j` without violating the inversion condition.
     - It updates `cnt` with the number of valid configurations for problem `j` given the constraints of problem `i`.
   - It then multiplies `res` by `cnt` to accumulate the number of valid configurations up to that point.
   - Finally, it multiplies `res` by the number of valid configurations for each problem independently.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the logic:
- `a[i][0]` and `a[i][1]` represent the lower and upper bounds for the number of accepted solutions for problem `i`.
- For each problem `i`, `cnt` counts how many ways problem `j` can be placed such that the number of accepted solutions for `j` is at least as large as the number of solutions for `i`.
- The product of these counts gives the number of valid configurations up to problem `i`.
- The final `res` is calculated as the product of all such counts, effectively counting the number of non-inverting sequences.

Given this logic, the code indeed implements the necessary steps to count the number of non-inverting sequences. Here’s why the original assessment is incorrect:

- The code does use the provided helper functions appropriately to perform the required arithmetic operations.
- The logic correctly calculates the number of valid sequences without inversions.
- The final result is computed correctly and matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the code is incorrect. The actual code is correct in implementing the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
