You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An online contest will soon be held on ForceCoders, a large competitive programming platform. The authors have prepared $n$ problems; and since the platform is very popular, $998244351$ coder from all over the world is going to solve them.

For each problem, the authors estimated the number of people who would solve it: for the $i$-th problem, the number of accepted solutions will be between $l_i$ and $r_i$, inclusive.

The creator of ForceCoders uses different criteria to determine if the contest is good or bad. One of these criteria is the number of inversions in the problem order. An inversion is a pair of problems $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is located earlier in the contest ($x < y$), but the number of accepted solutions for $y$ is strictly greater.

Obviously, both the creator of ForceCoders and the authors of the contest want the contest to be good. Now they want to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, assuming that for each problem $i$, any integral number of accepted solutions for it (between $l_i$ and $r_i$) is equally probable, and all these numbers are independent.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — the number of problems in the contest.

Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \le l_i \le r_i \le 998244351$) — the minimum and maximum number of accepted solutions for the $i$-th problem, respectively.


-----Output-----

The probability that there will be no inversions in the contest can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is coprime with $998244353$. Print one integer — the value of $xy^{-1}$, taken modulo $998244353$, where $y^{-1}$ is an integer such that $yy^{-1} \equiv 1$ $(mod$ $998244353)$.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b > 0:
        if b & 1:
            res = func_1(res, a)
        a = func_1(a, a)
        b >>= 1
    return res

#Function 3:
def func_3(a):
    return func_2(a, MOD - 2)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts an integer `a` where \(1 \leq a < 998244353\). It then calls another function `func_2` with arguments `a` and `998244351`, and returns the result of this call. There are no additional operations performed within `func_3` other than making this function call. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_3` concludes is that it has returned the result of `func_2(a, 998244351)`. No further actions are taken with the input variable `a` beyond passing it to `func_2`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the functions and their roles within the context of the problem:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - This involves calculating the product of probabilities for each problem to maintain a non-inverting order.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - An inversion is a pair of problems \( (x, y) \) such that \( x < y \) but the number of accepted solutions for \( y \) is strictly greater than for \( x \).
   - The probability for each problem \( i \) to have a specific number of accepted solutions is uniform between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).

3. **Functions Provided:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes \( a \times b \mod \text{MOD} \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \( a^b \mod \text{MOD} \) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes \( a^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD} \), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( a \).

4. **Calculation of Probability:**
   - For each problem \( i \), the probability that it has a non-inverting order with all previous problems can be computed.
   - If \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are the number of solutions for problems \( i-1 \) and \( i \), respectively, the probability that \( a_{i-1} \leq b_i \) is given by the ratio of the range of possible values of \( b_i \) that satisfy this condition.

5. **Modular Inverses:**
   - The modular inverse function `func_3` is used to compute \( y^{-1} \) where \( y \) is coprime with \( \text{MOD} = 998244353 \).

6. **Implementation:**
   - The code needs to iterate through each problem and compute the cumulative product of the probabilities using the modular inverse for the denominator.

Given the problem statement and the functions provided, the code appears to correctly handle the necessary computations. The functions for modular multiplication and modular exponentiation are well-known algorithms and are implemented correctly. The modular inverse function also seems appropriate for the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions appear to be correctly implementing the necessary operations to solve the problem as described.
