### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the problem and the provided functions step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - Each problem \(i\) has a number of accepted solutions between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).
   - We need to ensure that for every pair \((x, y)\) where \(x < y\), the number of accepted solutions for \(x\) is not greater than for \(y\).

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - An inversion occurs when \(x < y\) and \(b_x > b_y\).
   - The probability for each problem \(i\) to have a specific number of accepted solutions is uniform between \(l_i\) and \(r_i\).

3. **Functions Provided:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes \(a \times b \mod \text{MOD}\).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \(a^b \mod \text{MOD}\) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes \(a^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD}\), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(a\).

4. **Calculation of Probability:**
   - For each problem \(i\), we need to calculate the probability that it does not create an inversion with any of the previous problems.
   - The probability that the number of accepted solutions for problem \(i\) is less than or equal to the number of solutions for any of the previous problems is the sum of the probabilities for each possible number of solutions for problem \(i\).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The code needs to iterate through each problem and compute the cumulative product of the probabilities using the modular inverse for the denominator.

However, the original assessment did not provide the actual implementation details, so let's break down the expected steps:

- **Iterate through each problem \(i\):**
  - Calculate the probability that problem \(i\) does not create an inversion with any of the previous problems.
  - This involves computing the cumulative product of probabilities.

- **Compute the cumulative product:**
  - For each problem \(i\), the probability is the product of the ratios of the ranges of acceptable solutions for all previous problems.

- **Modular Inverses:**
  - Use the modular inverse to compute the final result in the form \(xy^{-1} \mod 998244353\).

Given the provided functions, the implementation should correctly perform the following:
- Compute the modular inverse of the denominator.
- Compute the product of probabilities for each problem.
- Ensure the final result is in the required form.

However, the original assessment did not provide enough information about the actual implementation of the main logic, which is crucial for verifying the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
Since the original assessment did not provide sufficient details about the main logic and the specific implementation steps, it is challenging to definitively conclude the correctness without seeing the full implementation.

**Final: False**

The original assessment may be partially correct based on the provided function summaries, but without the full implementation details, it is not possible to definitively confirm the correctness of the entire program.
