Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order based on the number of accepted solutions for each problem. This involves understanding the constraints and the nature of the input.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the modulo multiplication operation, which is essential for handling large numbers efficiently.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to perform modular exponentiation. However, the function returns 1 in every case, which is incorrect because it should compute \(a^b \mod \text{MOD}\). This suggests a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_2`.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function incorrectly calls `func_2(a, MOD - 2)`, which is supposed to compute the modular inverse. Given that `func_2` returns 1, this approach will not work as intended.

3. **Expected Correct Implementation**:
   - To calculate the probability of no inversions, we need to consider the constraints on the number of accepted solutions for each problem and ensure that the number of accepted solutions for earlier problems is not less than that of later problems.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the product of the binomial coefficients for each problem's range, which needs to be handled properly using modular arithmetic.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the required probability due to the flawed `func_2` and `func_3` functions. Therefore, the provided code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
