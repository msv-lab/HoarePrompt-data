### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the functions and their roles within the context of the problem:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - This involves calculating the product of probabilities for each problem to maintain a non-inverting order.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - An inversion is a pair of problems \( (x, y) \) such that \( x < y \) but the number of accepted solutions for \( y \) is strictly greater than for \( x \).
   - The probability for each problem \( i \) to have a specific number of accepted solutions is uniform between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).

3. **Functions Provided:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes \( a \times b \mod \text{MOD} \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Computes \( a^b \mod \text{MOD} \) using exponentiation by squaring.
   - `func_3(a)`: Computes \( a^{(\text{MOD} - 2)} \mod \text{MOD} \), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( a \).

4. **Calculation of Probability:**
   - For each problem \( i \), the probability that it has a non-inverting order with all previous problems can be computed.
   - If \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are the number of solutions for problems \( i-1 \) and \( i \), respectively, the probability that \( a_{i-1} \leq b_i \) is given by the ratio of the range of possible values of \( b_i \) that satisfy this condition.

5. **Modular Inverses:**
   - The modular inverse function `func_3` is used to compute \( y^{-1} \) where \( y \) is coprime with \( \text{MOD} = 998244353 \).

6. **Implementation:**
   - The code needs to iterate through each problem and compute the cumulative product of the probabilities using the modular inverse for the denominator.

Given the problem statement and the functions provided, the code appears to correctly handle the necessary computations. The functions for modular multiplication and modular exponentiation are well-known algorithms and are implemented correctly. The modular inverse function also seems appropriate for the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions appear to be correctly implementing the necessary operations to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
