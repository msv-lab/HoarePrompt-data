### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to compute the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order, given the constraints on the number of accepted solutions for each problem. The solution should use modular arithmetic due to the large size of the input values.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - For each problem \(i\), we need to consider the number of ways to assign values to \(i\) such that no inversion occurs.
   - If \(a_i[0] \leq a_j[1]\) for some \(j > i\), it means that problem \(i\) must have fewer accepted solutions than problem \(j\). This is handled by calculating the count of valid assignments for each problem considering the previous problems' constraints.
   - The function `func_1` handles the multiplication under modulo \(998244353\).
   - The function `func_2` calculates the modular inverse using the method of repeated squaring.
   - The function `func_3` uses `func_2` to find the modular inverse of \(a\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The main logic iterates through each problem and calculates the count of valid assignments for each subsequent problem.
   - The final result is computed by combining these counts and adjusting for the number of valid solutions for each problem.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` correctly performs the modulo multiplication.
   - `func_2` correctly implements the modular inverse using repeated squaring.
   - `func_3` correctly uses `func_2` to get the modular inverse.

5. **State Transitions**:
   - The state transitions are correctly managed within the loops and function calls.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when the lower bound equals the upper bound (e.g., single possible value) and when no inversions are possible.

Given the correct implementation of functions and the logic flow, the annotated program matches the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program is logically sound and correctly implements the required algorithm. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
