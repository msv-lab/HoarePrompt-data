### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided implementation matches the problem statement and the requirements specified. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order.
   - Each problem's number of accepted solutions \( x_i \) is uniformly distributed between \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
   - An inversion occurs if \( x_i > x_j \) for \( i < j \).

2. **Key Points in the Implementation**:
   - The input is read into a list of pairs \([l_i, r_i]\).
   - The probability calculation involves:
     - Ensuring that no inversion exists among the problems.
     - Using modular arithmetic and modular inverse due to the large size of the numbers involved.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs multiplication under modulo \( 998244353 \).
   - It correctly handles the modulo operation to keep results within bounds.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function implements modular exponentiation.
   - It calculates \( a^b \mod 998244353 \) efficiently using repeated squaring.
   - It returns the correct result for any valid inputs.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function calculates \( a^{(998244353-2)} \mod 998244353 \), which is the modular inverse of \( a \) under modulo \( 998244353 \).

6. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through each problem and calculates the probability of no inversions.
   - For each problem \( i \):
     - `cnt` counts how many problems \( j \) (where \( j > i \)) have \( l_j \leq r_i \).
     - `res` accumulates the product of probabilities using `func_1`.
   - After iterating through all problems, it adjusts the probabilities for each individual range \([l_i, r_i]\) using `func_3`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: Correctly multiplies and takes modulo.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: Correctly implements modular exponentiation.
- **Correctness of `func_3`**: Correctly calculates the modular inverse.
- **Main Logic**:
  - The logic correctly calculates the probability of no inversions by considering the ranges of possible values for each problem.
  - It ensures that the probability is calculated correctly by multiplying the probabilities for each problem using `func_1`.

Given the implementation and the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
