Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to calculate the probability that there will be no inversions in the problem order. Instead, it contains three helper functions for modular multiplication, exponentiation, and modular inverse, which are not used in solving the problem.

To solve this problem, the program needs to:

1. Generate all possible sequences of the number of accepted solutions for each problem.
2. Count the number of sequences where there are no inversions.
3. Calculate the total number of possible sequences.
4. Compute the probability and output the result as specified.

Since the provided code does not contain any logic related to the main problem, it fails to meet the requirements and thus is incorrect.
