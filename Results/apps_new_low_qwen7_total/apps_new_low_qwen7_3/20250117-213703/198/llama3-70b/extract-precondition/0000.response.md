Precondition: **a is an integer such that \(1 \leq a < 998244353\)**.

Explanation: The function `func_3` is designed to compute the modular inverse of a number \(a\) under modulo \(998244353\). The input \(a\) must be an integer within the specified range to ensure the modular inverse exists and the computation is valid.
