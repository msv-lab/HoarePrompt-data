The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, both constrained such that \(0 \leq a, b < 998244353\). It computes the product of `a` and `b` and then takes the result modulo 998244353. The function returns this computed value. Since the code does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` might be 0 or very close to the upper limit of 998244353, these edge cases are inherently managed by the modulo operation itself, ensuring the result remains within the specified range. No additional functionality or missing logic was found in the provided code.
