The code `res = func_1(res, a)` assigns the return value of `func_1(res, a)` to `res`. Since `func_1` is not defined, its behavior is unknown. However, we know the initial state and the fact that `b` is an odd number greater than 0, and `res` is 1. After the assignment, `res` will hold the return value of `func_1(1, a)`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `b` greater than 0; `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`**
