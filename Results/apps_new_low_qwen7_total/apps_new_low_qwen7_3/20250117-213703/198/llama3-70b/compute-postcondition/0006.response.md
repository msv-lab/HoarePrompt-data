The loop head condition is `b > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as `b` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `a` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a))`
- `b` is floor(`b/2`)
- `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which depends solely on the variable `b`.

Since `b` is updated in each iteration to be the floor division of itself by 2 (`b = floor(b/2)`), we need to ensure that after this update, `b` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Let's denote the value of `b` at the start of the previous iteration as `b_prev`. After the loop body (which includes updating `b` to `floor(b/2)`), `b` becomes `floor(b/2)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `floor(b/2)` must be greater than 0. This implies that `b` must have been at least 2 before the update (since the floor division of 2 by 2 is 1, and the floor division of any number less than 2 by 2 results in 0).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `b` must be at least 2 before the update.

State: **`a` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a))`, `b` must be at least 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`**
