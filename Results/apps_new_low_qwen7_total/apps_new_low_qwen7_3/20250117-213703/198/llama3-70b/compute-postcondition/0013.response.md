Output State: **a is the result of func_1(func_1(a, a), a), b is at least 1 and must be greater than 0 but halved, res remains unchanged**

Explanation:
1. The first line `a = func_1(a, a)` updates `a` to be the result of `func_1` called with `a` and `a` as arguments. This modifies `a`.
2. The second line `b >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift on `b`, effectively halving its value (since `b` is at least 1 and must be greater than 0). This modifies `b`.

The initial state is not fully specified for `a` and `res`, but the operations performed on them are described. `a` is updated based on its initial value and the function `func_1`, and `b` is halved. `res` remains unchanged as per the precondition and the given code block.
