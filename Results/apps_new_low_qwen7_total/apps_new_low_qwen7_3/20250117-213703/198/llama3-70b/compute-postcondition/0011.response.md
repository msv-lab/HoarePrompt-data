First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State
- `a` is the result of `func_1(x, x)`, where `x` is the initial value of `a`.
- `b` is at least 1 and must be greater than 0.
- `res` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))` if `b` is odd, otherwise unchanged.

### Code Snippet
```
res = func_1(res, a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Value of `res` Before the Code Execution:**
   - According to the initial state, `res` is calculated as follows:
     - First, `func_1(res, a)` is called twice and the results are passed to `func_1`.
     - Since `b` is odd (as per the initial condition), `res` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))`.

2. **Update the Value of `res`:**
   - The code snippet updates `res` to be the result of `func_1(res, a)`.

### Output State Calculation
- Since `res` was initially determined as `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))` when `b` is odd, the new value of `res` after the code execution will be `func_1(res, a)`.

Thus, the updated state of the variables is:
- `a` remains the same as its initial value, which is the result of `func_1(x, x)`.
- `b` remains the same as it was initially set.
- `res` is updated to `func_1(res, a)`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(x, x)`, `b` is at least 1 and must be greater than 0, `res` is `func_1(res, a)`**.
