Output State: **a is the return value of func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a)), b is floor(b/2), res is the return value of func_1(1, a)**

Explanation:
1. The first line `a = func_1(a, a)` updates `a` to be the return value of `func_1` called with `a` as both arguments. This means `a` now holds the result of `func_1(a, a)`.
2. The second line `b >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `b`, which is equivalent to dividing `b` by 2 and flooring the result (since `b` is a non-negative integer and greater than 0, this operation is well-defined).
3. The variable `res` remains unchanged as it is not affected by either line of code.

Given the initial conditions where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `b` greater than 0, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`, the final output state reflects the transformations applied to `a` and `b` as described above.
