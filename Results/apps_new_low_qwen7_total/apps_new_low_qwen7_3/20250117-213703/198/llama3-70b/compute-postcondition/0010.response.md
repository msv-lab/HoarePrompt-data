The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is half of its initial value (at least 1).

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` must be greater than 0. Since `b` was initially at least 1 and has been halved, for `b` to be greater than 0, it must be at least 1 after the last iteration.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(x, x)`, where `x` is the initial value of `a`, `b` is at least 1 and must be greater than 0, `res` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))` if `b` is odd, otherwise unchanged.**
