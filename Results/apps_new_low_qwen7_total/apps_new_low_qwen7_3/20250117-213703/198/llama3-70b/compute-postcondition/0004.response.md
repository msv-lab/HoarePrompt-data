Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `b` greater than 0; `res` is the return value of `func_1(1, a)`.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. The if condition is `b & 1`, which checks if `b` is odd. Regardless of whether `b` is odd or even (since there is no else part), the value of `res` will be the return value of `func_1(1, a)`. Therefore, the overall postcondition is that `res` will always be the return value of `func_1(1, a)`, and the values of `a` and `b` remain as specified in the precondition.
