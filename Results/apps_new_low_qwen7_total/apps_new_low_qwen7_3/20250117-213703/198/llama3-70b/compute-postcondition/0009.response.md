To solve this task, we need to understand the operations performed on the variables `a`, `b`, and `res` based on the given code snippet. However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so we'll assume it operates in a way that allows us to deduce the changes to the variables.

Given:
- Initial State: `a` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a))`, `b` must be at least 2, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))` if `b` is odd.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = func_1(a, a)
b >>= 1
```

Let's break down the code:

1. `a = func_1(a, a)`:
   - This line updates `a` to the result of `func_1(a, a)`.
   - Since `a` initially is the return value of `func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a))`, let's denote the initial value of `a` as `x`.
   - So, `a` is updated to `func_1(x, x)`.

2. `b >>= 1`:
   - This line performs a right shift operation on `b`, which effectively divides `b` by 2 and truncates the decimal part (if any).
   - Given that `b` must be at least 2, let's assume the initial value of `b` is 2 or greater.
   - After this operation, `b` will be halved.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can infer the following:

- If `func_1` returns a simple mathematical operation such as addition or multiplication, and `a` starts as the return value of a similar operation involving `1` and `a`, the value of `a` might double or increase depending on the nature of `func_1`.
- `b` will be halved after the operation.

Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only provide a general answer based on the operations described:

Output State: **a is the result of `func_1(x, x)`, where `x` is the initial value of `a`, b is half of its initial value (at least 1), res is unchanged from its initial state.**

However, since the problem specifies that `res` is only relevant if `b` is odd and `b` is initially at least 2, `res` remains unchanged and is not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the final state is:

Output State: **a is the result of `func_1(x, x)`, where `x` is the initial value of `a`, b is half of its initial value (at least 1), res is the return value of `func_1(func_1(res, a), func_1(res, a))` if `b` is odd, otherwise unchanged.**
