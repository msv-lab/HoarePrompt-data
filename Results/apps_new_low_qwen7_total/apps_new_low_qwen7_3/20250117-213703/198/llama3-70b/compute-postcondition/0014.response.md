Let's analyze the given loop step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
- The loop runs as long as `b > 0`.
- If `b` is odd (`b & 1` is true), then `res = func_1(res, a)`.
- Regardless of whether `b` is odd or even, `a = func_1(a, a)`.
- `b` is then right-shifted by 1 bit (`b >>= 1`), effectively dividing it by 2.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `b` will always be halved each iteration, and eventually, it will become 0. Since `b` starts as a positive integer, this process will eventually terminate.
- **Variables Changed**:
  - `a` is updated in every iteration as `a = func_1(a, a)`.
  - `res` is updated if `b` is odd, otherwise it remains unchanged.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- After the first iteration, `a` becomes `func_1(func_1(1, a), func_1(1, a))` and `b` becomes `floor(b/2)`.
- Each subsequent iteration updates `a` as `func_1(a, a)` and adjusts `b` by halving it.
- `res` remains unchanged unless `b` is odd in the current iteration.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- Let's denote the initial value of `a` as `a_initial` and `b` as `b_initial`.
- After `k` iterations, `a` will be `func_1(...func_1(a_initial, a_initial)...)` (where `func_1` is applied `k` times).
- `b` will be `b_initial // 2^k`.
- `res` will remain `1` unless there is an odd `b` that causes `res` to be updated.

### Determine Final Output State
- The loop terminates when `b` becomes 0.
- Therefore, after `log2(b_initial)` iterations, `b` will be 0.
- At this point, `a` will be `func_1(...func_1(a_initial, a_initial)...)` (applied `log2(b_initial)` times).
- `res` remains 1 because `b` never causes an update to `res` once it becomes 0.

### Final Output State
Output State: **a is `func_1(...func_1(a_initial, a_initial)...)` (applied `log2(b_initial)` times), b is 0, res is 1.**
