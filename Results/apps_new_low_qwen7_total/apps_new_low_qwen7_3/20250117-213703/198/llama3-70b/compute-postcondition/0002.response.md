Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts an integer `a` where \(1 \leq a < 998244353\). It then calls another function `func_2` with arguments `a` and `998244351`, and returns the result of this call. There are no additional operations performed within `func_3` other than making this function call. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_3` concludes is that it has returned the result of `func_2(a, 998244351)`. No further actions are taken with the input variable `a` beyond passing it to `func_2`.**

This summary includes the fact that `func_3` only calls `func_2` and returns its result, without performing any additional operations. It also notes that `a` remains unchanged and is only used as an argument in the function call.
