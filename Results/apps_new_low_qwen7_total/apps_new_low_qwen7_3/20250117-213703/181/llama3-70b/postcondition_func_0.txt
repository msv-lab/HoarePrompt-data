The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», and an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). It processes the string `s` to construct a list `ans` containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`. Specifically, it appends each alphabetic character to `ans` and includes every second character following a `'*'` symbol. If the constructed list `ans` contains exactly `k` alphabetic characters, it prints the list as a string. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.
