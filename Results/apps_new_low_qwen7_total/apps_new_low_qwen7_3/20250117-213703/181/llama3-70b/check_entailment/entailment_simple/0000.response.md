Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is an input string containing lowercase Latin letters, `*`, and `?`.
   - `k` is an integer representing the required message length.
   - `ans` is initially an empty list.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(s)` and `len(ans) < k`.
   - If `s[i]` is an alphabetic character:
     - If `s[i + 1] == '?'`, the next character (`s[i + 2]`) is appended to `ans` and `i` is incremented by 2.
     - If `s[i + 1] == '*'`, the current character (`s[i]`) is repeatedly appended to `ans` while `s[i + 1] == '*'`, and `i` is incremented by 1 each time.
     - Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, `ans` contains a sequence of up to `k` characters from `s`, with some flexibility allowed by `*` and `?`.
   - `i` is the index where the loop terminated, ensuring `ans` is at most `k` characters long.

4. **Output**:
   - If `len(ans) == k`, `ans` is printed.
   - Otherwise, "Impossible" is printed.

The provided program logic correctly handles the encryption rules and ensures that the output meets the specified conditions. The program correctly accounts for the presence of `*` and `?` and builds the output message accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is determined to be:

Correctness: **True**
