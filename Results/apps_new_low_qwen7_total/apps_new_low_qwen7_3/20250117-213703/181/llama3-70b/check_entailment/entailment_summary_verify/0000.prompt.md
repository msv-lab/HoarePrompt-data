You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.


-----Examples-----
Input
hw?ap*yn?eww*ye*ar
12

Output
happynewyear

Input
ab?a
2

Output
aa
Input
ab?a
3

Output
aba
Input
ababb
5

Output
ababb
Input
ab?a
1

Output
Impossible

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    k = int(input())
    ans = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
        if s[i].isalpha():
            ans.append(s[i])
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
                i += 2
            elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                    ans.append(s[i])
                    i += 2
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    if len(ans) == k:
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        print('Impossible')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», and an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). It processes the string `s` to construct a list `ans` containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`. Specifically, it appends each alphabetic character to `ans` and includes every second character following a `'*'` symbol. If the constructed list `ans` contains exactly `k` alphabetic characters, it prints the list as a string. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string contains multiple consecutive `*` (snowflakes) after a letter. According to the problem description, a snowflake allows the preceding letter to be removed, left, or repeated several times. However, the current implementation only handles one snowflake and does not account for the possibility of repeating the letter multiple times.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
a??b*
2
```
The expected output could be `ab` because the two `?` allow the letter `a` to be either removed or left, and the `*` allows the letter `b` to be repeated. However, the current program would not generate `ab` as a valid output because it only appends the letter once when encountering a `*`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle multiple consecutive `*` by allowing the preceding letter to be repeated until the desired length is achieved.
