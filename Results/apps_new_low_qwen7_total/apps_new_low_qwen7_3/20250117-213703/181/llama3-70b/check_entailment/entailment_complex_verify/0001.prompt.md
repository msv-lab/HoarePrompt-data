You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words "Hello, Andrey!", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.

Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.

For example, consider the following string:  [Image] 

This string can encode the message «happynewyear». For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows:   candy cane 1: remove the letter w,  snowflake 1: repeat the letter p twice,  candy cane 2: leave the letter n,  snowflake 2: remove the letter w,  snowflake 3: leave the letter e. 

 [Image] 

Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode «hayewyar», «happpppynewwwwwyear», and other messages.

Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $k$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $k$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the string received in the postcard. The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, as well as the characters «*» and «?», meaning snowflake and candy cone, respectively. These characters can only appear immediately after the letter. The length of the string does not exceed $200$.

The second line contains an integer number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 200$), the required message length.


-----Output-----

Print any message of length $k$ that the given string can encode, or «Impossible» if such a message does not exist.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior in detail.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `s` is an input string.
    #   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 200\).
    #   - `ans` is a list containing the first `k` characters of `s`.
    #   - `i` is initialized to `k`.
    #
    #2. **Loop Behavior**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(s)` and `len(ans) < k`.
    #   - Inside the loop:
    #     - If `s[i]` is an alphabetic character:
    #       - If `s[i + 1] == '?'`, append `s[i + 2]` to `ans` and increment `i` by 2.
    #       - If `s[i + 1] == '*'`, keep appending `s[i]` to `ans` while `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then increment `i` by 1.
    #       - Otherwise, simply increment `i` by 1.
    #     - If `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character, increment `i` by 1.
    #
    #3. **Invariants and Variables**:
    #   - `ans` is built by appending alphabetic characters from `s`.
    #   - `i` is incremented based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #   - `k` remains constant throughout the loop.
    #
    #4. **Final State**:
    #   - The loop terminates when `i >= len(s)` or `len(ans) == k`.
    #   - The final value of `i` will be the minimum of `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
    #   - `ans` will contain up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #
    #After the loop has executed all possible iterations, the final output state will be:
    #
    #- `s`: The input string.
    #- `k`: The initial value, which remains constant.
    #- `ans`: A list containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered multiple times.
    #- `i`: The final value of `i` will be the smallest value between `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `s`: The input string.
    #- `k`: The initial value of `k`.
    #- `ans`: A list of up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
    #- `i`: The smallest value between `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
    if (len(ans) == k) :
        print(''.join(ans))
    else :
        print('Impossible')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is the input string, `k` is the initial value, `ans` is a list of up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered, and `i` is the smallest value between `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered. If the length of `ans` is exactly `k`, then `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the message 'Impossible' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», and an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). It processes the string `s` to construct a list `ans` containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`. Specifically, it appends each alphabetic character to `ans` and includes every second character following a `'*'` symbol. If the constructed list `ans` contains exactly `k` alphabetic characters, it prints the list as a string. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and the required message length `k`.
2. **Building the Message**: 
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and builds the message `ans` character by character.
   - If the current character `s[i]` is an alphabet letter:
     - It appends the letter to `ans`.
     - If the next character is `?`, it skips the next character (i.e., moves `i` to `i+2`).
     - If the next character is `*`, it enters a loop where it repeats the current character until encountering another `*` or reaching the end of the string.
   - If the current character is not an alphabet letter, it simply skips it (i.e., moves `i` to `i+1`).
3. **Output Determination**:
   - After constructing `ans`, the program checks if the length of `ans` matches `k`.
   - If the lengths match, it prints the constructed message.
   - If the lengths do not match, it prints "Impossible".

Given these steps, let's verify the logic with some examples from the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: Input `hw?ap*yn?eww*ye*ar` with `k=12`
  - Expected Output: `happynewyear`
  - The program correctly handles the `?` and `*` characters and constructs the message.
- **Example 2**: Input `ab?a` with `k=2`
  - Expected Output: `aa`
  - The program correctly handles the `?` and constructs the message.
- **Example 3**: Input `ab?a` with `k=3`
  - Expected Output: `aba`
  - The program correctly handles the `?` and constructs the message.
- **Example 4**: Input `ababb` with `k=5`
  - Expected Output: `ababb`
  - The program correctly constructs the message without using `?` or `*`.
- **Example 5**: Input `ab?a` with `k=1`
  - Expected Output: `Impossible`
  - The program correctly determines that it's impossible to construct a message of length 1.

After verifying the logic with these examples, we can conclude that the given program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.
