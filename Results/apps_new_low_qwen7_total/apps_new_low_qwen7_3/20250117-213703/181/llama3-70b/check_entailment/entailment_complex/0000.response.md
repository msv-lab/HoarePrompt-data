Reasoning:
Let's review the logic of the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and the integer `k`.
2. **Initialization**: A list `ans` is initialized to store the characters of the message.
3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` and constructs the list `ans` by considering the rules for `*` and `?`.
   - For each alphabetic character, it checks the next character:
     - If the next character is `?`, it skips the next character (i.e., `i += 2`).
     - If the next character is `*`, it repeats the current character as many times as possible until encountering another non-`*` character (i.e., `s[i + 1] != '*'`), then increments `i` by 1.
     - If the next character is neither `*` nor `?`, it simply appends the current character to `ans` and increments `i` by 1.
   - This ensures that `ans` can potentially include more characters due to the flexibility allowed by `*`.
4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the length of `ans` equals `k`.
   - If `len(ans) == k`, it prints the constructed message (`''.join(ans)`).
   - Otherwise, it prints `Impossible`.

Given the logic, the program appears to correctly implement the decryption process according to the problem statement. However, there is one critical point to verify:

### Verification:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `s` ends with `*` or `?`.
  - The program correctly handles strings that don't allow constructing a message of length `k`.

Since the program correctly processes the string according to the rules and outputs either the constructed message or `Impossible`, we can conclude that the program is logically sound.

Correctness: **True**
