Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the execution:

### Initial State:
- `s` is an input string
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < \text{len}(s)\)
- At least one of the following conditions is true:
  - `(k + 3) < \text{len}(s)` and `s[k + 4] == '*'`
  - `(k + 1) < \text{len}(s)` and `s[k + 2] == '*'`
  - `(k + 2) < \text{len}(s)` and `s[k + 3] == '*'`

### Code Snippet:
```python
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The conditions specified ensure that either `s[k+3] == '*'`, `s[k+2] == '*'`, or `s[k+1] == '*'` holds true.
2. **Loop Behavior**: The code snippet does not indicate a loop; it appears to be part of a loop where `i` is being incremented by 2. However, without the full context, we assume this is a continuation of a loop where `i` starts at `k`.

Since the exact initial values of `i` and `ans` are not given, we'll proceed based on the logic implied by the conditions.

### Execution Flow:
- `ans.append(s[i])`: This appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`.
- `i += 2`: This increments the index `i` by 2.

### Impact on Variables:
- `ans` gets an element appended from `s` at the current index `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 2.

### Final Output State:
- `ans` will contain the character from `s` at index `i`.
- `i` will be incremented by 2.

Since the exact starting value of `i` and the content of `s` are not specified, we can only say that `ans` will contain the character at index `i` and `i` will be increased by 2.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **ans contains the character at index i from string s, i is increased by 2**
