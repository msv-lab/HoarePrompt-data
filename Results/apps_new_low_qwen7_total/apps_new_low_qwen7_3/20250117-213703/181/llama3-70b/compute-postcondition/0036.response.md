Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` has a length less than `k`, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `ans` is a list of characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i` until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true, and `i` is now `i + 1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is concatenated with the character at index `k + 3` of `s`, and `i` is increased by 1.***
