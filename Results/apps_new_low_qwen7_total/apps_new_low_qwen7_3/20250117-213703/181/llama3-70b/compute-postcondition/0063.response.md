The code `print('Impossible')` does not affect any variable values or states; it only prints a message. Therefore, the variables `s`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `k` is the initial value, `ans` is a list of up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered, and `i` is the smallest value between `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered, and the length of `ans` is less than `k`. The message 'Impossible' is printed.**
