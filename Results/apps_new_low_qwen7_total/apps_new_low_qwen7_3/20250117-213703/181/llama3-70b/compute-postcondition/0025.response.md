The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `i` was `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. After incrementing by 2, the new value of `i` will be `k + 5`, `k + 3`, or `k + 4`, respectively. The values of `s`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` has a length less than `k`, and `ans` is equal to its previous value plus the character at index `i` of `s`, where `i` is either `k + 5`, `k + 3`, or `k + 4`; `i` is increased by 2.**
