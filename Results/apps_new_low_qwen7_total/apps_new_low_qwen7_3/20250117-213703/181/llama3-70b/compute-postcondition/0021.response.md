`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is `k`, so after the increment, `i` becomes `k + 1`. The character `s[i]` is not alphabetic, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k` characters of `s`, `i` is `k + 1`, and the character `s[i]` is not alphabetic.
