The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `s[i]` is 'e'. Therefore, `ans` becomes `['a', 'c', 'e']`.

The second line `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Initially, `i` is 4, so after this operation, `i` becomes 6.

No other variables are affected by the given code block.

Output State: **s is "abcdef*", k is 3, ans is ['a', 'c', 'e'], i is 6**
