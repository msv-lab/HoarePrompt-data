Let's analyze the given loop and the provided states step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop condition is `while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'`. This means the loop continues as long as the character immediately following the current position `i` is an asterisk (`'*'`). The loop appends the character at position `i` to the list `ans` and then increments `i` by 2.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: 
  - `s` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `i` starts at `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and increases by 2 in each iteration until it no longer satisfies the loop condition.

- **Variables Updated in Each Iteration**:
  - `ans` is appended with the character at position `i` in each iteration.
  - `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
2. The character at `i + 1` is an asterisk (`'*'`).

Each iteration appends the character at `i` to `ans` and then increments `i` by 2. This means that the characters added to `ans` will be those at even positions relative to the starting point of `i`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
From the provided output states:
- After 1 execution: `s = "abcdef"`, `k = 3`, `ans = ['a', 'c']`, `i = 4`
- After 2 executions: `s = "abcdef*"`, `k = 3`, `ans = ['a', 'c', 'e']`, `i = 6`
- After 3 executions: `i = 7`, `ans = ['s']`

This suggests that the loop stops once `i` exceeds the length of the string `s` or the next character is not an asterisk.

### Final Calculation
Given the loop behavior and the provided states, we can deduce the final output state. Let's assume the loop runs until `i` exceeds the length of `s` or the next character is not an asterisk.

#### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `s = "abcdefg"` and `k = 3`.
- Initially, `i = 4` (assuming `k + 2`).
- The loop will append `s[4] = 'e'` and increment `i` to 6.
- Next, the loop will append `s[6] = 'g'` and increment `i` to 8.
- Since `i = 8` is out of bounds, the loop terminates.

Thus, the final state would be:
- `s = "abcdefg"`
- `k = 3`
- `ans = ['e', 'g']`
- `i = 8`

### Final Output State
Output State: **s = "abcdefg", k = 3, ans = ['e', 'g'], i = 8**
