Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), and `ans` is a string or a list of characters based on the following conditions:
- If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?'`, then `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i + 2` of `s` (where `i` is either `k + 5`, `k + 3`, or `k + 4`) and increasing `i` by 2.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated based on the conditions:
  - If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `ans` is a list of characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i` (where `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`) until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true, and `i` is now `i + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is updated by concatenating it with the character at index `k + 3` of `s`, and `i` is increased by 1.***
