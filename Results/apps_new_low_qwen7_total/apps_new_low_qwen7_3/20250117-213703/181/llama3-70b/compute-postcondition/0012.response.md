Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains two conditions:
   - `i + 1 < len(s)`
   - `s[i + 1] == '*'`

2. **Current States**:
   - `ans` is `[s[i]]`
   - `i` is `i + 2`

3. **Determine Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition `i + 1 < len(s)` must hold true for the loop to proceed.
   - The second condition `s[i + 1] == '*'` must also hold true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is currently `i + 2`, the value of `i` needs to be such that `i + 1` is within the bounds of `s` and `s[i + 1]` is `'*'`.
   - To ensure `i + 1 < len(s)`, `i + 2` (current value of `i`) should be such that `i + 3 < len(s)`. This means `i` should be less than `len(s) - 2`.
   - Additionally, `s[i + 1]` should be `'*'`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'` for the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` is currently `i + 2`, we need to ensure `i` is appropriately set to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

State: **`ans` is [s[i]], `i` must be such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`**
