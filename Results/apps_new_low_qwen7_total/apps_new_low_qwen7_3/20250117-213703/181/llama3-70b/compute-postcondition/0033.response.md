The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state defines `i` as the last even index where the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` was met or the next odd index if the condition was not met, incrementing `i` will move to the next index. 

Given this, the updated state for `i` is simply `i + 1`. All other variables (`ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i` until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**
