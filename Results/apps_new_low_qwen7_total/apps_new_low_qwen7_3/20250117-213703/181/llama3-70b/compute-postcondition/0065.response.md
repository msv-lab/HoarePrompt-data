The function `func` accepts two parameters: a string consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», where the string length does not exceed 200, and an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). 

Case_1: The function returns a substring of the input string starting from the first character up to the \( k \)-th character, inclusive.
Case_2: If \( k \) exceeds the length of the string, the function returns the entire input string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string and an integer \( k \), and if \( k \) is within the bounds of the string, return a substring from the start of the string up to the \( k \)-th character. If \( k \) is greater than the length of the string, it returns the entire string.
