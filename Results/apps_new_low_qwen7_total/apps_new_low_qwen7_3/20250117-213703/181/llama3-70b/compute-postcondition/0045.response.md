The provided code snippet appears to be incomplete as it references `i` which is not defined anywhere in the given code block. However, based on the initial state and the structure of the code, we can infer that `i` should be initialized before this block is executed. Let's assume that `i` is initialized to 0 before this code block is run. Given the initial state where `s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), and `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and the character at index `i + 1` in `s` must be '*', we can proceed with the following analysis.

Since the code block is:
```
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

We need to know the value of `i` to determine the character being appended to `ans`. However, since `i` is not defined in the provided snippet, let's assume that `i` is 0 initially for the sake of this example (it should be adjusted based on the actual value of `i`).

Given `i = 0`:
- `ans.append(s[0])` appends the character at index 0 of `s` to `ans`.
- `i += 2` increments `i` by 2.

Let's assume `s` is "abcdef" and `k` is 3 (a valid value for `k` since \(1 \leq k < len(s)\)).

After the first iteration:
- `ans` becomes `[s[0]]`, so `ans` is ['a'].
- `i` becomes `2`.

The next character to append would be `s[2]`, which is 'c'.

After the second iteration:
- `ans` becomes `['a', 'c']`.
- `i` becomes `4`.

No further iterations are possible since `i` would exceed the length of `s` if we try to access `s[4]` in the next iteration.

Final state:
Output State: **s is "abcdef", k is 3, ans is ['a', 'c'], i is 4**
