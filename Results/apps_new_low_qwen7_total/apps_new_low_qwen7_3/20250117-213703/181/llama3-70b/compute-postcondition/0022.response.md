Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing either the first \(k+1\) characters of `s` (depending on the value of `i + 1`), or the first \(k\) characters of `s` (if `i + 1` is out of bounds or meets certain conditions), and `i` is updated to either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. If `i + 1` is out of bounds or `s[i + 1]` is not '*', `ans` remains unchanged. If `s[i + 1] == '*'`, `ans` includes every second character starting from `i + 1` until a non-'*' character or the end of the string is reached. If `s[i + 1] == '?'`, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is set to `k + 3`.***
