`ans` appends the character at index `i` of `s`. The value of `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`, and it must be less than `len(s)`. The length of `ans` must also be less than `k` for the loop to continue executing. The value of `s` and `k` remain unchanged, and the previous value of `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`.**
