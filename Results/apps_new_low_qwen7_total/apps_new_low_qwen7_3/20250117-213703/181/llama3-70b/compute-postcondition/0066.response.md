Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, «*», and «?», and an integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 200 \). It processes the string `s` to construct a list `ans` containing up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`. Specifically, it appends each alphabetic character to `ans` and includes every second character following a `'*'` symbol. If the constructed list `ans` contains exactly `k` alphabetic characters, it prints the list as a string. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function handles the case where `k` is greater than the length of `s` by processing as many alphabetic characters as possible until `ans` contains `k` characters or `s` is exhausted.
- The function correctly processes strings containing both `'*'` and `'?'` symbols, appending characters as specified.
- The function ensures that `ans` contains no more than `k` alphabetic characters, even if `s` contains more than `k` alphabetic characters.
- If `s` is empty, the function will return an empty list `ans` and print 'Impossible' since `k` cannot be zero.

Final state after the function concludes:
- `s`: The original input string.
- `k`: The initial value of `k`.
- `ans`: A list of up to `k` alphabetic characters from `s`, possibly including every second character if `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
- `i`: The final value of `i` will be the smallest value between `len(s)` and `k + 2 * n` where `n` is the number of times `s[i + 1] == '*'` was encountered.
