Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is an input string, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, ans is a list containing the first k characters of s, i is k
Code of the loop:
while i < len(s) and len(ans) < k:
    if s[i].isalpha():
        ans.append(s[i])
        if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '?':
            i += 2
        elif i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
            while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
                ans.append(s[i])
                i += 2
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing either the first \(k+1\) characters of `s` (depending on the value of `i + 1`), or the first \(k\) characters of `s` (if `i + 1` is out of bounds or meets certain conditions), and `i` is updated to either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. If `i + 1` is out of bounds or `s[i + 1]` is not '*', `ans` remains unchanged. If `s[i + 1] == '*'`, `ans` includes every second character starting from `i + 1` until a non-'*' character or the end of the string is reached. If `s[i + 1] == '?'`, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is set to `k + 3`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters, and `i` is updated to either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. If `s[i].isalpha()`, then:
- If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?', ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i + 2` of `s` (where `i` is either `k + 5`, `k + 3`, or `k + 4`) and increasing `i` by 2.
- If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*', ans` is a list of characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i` (where `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`) until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true, and `i` is now `i + 1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by concatenating it with the character at index `k + 3` of `s`, and `i` is increased by 1.
Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and `i` is either `k + 5`, `k + 4`, `k + 3`, `k + 2`, or `k + 3` and is less than `len(s)`. If `s[i].isalpha()` is true, `ans` is updated with the alphabetic character at index `i`, and `i` is adjusted based on the following conditions: if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?'`, then `i` remains unchanged; if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then `i` is set to `i + 1`; otherwise, `i` is adjusted accordingly. If `s[i].isalpha()` is false, `ans` is updated with the non-alphabetic character at index `i`, and `i` is updated to either `k + 4`, `k + 2`, or `k + 3`.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
