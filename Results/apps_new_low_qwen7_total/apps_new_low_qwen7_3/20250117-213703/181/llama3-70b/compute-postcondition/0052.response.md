Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`. The condition `(i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*'` is false**
