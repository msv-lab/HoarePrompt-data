The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. Since the exact value of `i` before incrementing was not specified, we denote it as `i`. After incrementing, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` has a length less than `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character**
