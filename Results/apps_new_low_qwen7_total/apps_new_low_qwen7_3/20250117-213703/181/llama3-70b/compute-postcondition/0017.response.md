`i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is set to `k + 1`. Given the condition \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), the new value of `i` will be `k + 2`. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition involving `i + 1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k+1` characters of `s`, `i` is `k + 2`, and either \(i + 1 \geq len(s)\) or \(s[i + 1] \neq '*'**
