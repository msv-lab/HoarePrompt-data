The code appends the character at index `i` of `s` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is `k` and the current character at index `i` of `s` is alphabetic, `ans` will have its last element updated to the character at index `k` of `s`. The length of `ans` will now be `k + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k+1` characters of `s`, `i` is `k+1`.**
