Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions required for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `s` is an input string.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\).
- `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended.
- `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`.

The loop condition is:
```
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine what must hold true for the loop to execute the first time, we need to check both parts of the condition:

1. **Condition 1:** `i + 1 < len(s)`
   - This ensures that the index `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.

2. **Condition 2:** `s[i + 1] == '*'`
   - This checks if the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` is a star ('*').

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values of `i`:**
   - `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`.

2. **Condition 1 Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is one of the values `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`, and it is guaranteed to be less than `len(s)`, this condition will always be true as long as `k` is valid (i.e., \(1 \leq k < len(s)\)).

3. **Condition 2 Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, the character at index `i + 1` must be a star ('*'). Therefore, `s[i + 1]` must be '*'.

### Conclusion

Given that the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` is already satisfied by the initial values of `i` and the constraint on `k`, the only condition that needs to be checked is `s[i + 1] == '*'`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop must be such that:
- `s` is an input string.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\).
- `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended.
- `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`.
- The character at index `i + 1` in the string `s` must be '*'.

State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and the character at index `i + 1` in `s` must be '*'**
