Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and `i` is either `k + 4`, `k + 2`, or `k + 3` and is less than `len(s)`. If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, then the function sets `i` to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is now either `k + 4`, `k + 2`, or `k + 3` and is less than `len(s)`.***
