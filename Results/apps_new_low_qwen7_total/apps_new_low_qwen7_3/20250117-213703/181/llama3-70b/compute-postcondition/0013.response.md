Output State: **ans is [s[i], s[i+2]], i is i + 2**

Explanation:
- The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the list `ans`. At this point, `ans` contains `[s[i]]`.
- The second line `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2, making it `i + 2`.

Since the initial condition is that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, after executing the code, `ans` will contain the characters at indices `i` and `i + 2` (since `i` is incremented by 2), and `i` will be updated to `i + 2`.

Therefore, the final state is `ans is [s[i], s[i+2]]` and `i is i + 2`.
