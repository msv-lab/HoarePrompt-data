The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the precondition that `i` is either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2` and is less than `len(s)`, and the condition `(i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*')` is false, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`. The other variables remain in their initial conditions.

- If `i` was `k + 3`, it becomes `k + 4`.
- If `i` was `k + 1`, it becomes `k + 2`.
- If `i` was `k + 2`, it becomes `k + 3`.

In all cases, the new value of `i` is less than `len(s)` because the original value of `i` was already less than `len(s)` and it only increases by 1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters with one additional character appended, and `i` is now either `k + 4`, `k + 2`, or `k + 3` and is less than `len(s)`.**
