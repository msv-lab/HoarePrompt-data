The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so `i` becomes `k + 3`. The value of `i + 1` is now `k + 4`. Since the character at index `i + 1` of `s` was previously a question mark (`?`), and no code changes this character, it remains a question mark (`?`). All other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k+1` characters of `s`, `i` is `k + 3`, the character at index `i + 1` of `s` is a question mark (`?`)**
