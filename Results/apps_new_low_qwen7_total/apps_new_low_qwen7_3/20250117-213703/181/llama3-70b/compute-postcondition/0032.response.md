Let's analyze the given code and the provided initial state step by step.

### Initial State
- `s` is an input string.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < \text{len}(s)\).
- `ans` is initially an empty list (since it is said to have a length less than `k` and is equal to its previous value plus the character at index `i` of `s`, we assume it starts as an empty list).

### Code of the Loop
```python
while i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == '*':
    ans.append(s[i])
    i += 2
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - If the condition is met, `ans.append(s[i])` adds the character at index `i` of `s` to the list `ans`.
   - Then, `i += 2` increases the index `i` by 2.

### Output States After Iterations
- **After 1 iteration**: 
  - `ans` contains the character at index `i` from `s`.
  - `i` is increased by 2.
  - `s[i + 3] == '*'` must be true for the next iteration.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `ans` is a list containing two characters from `s` at indices `i` and `i + 2`.
  - `i` is increased by 2 for each iteration, so now `i` is `k + 4`.
  - `s[i + 3] == '*'` must be true for the third iteration.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `ans` is `['b', 'a']` and `i` is `3`.

### Summary of Loop Behavior
- The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
- Each iteration appends `s[i]` to `ans` and increments `i` by 2.
- The loop stops when the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer satisfied.

### Final Values
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` will contain characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i`, up until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true.
- **`i`**: The final value of `i` will be the last even index where the condition was met or the next odd index if the condition was not met.

### Conditions Under Which the Loop Executes or Does Not Execute
- The loop executes as long as there are enough characters in `s` to satisfy the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`.
- If `s[i + 1] != '*'` for any `i`, the loop will stop.

### Output State After All Executions of the Loop
Based on the provided information and the summary of the loop behavior, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`ans` is a list of characters from `s` at even indices starting from `i` until the condition `i + 1 < len(s)` or `s[i + 1] != '*'` is no longer true, and `i` is the last even index where the condition was met or the next odd index if the condition was not met.**
