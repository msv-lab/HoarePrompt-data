Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a string or a list of characters, and `i` is updated to either `k + 3`, `k + 1`, or `k + 2`. Additionally, `i` is less than `len(s)` and `len(ans)` is less than `k`, and `s[i]` is not an alphabetic character**
