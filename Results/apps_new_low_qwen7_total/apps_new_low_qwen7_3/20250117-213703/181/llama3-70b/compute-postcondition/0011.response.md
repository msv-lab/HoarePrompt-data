The provided code snippet consists of two lines. Let's analyze their impact on the variables:

1. `ans.append(s[i])`: This line appends the character at index `i` in the string `s` to the list `ans`. Before this line executes, `ans` is an empty list because it is not defined or initialized elsewhere in the given code snippet. After appending, `ans` contains the character at index `i`.
2. `i += 2`: This line increments the value of `i` by 2. The variable `i` is updated to hold a new value.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is an input string.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < \text{len}(s)\).
- `i` must be such that \(i + 1 < \text{len}(s)\) and \(s[i + 1] == '*'\).

After executing the code, we know:
- `ans` will contain the character at index `i` in `s`.
- `i` will be incremented by 2.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **ans is [s[i]], i is i + 2**
