Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k+1` characters of `s`, `i` is `k + 3`. Depending on the conditions checked in the if-else block:
- If `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '?', `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `k + 3`.
- Otherwise, if `i + 1 < len(s)` and `s[i + 1] == '*'`, `ans` is updated to include every second character starting from `i + 1` until a non-'*' character or the end of the string is reached, and `i` is set to `i + 1`.
- If neither condition is met, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `k + 2`.**
