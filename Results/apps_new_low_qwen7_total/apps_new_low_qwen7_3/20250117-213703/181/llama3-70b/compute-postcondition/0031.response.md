Initial State: `ans` is a list containing the character 'a' (i.e., `ans` is ['a']), `i` is 1, and `s[3]` is '*' (the condition for the next operation).

Code Block:
```
ans.append(s[i])
i += 2
```

Analysis:
- The first line `ans.append(s[i])` appends the character at index `i` in `s` to the list `ans`.
  - Given `i` is 1, `s[i]` is `s[1]`. If we assume `s` is a string where `s[1]` is a character, it gets appended to `ans`.
- The second line `i += 2` increments `i` by 2.

Since the precondition states `s[3]` must be '*', after appending `s[1]` to `ans`, `i` will be incremented by 2, making `i` 3. At this point, the condition for the next operation is satisfied because `s[3]` is '*', so the next iteration or line would proceed correctly.

Final State:
- `ans` now contains the character from `s[1]` followed by 'a'.
- `i` is updated to 3.

Given no additional characters or conditions are specified beyond the provided code, we can infer the following based on the given information:
- If `s[1]` is 'b', then `ans` becomes `['b', 'a']`.

Therefore, the final state is:
Output State: **ans is ['b', 'a'], i is 3** (assuming `s[1]` is 'b'). If `s[1]` is a different character, adjust accordingly.
