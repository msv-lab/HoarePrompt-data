The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `s`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` has a length less than `k`, and `ans` is equal to its previous value concatenated with the character at index `k + 3` of `s`; `i` is increased by 1.
