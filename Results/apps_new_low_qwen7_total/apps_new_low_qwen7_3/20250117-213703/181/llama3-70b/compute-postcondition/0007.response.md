Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < len(s)\), `ans` is a list containing the first `k+1` characters of `s`, `i` is `k+1`, `i + 1` is less than `len(s)` and the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is '*', and either `i + 1 \geq len(s)` or `s[i + 1] \neq '?'`**
