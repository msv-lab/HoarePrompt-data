The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over possible combinations of spending `n` on houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`. Specifically, the function will return `'NO'` only when no valid combination of spending on houses, cars, and computers leaves a remainder divisible by the cost of a computer.
