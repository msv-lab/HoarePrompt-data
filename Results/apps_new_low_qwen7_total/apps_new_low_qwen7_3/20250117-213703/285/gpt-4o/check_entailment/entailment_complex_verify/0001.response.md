### Reasoning:

1. **Program Structure and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` as its argument, and the result of this function is printed.

2. **Nested Loop Logic**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses) from `0` to `n // house_cost`.
   - For each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over possible values of `b` (number of cars) from `0` to `(n - a * house_cost) // car_cost`.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the remaining amount after buying `a` houses and `b` cars is calculated as `remaining_after_cars = n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost`.
   - The program then checks if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` using the condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:`.
   - If such a combination is found, the function immediately returns `'YES'`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The nested loops ensure that all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of computers) are checked.
   - The logic correctly handles the case where no valid combination is found by returning `'NO'` at the end of the function.
   - The input handling and output formatting match the problem requirements.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of using nested loops to check all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` is sound and ensures that all potential ways to spend `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers are considered.
   - The condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:` correctly identifies if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, indicating that Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` game-coins in this manner.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem, ensuring that all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers are checked to determine if Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` game-coins.

**Final:** True
