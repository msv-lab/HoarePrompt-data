You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

- Program:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over possible combinations of spending `n` on houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`. Specifically, the function will return `'NO'` only when no valid combination of spending on houses, cars, and computers leaves a remainder divisible by the cost of a computer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The logic is correct as it iterates through all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of houses, cars, and computers respectively) to see if they sum up to `n`. 

Here's a brief analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input `n` and initializes the costs for houses, cars, and computers.
2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`).
3. **Inner Loops**: For each value of `a`, the inner loops iterate over the possible number of cars (`b`) and check if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`c`).

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program will correctly determine if there exists a combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfies the equation \( a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \). There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to provide the correct output.
