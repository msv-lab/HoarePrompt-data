Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567

car_cost = 123456

computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is 0, 'YES' is returned.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over possible combinations of spending `n` on houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`. Specifically, the function will return `'NO'` only when no valid combination of spending on houses, cars, and computers leaves a remainder divisible by the cost of a computer.
