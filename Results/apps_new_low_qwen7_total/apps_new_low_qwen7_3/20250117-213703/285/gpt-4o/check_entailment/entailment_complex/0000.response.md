Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to check if it's possible to spend all of Kolya's initial game-coins (`n`) by buying houses, cars, and computers. The approach uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of purchasing these items until a valid combination is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

However, the program has a logical flaw in its implementation:

1. **Variable Naming Conflict**: The variable `car_cost` shadows the global variable `car_cost` defined within the `func_1` function. This is not immediately obvious from the code snippet, but it would lead to an error if the global `car_cost` was intended to be used.

2. **Algorithmic Inefficiency**: The current implementation has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is computationally expensive for large values of \(n\) (up to \(10^9\)). This inefficiency is not ideal for a problem with such a wide range of potential input values.

Despite these issues, the logic for determining whether it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using houses, cars, and computers is fundamentally sound. The solution checks every possible combination of purchases, ensuring that no valid combination is missed.

However, since the main concern is correctness based on the logic rather than performance, we need to verify if the logic correctly identifies valid combinations without missing any. Given that the logic iterates through all possible combinations and checks the condition correctly, it does identify valid cases properly.

Therefore, the core logic is correct, and the provided solution should work correctly for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
