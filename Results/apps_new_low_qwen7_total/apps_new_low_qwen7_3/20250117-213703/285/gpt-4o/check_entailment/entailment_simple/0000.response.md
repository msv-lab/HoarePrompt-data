### Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to determine if Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. The approach used is a brute-force method to check all possible combinations of these items to see if any combination sums up to `n`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the initial number of game-coins `n` from the input.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
   - It uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible numbers of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) that can be bought with the available budget.
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining budget after buying `a` houses and `b` cars.
   - If the remaining budget is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer, it means Kolya could have spent all his coins.
   - If no such combination is found, it returns "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the budget after buying houses and cars cannot be exactly met by buying computers.
   - The loops ensure that all combinations within the possible range are checked.

4. **Return Statements**:
   - The function returns "YES" as soon as it finds a valid combination.
   - If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it returns "NO".

Given the logic and the structure of the program, it correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
