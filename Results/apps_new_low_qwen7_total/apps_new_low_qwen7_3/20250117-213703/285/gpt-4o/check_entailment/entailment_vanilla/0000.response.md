Reasoning:

1. The provided program aims to check if Kolya could have spent all his initial `n` game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers.
2. The program uses a nested loop approach to iterate through possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (the number of houses, cars, and computers respectively).
3. For each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it checks if the total cost matches `n`.
4. The logic in the nested loops correctly calculates the remaining amount after purchasing houses and cars, and then checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer.
5. If such a combination is found, the function returns "YES". If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns "NO".
6. The costs of the items (house, car, and computer) are correctly initialized in the `func_1` function.
7. The input handling and output formatting match the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
