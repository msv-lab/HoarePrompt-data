Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `b`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `car_cost`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `a` is 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
   - `n` is at most 0 (this does not directly affect the loop condition, but we should consider it).
   - `house_cost` is positive (this affects the initial value of `remaining_after_houses`).
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`, which means `remaining_after_houses` is negative because `n` is at most 0 and `house_cost` is positive.

4. **Determine the Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute at all, `remaining_after_houses` must be non-negative because the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` would result in an integer division, and the loop only executes when this value is non-negative.
   - Given `n` is at most 0 and `house_cost` is positive, the only way for `remaining_after_houses` to be non-negative is if `n` is exactly 0 (because if `n` were negative, `remaining_after_houses` would be negative).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be exactly 0, making `remaining_after_houses` equal to 0. In this case, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` would be 0, and the loop would execute once (since `b` starts from 0 and goes up to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` inclusive).

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect these conditions:

State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be exactly 0, `house_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_houses` is 0**
