The code updates `remaining_after_cars` to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. However, the value of `b` is not specified in the initial state, and neither is the exact value of `car_cost` or `remaining_after_houses`. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `remaining_after_cars`, which is now updated according to the formula given.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `n` is 0, `house_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
