To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's follow the given steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to check if there is any combination where `n` can be fully spent on houses, cars, and computers without leaving any remainder. 

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**: `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain constant.
- **Variables that Change**: `a`, `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, `remaining_after_cars`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
The loop checks for combinations of `a` and `b` such that:
- \( n - a \cdot \text{house\_cost} \geq 0 \)
- \( n - a \cdot \text{house\_cost} - b \cdot \text{car\_cost} \geq 0 \)
- The remaining amount should be exactly divisible by `computer_cost`.

The loop returns `'YES'` as soon as it finds a valid combination. If no valid combination is found, it will not return anything, meaning the loop will not terminate early.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- The loop starts with \( a = 0 \) and increases until \( a \leq \frac{n}{\text{house\_cost}} \).
- For each value of `a`, it checks possible values of `b` starting from 0 up to \( \left\lfloor \frac{\text{remaining\_after\_houses}}{\text{car\_cost}} \right\rfloor \).

### Final Output State
If the loop returns `'YES'`, it means there exists a combination of `a` and `b` such that the remaining amount is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`. In this case, the final value of `n` will be reduced to 0 because the loop will find a valid combination and stop.

If the loop does not return anything, it means no valid combination was found, and `n` remains unchanged.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be:

Output State: **n is 0, 'YES' is returned.**
