Postcondition: ***`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is -`car_cost`, `b` is 1. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no change occurs and the function continues with the current values of the variables.***
