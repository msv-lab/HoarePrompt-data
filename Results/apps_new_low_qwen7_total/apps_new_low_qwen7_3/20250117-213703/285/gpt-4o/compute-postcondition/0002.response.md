The code `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost` calculates the remaining value after subtracting `a * house_cost` from `n`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `house_cost`. Therefore, we can only express `remaining_after_houses` in terms of `n` and `a`.

- `n` is at least 1234567.
- `a` is 0.

Given `a` is 0, the expression simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n - 0 * house_cost`, which further simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`.**
