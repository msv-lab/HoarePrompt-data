Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over possible combinations of spending `n` on houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer. If such a combination is found, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`. Specifically, the function will return `'NO'` only when no valid combination of spending on houses, cars, and computers leaves a remainder divisible by the cost of a computer.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by `house_cost`, `car_cost`, or `computer_cost` without considering other combinations.
- The function does not have a specific check to return `'NO'` if `n` is less than the cost of a single house, car, or computer since these cases would naturally fall into the `'NO'` category due to the loop structure.
- The function assumes that the costs (`house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`) remain constant throughout the execution, which is true based on the given code. However, the costs could potentially be variables, which should be considered in a more general context.
