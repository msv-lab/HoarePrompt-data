Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is 0
- `n` is at most 0
- `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0
- `car_cost` is positive
- `remaining_after_cars` is -`car_cost`
- `b` is 1

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Loop Variable (`b`)**: The loop variable `b` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

### Current State of Variables:
- `b` is currently 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented to 2.
- Therefore, `b` should be set to 2.

### Other Variables:
- The other variables (`a`, `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

### Updated States:
- `a` remains 0
- `n` remains at most 0
- `remaining_after_houses` remains exactly 0
- `car_cost` remains positive
- `remaining_after_cars` remains -`car_cost`
- `b` is updated to 2

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is -`car_cost`, `b` is 2**
