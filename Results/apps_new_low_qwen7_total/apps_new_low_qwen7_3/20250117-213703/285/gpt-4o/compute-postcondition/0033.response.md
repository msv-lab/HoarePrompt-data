Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `a` as the variable iterating over `range(n // house_cost + 1)`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `a`, `n`, and `house_cost`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `a` is within the range specified by `range(n // house_cost + 1)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is 0
   - `n` is at most 0
   - `remaining_after_houses` is 0
   - `car_cost` is positive
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost` or equals 0 (when `b` reaches `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `a` is currently 0, the next value it should take for the loop to execute again is 1.
   - For `a` to become 1, `n` must still be at most 0, and `house_cost` does not change within the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - `a` becomes 1
   - `n` remains at most 0
   - `house_cost` remains positive

Given these adjustments, the new state is:

State: **`a` is 1, `n` is at most 0, `house_cost` is positive**
