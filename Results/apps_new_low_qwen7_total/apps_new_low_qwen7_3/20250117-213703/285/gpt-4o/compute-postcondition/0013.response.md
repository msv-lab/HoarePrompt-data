`b` and `car_cost` are not defined in the initial state, but the code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` indicates that `remaining_after_cars` is updated based on `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. Since `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, the equation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = n - b * car_cost`. However, without specific values for `b` and `car_cost`, we can only express `remaining_after_cars` in terms of `n`, `b`, and `car_cost`.

The output state will include the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` and keep the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * car_cost`**
