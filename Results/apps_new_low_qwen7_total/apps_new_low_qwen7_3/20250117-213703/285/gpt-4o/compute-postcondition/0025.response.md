`remaining_after_houses` is set to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0 and `b` is 1, the equation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = 0 - 1 * car_cost`, which means `remaining_after_cars` is now `-car_cost`. The value of `car_cost` is positive, so `remaining_after_cars` is a negative value equal to `-car_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is -`car_cost`, `b` is 1**
