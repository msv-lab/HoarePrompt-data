The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns 'YES' in cases 1 through 9 and 'NO' in case 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return 'YES' unless `n` is specifically in a condition that results in 'NO'.
