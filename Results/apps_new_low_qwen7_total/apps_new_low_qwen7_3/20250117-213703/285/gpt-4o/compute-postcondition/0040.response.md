Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `b` in the range expression `range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `a` is 1
   - `n` must be exactly 0
   - `house_cost` is positive
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `- b * car_cost`
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged: `a` is still 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged: `n` must still be exactly 0.
   - `house_cost` remains unchanged: `house_cost` is still positive.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is updated based on the new value of `b`: Since `remaining_after_cars` is `- b * car_cost` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b + 1`. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` becomes `- (b + 1) * car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` should still be not divisible by `computer_cost`: This condition remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be exactly 0, `house_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is `- (b + 1) * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`**
