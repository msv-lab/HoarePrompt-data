`remaining_after_houses` is 0, so `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, which simplifies to `-car_cost - 2 * car_cost` because `b` is 2. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` is now `-3 * car_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is `-3 * car_cost`, `b` is 2.
Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is exactly 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is `-3 * car_cost`, `b` is 2**
