Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, `car_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost` or equals 0 (when `b` reaches `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`).**

### Analysis Breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is 0
   - `n` is at most 0
   - `remaining_after_houses` is at most 0
   - `car_cost` is a positive integer
   - `computer_cost` is a positive integer

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - The loop variable `b` starts from 0 and increments until `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is updated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are remaining houses (`remaining_after_houses > 0`) and `b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - After each iteration, `b` increases by 1, and `remaining_after_houses` decreases by `car_cost`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The loop will continue executing as long as `remaining_after_houses > 0` and `b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - When `b` reaches `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, the loop exits.
   - At this point, `remaining_after_cars` will be either `0` (if `b` has reached the exact number of cars that can be bought) or a negative value that is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

5. **Verification**:
   - If `remaining_after_houses` is exactly divisible by `car_cost` and the remainder when `remaining_after_cars` is divided by `computer_cost` is 0, the function returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, the function returns nothing, indicating that the condition was not met, and `remaining_after_cars` will be non-positive and not divisible by `computer_cost`.

Thus, after the loop finishes, `remaining_after_houses` will be 0, `car_cost` remains unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` will be either 0 or a negative value, and `a` and `n` remain their initial states.
