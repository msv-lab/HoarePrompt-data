Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `b` and the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is at least 1234567.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

4. **Update Variables for Next Iteration**:
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `remaining_after_cars` needs to be updated based on the current value of `b` plus one.

5. **Calculate New Value of `b`**:
   - Since the loop increments `b` by 1 each time, if the loop just completed its previous iteration with `b` having some value, then for the next iteration, `b` will be that value plus 1.

6. **Ensure `remaining_after_cars` is Updated Correctly**:
   - For the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1, so `remaining_after_cars` will be recalculated as `n - (b + 1) * car_cost`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` remains 0.
- `n` remains at least 1234567.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains `n`.
- `remaining_after_cars` will be `n - (b + 1) * car_cost` where `b` was the value from the previous iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - (previous_b + 1) * car_cost`**.

However, since we need a concrete example, let's assume `b` was 100 from the previous iteration (this is an arbitrary choice for illustration):

State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 101 * car_cost`**.

In a general form without specific values for `b`:

State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - (b + 1) * car_cost`**.
