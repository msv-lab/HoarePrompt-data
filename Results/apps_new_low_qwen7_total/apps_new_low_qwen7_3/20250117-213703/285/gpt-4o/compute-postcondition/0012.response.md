Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 0
   - `n` is at least 1234567
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n`
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `n - (b + 1) * car_cost - b * car_cost`

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable is `b`.
   - The loop runs from `b = 0` to `b = remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `b`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is determined at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is calculated based on `b` and changes as `b` increases.

5. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is at its maximum value, which is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be set to the next value, which would be `0` if the loop were to restart.

Given the above analysis, let's determine the states for the start of the next iteration:

- `a` remains unchanged at 0.
- `n` remains unchanged at least 1234567.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged at `n`.
- `remaining_after_cars` needs to be recalculated for `b = 0`, which would be `n` since `(b + 1) * car_cost + b * car_cost = 0 * car_cost + 0 * car_cost = 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n`**
