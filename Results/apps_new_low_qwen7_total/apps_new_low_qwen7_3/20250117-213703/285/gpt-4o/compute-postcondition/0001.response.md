Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head defines the variable `a`.
   - The loop runs for each value of `a` in the range from `0` to `n // house_cost`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `a in range(n // house_cost + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // house_cost`.

3. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be `0` because the range function starts at `0` by default.

4. **Ensure the Range Condition is Met:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n // house_cost` must be at least `0`.
   - Since `n` is an integer between `1` and \(10^9\), and `house_cost` is `1234567`, we need to check if `n` is at least `house_cost` to make sure `n // house_cost` is at least `1`.

5. **Initial Values of Variables:**
   - We don't need to adjust the values of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` as they are constants.
   - The initial value of `a` should be `0`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least `house_cost` (which is `1234567`), and `a` must be `0`.

### Final State:

State: **`n` must be at least 1234567, `a` is 0**
