Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `a` is 0
- `n` is at most 0
- `remaining_after_houses` is 0

### Loop Statement
```python
for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `a` from 0 up to (but not including) `n // house_cost + 1`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `a` is currently 0.
   - `n` is at most 0.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is 0 (though it's not directly involved in the loop condition).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` needs to be incremented from its current value.
   - Given `a` is currently 0, the next value `a` can take is 1.
   - However, the loop will only execute if `a < n // house_cost + 1`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Since `n` is at most 0, `n // house_cost` is also 0 or negative.
   - Therefore, `n // house_cost + 1` is 1 or less (since adding 1 to 0 or any negative number results in 1 or less).
   - This means the loop will only execute once (when `a = 0`) because `a` cannot be greater than 1 (which would require `n` to be positive, but it is at most 0).

### Conclusion
Since the loop can only execute once (with `a = 0`), and there are no conditions under which it would execute again given the current state, the loop does not need to be modified further for another iteration.

### Final State
- `a` remains 0.
- `n` remains at most 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains 0.

Thus, the state does not change for the next iteration because the loop does not execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is 0**
