The code assigns the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` to `remaining_after_cars`. Given the initial state, `remaining_after_houses` is 0, and `b` and `car_cost` are unspecified but we know they are variables. Therefore, the value of `remaining_after_cars` will be `- b * car_cost` since `0 - b * car_cost = - b * car_cost`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `house_cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be exactly 0, `house_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_cars` is - b * car_cost**
