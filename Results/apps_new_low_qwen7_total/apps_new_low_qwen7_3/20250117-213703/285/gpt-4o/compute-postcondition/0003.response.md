Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `b` is derived from `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`.
   - The loop condition checks if `b` is less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is at least 1234567.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, meaning `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be able to take the value 0 initially.

4. **Initial Values for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `b` starts from 0, the loop will execute if `0 < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is true.
   - This means `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be at least 1.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Condition:**
   - To satisfy `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1 >= 1`, we need to ensure `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 0.
   - Given `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567, we need to ensure `car_cost` is such that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is non-negative.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The key variables are `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is already set to `n` which is at least 1234567.
   - We need `car_cost` to be a positive value (since division by zero or negative values would make the loop condition invalid).

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute the first time is:
- `n` is at least 1234567.
- `a` is 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, ensuring it is at least 1234567.
- `car_cost` is a positive value.

State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `car_cost` must be a positive value**
