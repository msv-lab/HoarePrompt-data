`remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. Given that `a` is 1 and `n` is at most 0, the value of `remaining_after_houses` will be `n - 1 * house_cost`, which simplifies to `n - house_cost`. Since `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` will be at most `-house_cost`, but we only know the exact relationship between `remaining_after_houses`, `n`, and `house_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `n` is at most 0, `house_cost` is positive, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`**
