Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, house_cost is 1234567, car_cost is 123456, computer_cost is 1234**

Explanation: The provided code block does not include any lines that modify the value of `n` or perform any operations that would change the values of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, or `computer_cost`. Therefore, these values remain as initially defined, and `n` retains its original integer value within the specified range.
