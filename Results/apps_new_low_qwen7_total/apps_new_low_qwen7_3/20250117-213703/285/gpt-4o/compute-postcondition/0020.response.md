The code assigns `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` to `remaining_after_cars`. Given that `b` is not defined in the initial state and no default value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `remaining_after_cars`. However, since `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0 and `car_cost` must be positive, the expression simplifies to `0 - b * car_cost`, which is `-b * car_cost`.

Since `b` is not specified, we cannot provide a concrete value for `remaining_after_cars`. But we know it is `-b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0, `car_cost` must be positive, `remaining_after_cars` is `-b * car_cost`**
