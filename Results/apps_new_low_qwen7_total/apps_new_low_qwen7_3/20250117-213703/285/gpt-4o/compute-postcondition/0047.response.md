Postcondition: ***`a` is 1, `n` is 0, `house_cost` is positive, and `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken and the original state is maintained.***
