Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `b`.
   - Other variables mentioned are `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 0 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `n` is at most 0 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0 (not relevant for this loop).
   - `car_cost` must be positive (not relevant for this loop).
   - `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost` (not relevant for this loop).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `b` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The condition `b <= remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Determine the New Values:**
   - Since `b` was used in the previous iteration, it must be adjusted to `b + 1`.
   - `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars`, and `computer_cost` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0, `car_cost` must be positive, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`, `b` is 1.**

However, since the original state does not provide a specific value for `b` (it's implicitly defined by the loop condition), we can only adjust the loop-related variables.

Final Answer:
State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be exactly 0, `car_cost` must be positive, `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`, `b` is 1**.
