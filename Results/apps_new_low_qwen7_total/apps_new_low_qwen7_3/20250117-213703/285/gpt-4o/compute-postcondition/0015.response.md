Postcondition: ***`a` is 0, `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` is `n`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not change any variables' values and retains the same state as before the if-else block.***
