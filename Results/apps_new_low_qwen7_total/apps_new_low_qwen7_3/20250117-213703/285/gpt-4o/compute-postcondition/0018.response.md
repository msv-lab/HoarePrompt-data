The code updates the value of `remaining_after_houses` to `n - a * house_cost`. Given the initial state where `a` is 0 and `n` is at most 0, we can substitute these values into the equation:

- `a` is 0, so `a * house_cost` is 0.
- `n` is at most 0, so the expression `n - a * house_cost` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is just `n`.

Therefore, `remaining_after_houses` is set to `n`. Since `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is also at most 0.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is at most 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at most 0**
