Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the maximum number of non-overlapping "VK" substrings in a given string `s` consisting only of "V" and "K" by making at most one swap. The approach taken is to:

1. Count the initial number of "VK" substrings.
2. Iterate through each character in the string and consider the effect of changing it to the opposite character ("V" to "K" or "K" to "V").
3. Recalculate the number of "VK" substrings for each possible change and keep track of the maximum count.

This approach correctly addresses the problem by considering all possible single-character changes and determining their impact on the number of "VK" substrings. The logic for counting "VK" substrings and calculating the maximum count after potential swaps is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the execution summary matches the expected behavior and the implemented logic, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
