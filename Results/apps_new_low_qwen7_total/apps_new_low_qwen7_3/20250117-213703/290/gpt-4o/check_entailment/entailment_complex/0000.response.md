Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-overlapping "VK" substrings after potentially changing at most one character.
2. The first part of the program counts the number of "VK" substrings in the original string.
3. The next part of the program tries to replace each "V" or "K" with the other letter and checks if the number of "VK" substrings increases. This is done by creating a new string `s_new` for each replacement and counting the "VK" substrings in the new string.
4. The program keeps track of the maximum number of "VK" substrings found either in the original string or after any possible single-character change.
5. The logic is sound and covers all edge cases, including strings without "VK", strings with all "V"s or all "K"s, and strings with multiple "VK" substrings.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program is correct in its implementation.

Correctness: **True**
