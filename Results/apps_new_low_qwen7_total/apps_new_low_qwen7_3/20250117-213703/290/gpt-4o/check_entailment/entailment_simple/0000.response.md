### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Counting Initial VK Occurrences:**
   - The program correctly counts the initial number of "VK" substrings in the input string `s`.

2. **Single Character Modification:**
   - The program attempts to modify each character in the string `s` and checks the resulting string for "VK" substrings.
     - If the current character is 'V', it changes it to 'K'.
     - If the current character is 'K', it changes it to 'V'.
     - It skips any other characters (though this should never happen since the string consists only of 'V' and 'K').

3. **Counting New VK Occurrences After Modification:**
   - For each modified string, the program counts the number of "VK" substrings and updates `max_vk` if the new count is higher.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the maximum number of "VK" substrings found.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the steps taken ensure that all possible single modifications are considered, and the maximum number of "VK" substrings is correctly computed.

### Conclusion:

- The program correctly handles all edge cases, including strings with no initial "VK" substrings, strings with all 'V's or all 'K's, and strings with multiple "VK" substrings.
- The logic for modifying a single character and counting "VK" substrings is sound and comprehensive.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.
