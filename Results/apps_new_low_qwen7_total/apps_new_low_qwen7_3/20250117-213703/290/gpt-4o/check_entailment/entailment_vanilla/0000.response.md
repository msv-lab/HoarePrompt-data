Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly identifies the initial count of "VK" substrings in the input string.
2. It then attempts to check all possible strings obtained by changing one character (either 'V' to 'K' or 'K' to 'V') and calculates the count of "VK" substrings for each modified string.
3. The maximum count of "VK" substrings found among the original and modified strings is printed as the result.
4. The logic to change one character and compute the new count of "VK" substrings is correct.
5. The program handles the constraints (input length between 1 and 100) appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program should work as intended for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
