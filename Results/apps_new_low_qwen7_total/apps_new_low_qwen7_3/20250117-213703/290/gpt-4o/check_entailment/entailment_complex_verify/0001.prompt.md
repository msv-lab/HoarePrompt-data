You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Tonio has a keyboard with only two letters, "V" and "K".

One day, he has typed out a string s with only these two letters. He really likes it when the string "VK" appears, so he wishes to change at most one letter in the string (or do no changes) to maximize the number of occurrences of that string. Compute the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring (i. e. a letter "K" right after a letter "V") in the resulting string.


-----Input-----

The first line will contain a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with length not less than 1 and not greater than 100.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer, the maximum number of times "VK" can appear as a substring of the given string after changing at most one character.


-----Examples-----
Input
VK

Output
1

Input
VV

Output
1

Input
V

Output
0

Input
VKKKKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK

Output
3

Input
KVKV

Output
1



-----Note-----

For the first case, we do not change any letters. "VK" appears once, which is the maximum number of times it could appear.

For the second case, we can change the second character from a "V" to a "K". This will give us the string "VK". This has one occurrence of the string "VK" as a substring.

For the fourth case, we can change the fourth character from a "K" to a "V". This will give us the string "VKKVKKKKKKVVVVVVVVVK". This has three occurrences of the string "VK" as a substring. We can check no other moves can give us strictly more occurrences.

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    count_vk = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K':
            count_vk += 1
    max_vk = count_vk
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'V':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]
        elif s[i] == 'K':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
        else:
            continue
        new_count_vk = 0
        for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
            if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':
                new_count_vk += 1
        max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)
    print(max_vk)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string s consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func():
    s = input()

count_vk = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i] == 'V' and s[i + 1] == 'K':
            count_vk += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The string `s` can be any valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, and `i` is `len(s) - 2` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `i` is 0.
    max_vk = count_vk
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'V':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'K' + s[i + 1:]
        elif s[i] == 'K':
            s_new = s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]
        else:
            continue
        
        new_count_vk = 0
        
        for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):
            if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':
                new_count_vk += 1
        
        max_vk = max(max_vk, new_count_vk)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the initial `count_vk` and all `new_count_vk` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, and `s_new` remains unchanged after all iterations.
    print(max_vk)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. It calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping "VK" substrings that can be achieved by swapping any "V" with a "K" or vice versa in the given string. After processing, it prints the maximum count of such substrings. Edge cases include strings without "VK", where the maximum count will be 0. If the string consists entirely of "V"s or "K"s, the maximum count will also be 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly identifies the initial count of "VK" substrings in the input string.
2. It then attempts to check all possible strings obtained by changing one character (either 'V' to 'K' or 'K' to 'V') and calculates the count of "VK" substrings for each modified string.
3. The maximum count of "VK" substrings found among the original and modified strings is printed as the result.
4. The logic to change one character and compute the new count of "VK" substrings is correct.
5. The program handles the constraints (input length between 1 and 100) appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program should work as intended for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
