Postcondition: ***`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, and `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1 if `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'. `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, and `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`.***
