To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `count_vk` is initially set to 0.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(s) - 1):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Range:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices from 0 to `len(s) - 2` (since `range(len(s) - 1)` generates values from 0 up to `len(s) - 2`).
   - Therefore, the loop will execute the first time when `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is based on the range `range(len(s) - 1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - Before the loop starts, `s` is a valid string of length between 1 and 100.
   - `count_vk` is initially set to 0 (this variable is not directly relevant to the loop execution but may be modified inside the loop).

4. **Ensuring the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that the range condition is met, i.e., `len(s) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Minimum Length of String `s`:**
   - The minimum length of `s` is 1. In this case, `len(s) - 1` would be 0, and the range would be empty, causing the loop not to execute at all.
   - Therefore, `s` must have a length of at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must have a length of at least 2, ensuring that `len(s) - 1` is at least 1, and `i` will be 0 during the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `count_vk` is 0, `i` is 0**
