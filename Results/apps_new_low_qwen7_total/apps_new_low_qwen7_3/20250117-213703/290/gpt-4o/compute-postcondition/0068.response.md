Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original count_vk and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2.***

Explanation:
- If the condition `s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` is true, then `new_count_vk` becomes either 1 or 2, and `max_vk` remains as the maximum value between the original `count_vk` and 0.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly applies to the overall postcondition of the if-else block.
