`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `new_count_vk` was incremented, but the exact previous value is not specified. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk + 1`, `new_count_vk` is `new_count_vk + 1`, and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk + 1`, `new_count_vk` is `new_count_vk + 1`, and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`**
