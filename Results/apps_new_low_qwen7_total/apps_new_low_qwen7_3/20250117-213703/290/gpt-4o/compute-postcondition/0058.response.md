The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code, the variables `i`, `j`, `new_count_vk`, `max_vk`, and `s_new` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K' for all `j` in the range `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk` (updated to be the maximum of its original value and `new_count_vk`), and `s_new` remains unchanged.**
