`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `0` to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 1, `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'**
