Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `len(s_new)`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `len(s_new)` must be at least 2.
   - `s` is a valid string.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is 2 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`. Otherwise, `new_count_vk` remains 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(s_new) - 1`. Therefore, `len(s_new)` must still be at least 3 (since `j` was 1, and `len(s_new) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `len(s_new)` must be at least 3.
   - The states of `s`, `max_vk`, and `new_count_vk` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is 2, `len(s_new)` must be at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is 2 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`. Otherwise, `new_count_vk` remains 1.**
