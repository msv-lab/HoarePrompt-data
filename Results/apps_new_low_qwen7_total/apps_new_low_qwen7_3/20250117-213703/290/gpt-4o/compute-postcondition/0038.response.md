`s_new` is assigned the value of `s[:i] + 'V' + s[i + 1:]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so this means that `s_new` will be the first character of `s` (excluding the first character), followed by 'V', and then the rest of `s` starting from the second character.

Let's denote the initial string as `s` and its length as `len(s)`. The new string `s_new` will be constructed as follows:
- The first character of `s_new` will be the first character of `s`.
- The next character will be 'V'.
- The remaining characters will be the rest of `s` starting from the second character.

Since the length of `s_new` must be greater than 1, the original string `s` must have at least 2 characters. The value of `i` is 1, which does not change during the assignment, so `i` remains 1.

The counts of "VK" in `s` and `s_new` (`count_vk` and `new_count_vk`) are not directly affected by this operation, but the new string `s_new` is created based on the old string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 1, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of "VK" in `s_new`, and `s_new` is the first character of `s` followed by 'V' and then the rest of `s` starting from the second character.**
