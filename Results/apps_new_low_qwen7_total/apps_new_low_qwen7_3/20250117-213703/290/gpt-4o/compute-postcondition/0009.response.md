`count_vk` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count_vk` is either 1 or 2. Since the increment is by 1, the possible new values for `count_vk` are 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `count_vk` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `count_vk` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 1**
