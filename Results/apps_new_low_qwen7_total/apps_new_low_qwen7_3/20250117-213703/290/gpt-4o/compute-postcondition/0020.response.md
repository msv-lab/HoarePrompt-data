The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration without terminating the loop itself. Given that there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the behavior of `continue` here is to simply skip any further execution of the current line. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`, and `s[i]` is not equal to 'K'**
