Postcondition: ***`s` is a valid string, `i` is 1, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, and `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of "VK" in `s_new`. If the current character `s[i]` is 'V', then `s_new` is formed by appending 'K' to the first character of `s` and the rest of `s` starting from the third character. If `s[i]` is 'K', then `s_new` is formed by taking the first character of `s`, adding 'V', and then the rest of `s` starting from the second character. Otherwise, `s_new` remains unchanged as per the else part condition.***
