The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will simply be executed and no changes will be made to the variables.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 1, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of "VK" in `s_new` during the loop, and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1**
