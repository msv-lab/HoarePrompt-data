Postcondition: ***`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 1, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, and `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of "VK" in `s_new`. If the current character `s[i]` is 'K', `s_new` is formed by taking the first character of `s`, adding 'V', and then the rest of `s` starting from the second character. Otherwise, `s_new` maintains the structure defined in the else part where it must have more than one character and `new_count_vk` is updated accordingly.***
