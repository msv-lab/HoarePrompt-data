Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined by `for j in range(len(s_new) - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a valid string.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1 if `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'.
   - `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(len(s_new) - 1)`, the value of `j` will be decremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `len(s_new) - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted based on the loop head is `j`.
   - `j` must be set to `len(s_new) - 2`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - All other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1 if `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K', `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, and `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`.**
