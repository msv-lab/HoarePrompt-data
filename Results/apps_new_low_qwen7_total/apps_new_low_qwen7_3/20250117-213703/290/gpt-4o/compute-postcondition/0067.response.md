`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0, the value of `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`, `new_count_vk` is either 0 or 1, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original count_vk and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2. The output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original count_vk and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`, `new_count_vk` is either 1 or 2, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original count_vk and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2.**
