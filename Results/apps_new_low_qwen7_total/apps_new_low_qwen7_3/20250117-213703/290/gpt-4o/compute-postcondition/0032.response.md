`new_count_vk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `new_count_vk` was incremented based on the condition that `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'. Since the code only increments `new_count_vk` without any conditions, it simply adds 1 to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk + 1`, `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1, `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, and `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`.**
