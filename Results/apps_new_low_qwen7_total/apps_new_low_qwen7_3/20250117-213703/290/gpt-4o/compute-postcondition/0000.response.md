The initial state is that the input `s` is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. The variable `count_vk` is initialized to 0.

The provided code snippet reads the string `s` from the input and initializes `count_vk` to 0. However, the code does not contain any further instructions that modify `s` or `count_vk`.

Since no operations are performed on `s` or `count_vk` within the given code block, the values remain as initially set.

Output State: **s is a string consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive, count_vk is 0**
