Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `new_count_vk` is the total number of occurrences where `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K' for all `j` in the range `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, and `s_new` remains unchanged. If `s[i] == 'K'`, then `s_new` starts with 'V' followed by the rest of `s_original` starting from index 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `s_new`.***
