The code assigns the value of `count_vk` to `max_vk`. This means `max_vk` is now equal to `count_vk`, and there are no changes to the value of `i` or the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` can be any valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is `len(s) - 2` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `i` is 0; `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`**
