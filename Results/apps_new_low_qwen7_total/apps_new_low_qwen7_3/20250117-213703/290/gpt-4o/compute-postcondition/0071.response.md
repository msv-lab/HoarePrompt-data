Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `new_count_vk` is either 2 or 3, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original count_vk and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2. This is because if `s_new[j] == 'V'` and `s_new[j + 1] == 'K'` are true, then `new_count_vk` becomes either 2 or 3. If the condition is false, `new_count_vk` remains as either 1 or 2, but the other conditions stay unchanged.**
