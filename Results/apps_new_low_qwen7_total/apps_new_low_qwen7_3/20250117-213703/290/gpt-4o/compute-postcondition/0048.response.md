The code snippet `new_count_vk += 1` increments the value of `new_count_vk` by 1. From the initial state, `new_count_vk` is 1 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`. After executing the code, `new_count_vk` will be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `j` remains 1.
- `len(s_new)` remains at least 2.
- `s` remains a valid string.
- `max_vk` remains the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.
- `new_count_vk` is updated to 2 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `len(s_new)` must be at least 2, `s` is a valid string, `max_vk` is the maximum value between `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, and `new_count_vk` is 2 if `s_new[1] == 'V' and s_new[2] == 'K'`.**
