Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is -1, `new_count_vk` is the total number of consecutive 'VK' pairs found in `s_new`, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original `count_vk` and 0, and `s_new` is a valid string with a length of at least 2.

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `s_new` with `j` ranging from `len(s_new) - 1` down to 0.
   - The condition `if s_new[j] == 'V' and s_new[j + 1] == 'K':` checks for consecutive 'VK' pairs.
   - For each such pair, `new_count_vk` is incremented.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` remains constant at 0 throughout the loop.
   - `j` starts at `len(s_new) - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.
   - `new_count_vk` increases by 1 each time the condition is met.
   - `max_vk` is not changed within the loop but is initialized to the maximum of the original `count_vk` and 0 before the loop starts.
   - `s_new` is assumed to be a valid string of at least length 2, as the loop depends on this structure.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute `len(s_new) - 1` times, checking for 'VK' pairs.
   - After the loop, `j` will be -1 because the loop increments `j` in a decreasing manner until it goes out of bounds.
   - `new_count_vk` will be the total number of 'VK' pairs found in `s_new`.
   - `max_vk` remains as the maximum of the original `count_vk` and 0.
   - `s_new` remains unchanged as the loop only counts 'VK' pairs and does not modify the string.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The final value of `j` is -1, which is consistent with the loop iterating from `len(s_new) - 2` down to 0.
   - `new_count_vk` is the cumulative count of 'VK' pairs, which matches the behavior described.
   - `max_vk` is not affected by the loop and remains as the original value or 0.
   - `s_new` is a valid string with a minimum length of 2, as required for the loop to execute.

Thus, the final state after the loop has executed is as stated above.
