Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `len(s_new) - 2`, `new_count_vk` is either the original `new_count_vk` plus 1 if `s[i] == 'V'`, or the total number of occurrences where `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K' for all `j` in the range `0` to `len(s_new) - 2` if `s[i] != 'V'`, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the original `count_vk` and the updated `new_count_vk` (if applicable), and `s_new` is either unchanged or starts with 'V' followed by the rest of `s_original` starting from index 1 if `s[i] == 'K'`.***
