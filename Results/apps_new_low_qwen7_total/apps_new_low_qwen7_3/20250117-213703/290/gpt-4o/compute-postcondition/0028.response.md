Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(len(s_new) - 1)`. Therefore, the only variable directly controlled by the loop is `j`.

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `s` is a valid string.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`.
   - `i` is 0 (this is not part of the loop control).
   - `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`.
   - `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1 if `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K'.
   - `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` from `0` to `len(s_new) - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last value it was set to.

4. **Update the States**:
   - Since `j` is the only loop-controlled variable, we need to update its value.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < len(s_new) - 1`.
   - After the last iteration, `j` was `len(s_new) - 2` because the loop runs until `len(s_new) - 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `count_vk` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `max_vk` remains unchanged.
   - `new_count_vk` might change based on the loop body, but we don't know its exact value yet.
   - `len(s_new)` must still be greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `j` is now `len(s_new) - 1`.
- `new_count_vk` could be updated based on the loop body, but we do not know its exact value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum of `count_vk` and `new_count_vk`, `new_count_vk` is incremented by 1 if `s_new[j]` is 'V' and `s_new[j + 1]` is 'K', and `len(s_new)` must be greater than 1, `j` is `len(s_new) - 1`**.
