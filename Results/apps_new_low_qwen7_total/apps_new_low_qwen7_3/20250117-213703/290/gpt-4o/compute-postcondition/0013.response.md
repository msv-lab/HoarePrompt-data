Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable is `i`, and it iterates over the range of `len(s)`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The problem statement mentions that if the loop executed at least once, then `i` is `len(s) - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is `0`. However, since we are considering the first execution of the loop, `i` must be `0` (as it cannot be `len(s) - 2` for the first iteration).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(s)`. For the first iteration, `i` should be `0`, and this should satisfy the condition `0 < len(s)`.

4. **Other Variables**: 
   - `s` is a valid string.
   - `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`.
   - `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk` and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop.

Given these points, let's formulate the initial state required for the loop to execute the first time.

**State:**
- `s` is a valid string.
- `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`.

So, the final state before the loop executes for the first time is:

State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is equal to `count_vk`**
