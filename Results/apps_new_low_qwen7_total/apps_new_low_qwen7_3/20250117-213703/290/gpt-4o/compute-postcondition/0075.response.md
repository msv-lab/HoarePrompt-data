The code `print(max_vk)` simply prints the value of `max_vk` without changing its value. All other variables remain in their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a valid string, `count_vk` is the total number of occurrences of the substring "VK" in `s`, `i` is 0, `max_vk` is the maximum value between the initial `count_vk` and all `new_count_vk` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, and `s_new` remains unchanged after all iterations.**
