The function `func()` accepts a string `s` consisting only of the uppercase English letters "V" and "K" with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. It calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping "VK" substrings that can be achieved by swapping any "V" with a "K" or vice versa in the given string. After processing, it prints the maximum count of such substrings. Edge cases include strings without "VK", where the maximum count will be 0. If the string consists entirely of "V"s or "K"s, the maximum count will also be 0.
