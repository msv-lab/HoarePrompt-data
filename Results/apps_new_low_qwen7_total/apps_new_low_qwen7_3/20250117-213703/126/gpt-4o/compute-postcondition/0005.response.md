The loop head contains the following variables: `_`. The loop runs for 4 iterations, starting with `_` being 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2.

Since we are appending a new list to `traffic_lights`, the `traffic_lights` list will have an additional element after this iteration.

State: **`traffic_lights` is `[original_list, [integer1, integer2, ...], []]`, `_` is 2**
