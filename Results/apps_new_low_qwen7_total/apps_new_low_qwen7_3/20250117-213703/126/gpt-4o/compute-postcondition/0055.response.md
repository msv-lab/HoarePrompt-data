Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 0, j is 1, l is traffic_lights[0][0], s is traffic_lights[0][1], r is traffic_lights[0][2], p is traffic_lights[0][3], and (traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1) is True**

Explanation:
- The initial state sets `accident_possible` to `False`, `i` to `0`, `j` to `1`, `l` to `traffic_lights[0][0]`, `s` to `traffic_lights[0][1]`, `r` to `traffic_lights[0][2]`, and `p` to `traffic_lights[0][3]`.
- It also sets `(traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1)` to `True`.
- The code snippet then changes `accident_possible` to `True` and uses the `break` statement, which is typically used to exit a loop. However, since no loop is present in the given code, the `break` statement has no effect on the state.
- Therefore, the only change is setting `accident_possible` to `True`, and all other variables retain their initial or computed values from the precondition.
