The first line sets `accident_possible` to `True`. The second line is a `break` statement, which is typically used inside loops to exit them prematurely. However, since there are no loops in the provided code snippet, this `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables and will be ignored.

Given these observations, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `accident_possible`.

Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 0, j is 2, l is traffic_lights[0][0], s is traffic_lights[0][1], r is traffic_lights[0][2], p is traffic_lights[0][3]**
