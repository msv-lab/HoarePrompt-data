Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1. If the traffic lights at index ((4 + 0) % 4, 0) is equal to 1, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no modification in the else part.***
