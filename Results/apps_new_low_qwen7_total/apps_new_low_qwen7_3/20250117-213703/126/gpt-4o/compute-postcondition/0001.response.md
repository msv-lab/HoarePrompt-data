State before the loop starts: `traffic_lights` is an empty list.

Now, please think step by step: What must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(4):`, which means the loop will run 4 times. However, we need to determine the initial state necessary for the loop to execute its first iteration.
2. The only variable involved in the loop condition is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable since we don't care about the value inside the loop body.
3. The loop's continuation does not depend on the value of `_`, but rather on the fact that the range function generates 4 iterations. Therefore, the only relevant state for the loop to execute is related to the range function itself.
4. For the loop to execute the first time, the range function must generate at least one iteration. Since the loop is defined to run 4 times, the range function will always generate the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is simply the existence of the range function call within the context of the loop.

State: **`traffic_lights` is an empty list** (since this is the only provided state, no changes are needed for the initial state of `traffic_lights`).

However, to explicitly address what must hold true for the loop to execute:

State: **The loop will execute the first time because the range function is called with 4, generating at least one iteration.**
