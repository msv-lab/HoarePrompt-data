The initial state is defined as follows:
- `accident_possible` is `True`
- `i` is `0`
- `j` is `0`
- `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights` and it must be `1`
- `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights` and it must be `1`
- `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights` and it must be `1`
- `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights` and it is `1`
- `(traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1)` is `true`

The code snippet is:
```
accident_possible = True
break
```

Let's analyze the impact of each line:
1. `accident_possible = True`: This line reassigns the value of `accident_possible` to `True`. However, this assignment is redundant because `accident_possible` is already `True` in the initial state.
2. `break`: This line is a statement used within loops or match-case statements to exit early. However, there is no loop or match-case structure in the provided code, so this statement does not have any effect on the variables and simply causes a SyntaxError if executed outside of such a structure.

Given the lack of context (no loop or match-case), the `break` statement is invalid and would raise a SyntaxError if executed. But assuming the intent is to maintain the initial state without changing anything, the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **accident_possible is True, i is 0, j is 0, l is 1, s is 1, r is 1, p is 1, traffic_lights must be [[1, 1, 1, 1]]**
