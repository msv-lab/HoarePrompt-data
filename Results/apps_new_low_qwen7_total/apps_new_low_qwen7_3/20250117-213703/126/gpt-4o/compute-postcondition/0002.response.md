The code appends a list, which is the result of mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces, to the `traffic_lights` list. Since the range function is called with 4, it will generate at least one iteration, meaning the loop will execute at least once. After the first iteration, `traffic_lights` will contain the list created from the input.

Let's denote the input as `input_str`, which will be split into a list of strings, and then each string will be converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list will be appended to `traffic_lights`.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` contains a list created from the input, where each element is an integer; the loop will execute the second time**
