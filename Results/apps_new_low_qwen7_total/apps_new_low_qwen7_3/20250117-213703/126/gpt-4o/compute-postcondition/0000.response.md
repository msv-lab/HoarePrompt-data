The provided Python code initializes an empty list named `traffic_lights`. Since the initial state includes the traffic light states for four road parts in a counter-clockwise order, and the code initializes an empty list, no traffic light states are added to this list. Therefore, the list remains empty after executing the given code.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is an empty list**
