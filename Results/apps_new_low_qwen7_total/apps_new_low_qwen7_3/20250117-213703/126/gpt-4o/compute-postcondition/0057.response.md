Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `accident_possible` is False
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `l` is `traffic_lights[0][0]`
- `s` is `traffic_lights[0][1]`
- `r` is `traffic_lights[0][2]`
- `p` is `traffic_lights[0][3]`

### For Loop
```
for j in range(3):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `j = 1`
   
2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 2 (inclusive). Since `j` was initially 1, it will continue to increment in the next iterations.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration?**
   - `j` will increase by 1 each time the loop iterates.
   - The values of `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are derived from `traffic_lights[0]` and do not change within the loop.
   - The value of `accident_possible` can change if the condition `(traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1)` evaluates to True.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - In the next iteration, `j` will become 2.
   - We need to check the value of `accident_possible` after the loop body is executed with `j = 2`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - The condition to check is `(traffic_lights[(i + 2) % 4][2] == 1)`.
   - Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `(traffic_lights[2 % 4][2] == 1)`, which is `(traffic_lights[0][2] == 1)`.
   - The value of `r` is `traffic_lights[0][2]`.

6. **Possible States:**
   - If `(traffic_lights[0][2] == 1)`, then `accident_possible` will become True.
   - Otherwise, `accident_possible` remains False.

### Conclusion
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` will be 2.
- `accident_possible` will be either True or False depending on the value of `traffic_lights[0][2]`.

### Final State
State: **`accident_possible` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `l` is `traffic_lights[0][0]`, `s` is `traffic_lights[0][1]`, `r` is `traffic_lights[0][2]`, `p` is `traffic_lights[0][3]`**
