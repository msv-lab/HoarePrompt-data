The only variables in the loop head are `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than 3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, and `p` is 1. Since `j` is currently 0, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than 3.

Since `j` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than 3, which it is.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

State: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1**
