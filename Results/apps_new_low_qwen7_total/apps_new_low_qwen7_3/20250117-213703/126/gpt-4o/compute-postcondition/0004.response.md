The code appends a new list, which is created by converting the input (split by spaces) into integers, to the `traffic_lights` list. The loop variable `_` is initially set to 1, but its value does not affect the list operation. After executing the code, the `traffic_lights` list will contain the original list plus the newly appended list.

Let's denote the original list in `traffic_lights` as `original_list`. The input provided by `input().split()` will be converted to a list of integers, which will be appended to `traffic_lights`.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[original_list, [integer1, integer2, ...]]`, where `[integer1, integer2, ...]` is the list of integers obtained from the input. The loop variable `_` is 1 and we append a new list to `traffic_lights`.**
