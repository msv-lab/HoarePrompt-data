The code `traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` appends a new list, which is created by converting the input split into integers, to the `traffic_lights` list. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `original_list`, and the input from `input().split()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of the appended list. But we know that the `traffic_lights` list will now have one more element, which is the list of integers obtained from the input.

The output state is: `traffic_lights` is `[original_list, [integer1, integer2, ...], [], [input_split_as_integers]]`, where `input_split_as_integers` is the list of integers obtained from the input. The value of `_` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`traffic_lights` is `[original_list, [integer1, integer2, ...], [], [input_split_as_integers]]`, `_` is 2**
