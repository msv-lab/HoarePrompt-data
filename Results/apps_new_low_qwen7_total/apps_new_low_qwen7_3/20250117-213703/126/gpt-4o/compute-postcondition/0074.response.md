The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four road parts in a counter-clockwise order. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.

Case_1: If any of the lights are red (0), the function returns "Stop".
Case_2: If all lights are green (1), the function returns "Go".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input consisting of the states of traffic lights for four road parts and return either "Stop" if any light is red or "Go" if all lights are green.
