Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 0, `l` is the first element of `traffic_lights`, `s` is the second element of `traffic_lights`, `r` is the third element of `traffic_lights`, `p` is the fourth element of `traffic_lights` (p is still 1). This is because if any of `l`, `s`, or `r` is 1, `accident_possible` is set to True, and the other variables retain their original values. Since there is no else part, these conditions apply unconditionally.***
