Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop uses `range(4)`, which means the loop will run 4 times.
   - The loop variable `_` is used (a common convention for when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body).

2. **Determine the current state:**
   - `traffic_lights` is a list created from the input.
   - The loop will execute the second time, meaning it has already completed one iteration.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop has already executed once, we need to account for the fact that one iteration has passed.
   - The loop will execute the second time, so we need to ensure the loop condition is still met.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- The list `traffic_lights` remains the same.
- The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration. Since the loop has executed the first time, `_` is now 1 (it starts from 0).
- For the loop to execute the second time, the loop counter should be 1, as it will increment to 2 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`traffic_lights` contains a list created from the input, and the loop variable `_` is 1**
