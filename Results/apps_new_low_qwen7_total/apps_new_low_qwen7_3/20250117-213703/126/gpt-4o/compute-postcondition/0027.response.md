The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost block it is in. In this case, since there is no loop or block structure given in the initial state, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values. It simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or block if one existed.

Output State: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are all 1, and `traffic_lights` is [[1, 1, 1, 1]], and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
