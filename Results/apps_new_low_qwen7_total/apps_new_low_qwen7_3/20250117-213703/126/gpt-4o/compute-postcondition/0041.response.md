Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop in question is:
   ```python
   for j in range(3):
   ```
   This means `j` will iterate from 0 to 2 (inclusive).

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `accident_possible` is `True`
   - `i` is `4`
   - `j` is `1`
   - `l` is `1`
   - `s` is `1`
   - `r` is `1`
   - `p` is `1`

3. **Condition Inside the Loop**: The loop condition does not directly involve `j` but rather checks `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` for equality to 1. Since the condition inside the loop does not change the value of `j`, the value of `j` at the start of each iteration will be incremented by 1 from its initial value until it reaches 3.

4. **Determine the New Value of `j`**: Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.

5. **Adjust the State**: We only need to adjust the state of `j` because it is the variable that changes within the loop. All other variables (`accident_possible`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged as there are no assignments to them within the loop.

### Final State

State: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1**
