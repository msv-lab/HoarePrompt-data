Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided initial state and output states step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for _ in range(4):
    traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
```

**Initial State:** `traffic_lights` is an empty list.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Variable `traffic_lights`:** This list will be modified in every iteration of the loop.
- **Variable `_`:** This is a loop variable used to track the iteration count. It starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- **Input from `input().split()`:** This part of the code takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is appended to `traffic_lights`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

- The loop runs exactly 4 times regardless of the input.
- In each iteration, a new list of integers is appended to `traffic_lights`.
- Since the loop always runs 4 times, `traffic_lights` will contain exactly 4 lists, each created from the input provided in each iteration.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

- After the loop completes, `traffic_lights` will have 4 elements, each being a list of integers.
- The loop variable `_` will be 3 after the loop finishes because it increments from 0 to 3.
- Each of the 4 lists in `traffic_lights` corresponds to the input provided in each of the 4 iterations.

### Final Output State

After all 4 iterations of the loop, `traffic_lights` will contain 4 lists, each created from the input provided in each iteration. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[[], [], [], []]` if no input was provided in any of the 4 iterations. However, in practice, since the problem states that the loop executes and appends lists, we can generalize the final state as containing 4 lists of integers, regardless of their content.
