Postcondition: ***`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are all 1, and `traffic_lights` is [[1, 1, 1, 1]]. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is equal to 1, then no changes are made to the variables. If `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` is not equal to 1, then no changes are made to the variables.***
