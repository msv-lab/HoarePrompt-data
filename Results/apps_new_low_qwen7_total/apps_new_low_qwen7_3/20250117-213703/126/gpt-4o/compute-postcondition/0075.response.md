Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four road parts in a counter-clockwise order. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green. After processing the input, the function checks whether an accident is possible based on the current traffic light states. An accident is considered possible if any of the following conditions are met:
1. Any of the lights (l, s, r, p) are red while another light is green.
2. A green light (p) is followed by two other green lights (l and s or s and r or r and l).

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes the value of `accident_possible`, which is either True or False, and the loop variables `i` and `j` that are set during the last iteration of the inner loop.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the input does not consist of exactly four lines with four integers each, the program will behave unpredictably due to the nature of the `input().split()` method, which may not handle incorrect input formats gracefully.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not validate the input to ensure that each line contains exactly four integers. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is malformed.
