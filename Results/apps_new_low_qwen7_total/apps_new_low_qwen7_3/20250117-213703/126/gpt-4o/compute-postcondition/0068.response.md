Output State: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1.**

### Analysis Breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `accident_possible` is `False`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs 4 times, as defined by `for i in range(4)`.
   - For each iteration (`i` ranges from 0 to 3):
     - Variables `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` are extracted from `traffic_lights[i]`.
     - The condition `p == 1` is checked.
       - If `p` is not `1`, `accident_possible` remains `False` and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.
       - If `p` is `1`, the inner logic checks if any of `l`, `s`, or `r` is `1`.
         - If any of `l`, `s`, or `r` is `1`, `accident_possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks out of the innermost loop.
         - Additionally, it checks if any of `traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j]` (for `j` in range(3)) is `1`. If so, `accident_possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks out of this nested loop.
           - This means `accident_possible` will be `True` if any of `l`, `s`, or `r` is `1` or if any of the elements in the list corresponding to the shifted index `(i + j) % 4` is `1`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - From the provided information, after the loop has executed 3 times, `accident_possible` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`. This implies that one of the conditions inside the loop was met to set `accident_possible` to `True`.
   - When `accident_possible` is `True`, the loop breaks, and no further iterations occur.
   - Since the loop broke on the third iteration, the value of `i` is `0`, and `j` is `0`. However, based on the problem statement, if the loop executed up to the third iteration, then the specific values of `l`, `s`, `r`, and `p` for the last successful check would be such that `accident_possible` became `True`.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes its execution is: **`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1.**
