### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Storing Traffic Light Configurations:**
   - The program correctly reads the traffic light configurations for each of the four parts and stores them in the `traffic_lights` list. This part is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Checking Pedestrian Lights and Neighboring Lanes:**
   - The program iterates through each part and checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green.
   - If the pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`), it checks if any of the other lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are also green.
   - It also checks the lights of the neighboring parts to see if they could cause an accident.

3. **Neighboring Parts Check Logic:**
   - The nested loop correctly checks the neighboring parts. For each part, it iterates over its three neighboring parts (using the modulo operation to wrap around).
   - If any of these neighboring parts have a green light (`1`), the accident flag (`accident_possible`) is set to `True`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - Based on the value of `accident_possible`, the program prints "YES" or "NO".

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:

1. **Loop to Read Input:**
   - The loop runs exactly 4 times, reading the traffic light configurations for each of the 4 parts.
   - The `traffic_lights` list is correctly populated with the input values.

2. **Checking Pedestrian and Neighboring Lanes:**
   - The outer loop iterates over each part (from `0` to `3`).
   - For each part, the inner conditional checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green.
   - If the pedestrian light is green, it further checks if any of the other lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are green.
   - It also checks the neighboring parts to ensure no green lights cause an accident.

3. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - Consider the first example input:
     ```
     1 0 0 1
     0 1 0 0
     0 0 1 0
     0 0 0 1
     ```
   - For part 1 (`1 0 0 1`):
     - `p` is `1`, so the program checks `l`, `s`, `r`.
     - Since `l` is `1`, an accident is possible, and `accident_possible` is set to `True`.
   - No need to check further as the condition is already met.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" as expected.
