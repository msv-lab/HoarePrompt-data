You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

- Program: 
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four road parts in a counter-clockwise order. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green.
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given Python loop and the provided initial state and output states step-by-step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #
    #The loop is defined as follows:
    #```python
    #for _ in range(4):
    #    traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #```
    #
    #**Initial State:** `traffic_lights` is an empty list.
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #
    #- **Variable `traffic_lights`:** This list will be modified in every iteration of the loop.
    #- **Variable `_`:** This is a loop variable used to track the iteration count. It starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
    #- **Input from `input().split()`:** This part of the code takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is appended to `traffic_lights`.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #
    #- The loop runs exactly 4 times regardless of the input.
    #- In each iteration, a new list of integers is appended to `traffic_lights`.
    #- Since the loop always runs 4 times, `traffic_lights` will contain exactly 4 lists, each created from the input provided in each iteration.
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #
    #- After the loop completes, `traffic_lights` will have 4 elements, each being a list of integers.
    #- The loop variable `_` will be 3 after the loop finishes because it increments from 0 to 3.
    #- Each of the 4 lists in `traffic_lights` corresponds to the input provided in each of the 4 iterations.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After all 4 iterations of the loop, `traffic_lights` will contain 4 lists, each created from the input provided in each iteration. Therefore, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State: `traffic_lights` is `[[], [], [], []]` if no input was provided in any of the 4 iterations. However, in practice, since the problem states that the loop executes and appends lists, we can generalize the final state as containing 4 lists of integers, regardless of their content.
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        l, s, r, p = traffic_lights[i]
        
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `accident_possible` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1.
    if accident_possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`accident_possible` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `l` is 1, `s` is 1, `r` is 1, `p` is 1, and either 'YES' is printed or the values remain unchanged based on the condition of `accident_possible`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks for the possibility of an accident at the intersection based on the given traffic light configuration. It iterates through each part and checks if the pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`). If it is, it then checks if any of the incoming traffic lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are also green. Additionally, it checks the adjacent parts to ensure that no green incoming traffic light from another part can lead to an accident with the pedestrian crossing. The logic seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
