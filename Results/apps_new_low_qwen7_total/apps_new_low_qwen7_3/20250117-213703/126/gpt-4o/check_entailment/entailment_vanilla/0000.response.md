Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the traffic light configurations for each of the four parts.
2. It iterates through each part to check if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green.
3. If the pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`), it checks if any of the other lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are also green.
4. Additionally, it checks the lights of the neighboring parts to see if they could cause an accident.
5. The logic correctly identifies that if any neighboring lane's light is green while the pedestrian light is green, an accident is possible.
6. The program prints "YES" if an accident is possible and "NO" otherwise.

Given the analysis, the provided solution matches the problem requirements and correctly determines if an accident is possible based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
