You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l — left, s — straight, r — right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing.  [Image] 

An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.

Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.

Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p — for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.


-----Output-----

On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Input
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

Output
NO

Input
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4.

In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.

- Program:
def func():
    traffic_lights = []
    for _ in range(4):
        traffic_lights.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    accident_possible = False
    for i in range(4):
        (l, s, r, p) = traffic_lights[i]
        if p == 1:
            if l == 1 or s == 1 or r == 1:
                accident_possible = True
                break
            for j in range(3):
                if traffic_lights[(i + j) % 4][j] == 1:
                    accident_possible = True
                    break
            if accident_possible:
                break
    if accident_possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but processes input consisting of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four road parts in a counter-clockwise order. The possible values for each light are 0 for red and 1 for green. After processing the input, the function checks whether an accident is possible based on the current traffic light states. An accident is considered possible if any of the following conditions are met:
1. Any of the lights (l, s, r, p) are red while another light is green.
2. A green light (p) is followed by two other green lights (l and s or s and r or r and l).

If an accident is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes the value of `accident_possible`, which is either True or False, and the loop variables `i` and `j` that are set during the last iteration of the inner loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks for the possibility of an accident at the intersection based on the given traffic light configuration. It iterates through each part and checks if the pedestrian light is green (`p == 1`). If it is, it then checks if any of the incoming traffic lights (`l`, `s`, `r`) are also green. Additionally, it checks the adjacent parts to ensure that no green incoming traffic light from another part can lead to an accident with the pedestrian crossing. The logic seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
