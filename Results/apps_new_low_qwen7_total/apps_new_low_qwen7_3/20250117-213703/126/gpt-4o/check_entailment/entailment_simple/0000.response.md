### Reasoning:

Let's review the logic of the given annotated program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input for 4 road parts, each with 4 lights (left, straight, right, pedestrian).
   - The input is correctly read and stored in the `traffic_lights` list.

2. **Checking for Accidents:**
   - The program iterates over each of the 4 road parts.
   - For each part, it checks if the pedestrian light (`p`) is green (`1`).
     - If the pedestrian light is green, it checks if any of the other three lights (left, straight, right) are also green.
       - If any of these lights are green, an accident is possible, and the program sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Additionally, for each part, it checks the next 3 parts in a counter-clockwise manner.
     - If any of the corresponding lights in the next 3 parts are green, an accident is possible, and the program sets `accident_possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - Based on the value of `accident_possible`, the program prints either "YES" or "NO".

Given the provided examples and the logical flow of the program, let's verify the correctness:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1 0 0 1
  0 1 0 0
  0 0 1 0
  0 0 0 1
  ```
- Analysis:
  - Part 1: Pedestrian light is green (1), and Left light is green (1) -> Accident possible.
- Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  0 1 1 0
  1 0 1 0
  1 1 0 0
  0 0 0 1
  ```
- Analysis:
  - No pedestrian light is green, and none of the other lights form an accident scenario.
- Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1 0 0 0
  0 0 0 1
  0 0 0 0
  1 0 1 0
  ```
- Analysis:
  - Part 4: Pedestrian light is green (1), and Right light is green (1) -> Accident possible.
- Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

Based on the analysis, the logic of the program matches the requirements and examples provided. The program correctly identifies if an accident is possible by checking both direct and counter-clockwise adjacent parts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an accident is possible based on the given traffic light configurations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
