Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input data, which consists of four lines, each containing four integers representing the state of the traffic lights (l, s, r, p) for each of the four road parts.
2. The program iterates through each of the four road parts and checks if an accident is possible:
   - It first checks if the pedestrian light (p) is green and any of the other three lights (l, s, r) are also green. If this condition is met, an accident is marked as possible.
   - Then, it checks if the pedestrian light (p) is green and the next two consecutive lights in the counter-clockwise direction are also green. If this condition is met, an accident is marked as possible.
3. The logic in the program accurately reflects the criteria for an accident as described in the problem statement.
4. The program correctly outputs 'YES' if an accident is possible and 'NO' otherwise based on the checks performed.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
