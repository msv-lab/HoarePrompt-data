Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to type the given string. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the string can be split into two equal halves, and the second half can be appended after copying the first half.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaaaaa
```

The correct output should be 3 operations: type 'aaa', copy it, and type the remaining 'aaa'. However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum operations as 6 because it does not check for the possibility of copying the entire string.

The program should also consider cases where the string can be split into multiple segments and copied appropriately. For instance, for the input `s = "abcabc"`, the correct output should be 4 operations: type 'abc', copy it, and type the remaining 'abc'. The current implementation does not account for these scenarios correctly.
