You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program:
n = int(input())
s = input()
result = func_1(n, s)
print(result)

def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
    return min_operations



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It calculates and returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific condition across all possible substrings of `s`. If no such substrings exist, it returns `n`.

The function iterates through all possible substrings of `s` and checks if the first half of each substring is equal to the second half. If a match is found, it calculates the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching substring and updates `min_operations` with the smallest value found. If no matching substrings are found after checking all possibilities, it returns `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either adding one character at a time or copying a prefix and appending it to the current string.

Let's break down the logic:
1. The program initializes `min_operations` to `n`, which represents the worst-case scenario where each character is added one by one.
2. It iterates through possible prefix lengths (`i`), checking if the prefix of length `i` matches the suffix starting from index `i`.
3. If a match is found, it calculates the total operations required, which includes typing the prefix `i` times (once for the initial prefix and once for the copy) plus the remaining characters `(n - 2 * i)`.
4. It updates `min_operations` with the minimum value between the current `min_operations` and the newly calculated operations.
5. Finally, it returns `min_operations`.

This logic correctly identifies if there is a substring that can be copied and reused to minimize the number of operations. The provided solution seems to follow the problem's requirements accurately.
