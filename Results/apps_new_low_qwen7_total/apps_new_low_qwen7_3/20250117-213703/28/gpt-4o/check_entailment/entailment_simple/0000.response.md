Reasoning:

1. **Input and Variables Initialization**:
   - The input is correctly read into `n` (the length of the string) and `s` (the string itself).
   - The function `func_1` is called with these variables, and the result is printed.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `min_operations` to `n`, which is the base case where no copying is used.
   - It then iterates through possible substring lengths from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each substring length `i`, it checks if the substring `s[:i]` is equal to the substring `s[i:2*i]`. If they are equal, it calculates the number of operations required as `i + 1 + (n - 2*i)` and updates `min_operations` if this is less than the current `min_operations`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic in the function correctly identifies potential substrings that can be copied and calculates the minimum number of operations needed.
   - The function correctly returns the minimum number of operations found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no suitable substring is found by defaulting to `n` operations.

5. **Output**:
   - The function's output is correctly printed.

Given the above analysis, the provided program logic seems to accurately solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
