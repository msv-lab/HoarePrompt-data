Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either adding one character at a time or copying a prefix and appending it to the current string.

Let's break down the logic:
1. The program initializes `min_operations` to `n`, which represents the worst-case scenario where each character is added one by one.
2. It iterates through possible prefix lengths (`i`), checking if the prefix of length `i` matches the suffix starting from index `i`.
3. If a match is found, it calculates the total operations required, which includes typing the prefix `i` times (once for the initial prefix and once for the copy) plus the remaining characters `(n - 2 * i)`.
4. It updates `min_operations` with the minimum value between the current `min_operations` and the newly calculated operations.
5. Finally, it returns `min_operations`.

This logic correctly identifies if there is a substring that can be copied and reused to minimize the number of operations. The provided solution seems to follow the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
