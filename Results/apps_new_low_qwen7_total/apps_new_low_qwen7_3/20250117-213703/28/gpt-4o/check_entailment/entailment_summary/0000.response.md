Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum number of operations required to type the string `s` by either typing one character at a time or copying a segment of the string and appending it to itself.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `min_operations` to `n`, which represents the worst-case scenario where no copying is used.
   - It then iterates over all possible starting points `i` from 1 to `n-1` to check if the substring `s[:i]` matches the substring `s[i:2*i]`.
   - If a match is found, it calculates the total operations required:
     - `i` operations to type the first part of the matching substring.
     - 1 operation to copy the matched part.
     - `n - 2*i` operations to type the remaining part of the string.
   - The function updates `min_operations` with the minimum value found during the iteration.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no matching substrings are found, the function correctly returns `n` as the result.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example "abcabca":
     - The function finds that `s[:3] == s[3:6]`, so it calculates `3 + 1 + (7 - 6) = 5` operations.
   - For the example "abcdefgh":
     - No matching substrings are found, so the function returns `8` operations.

Given the analysis, the function logic appears to be correct according to the problem description and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
