Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It calculates and returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific condition across all possible substrings of `s`. If no such substrings exist, it returns `n`.

The function iterates through all possible substrings of `s` and checks if the first half of each substring is equal to the second half. If a match is found, it calculates the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching substring and updates `min_operations` with the smallest value found. If no matching substrings are found after checking all possibilities, it returns `n`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that `n` is always positive and that `s` is a non-empty string. If `n` is zero or `s` is an empty string, the function should handle these cases appropriately, either by returning `n` or raising an exception.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the string `s` might contain non-lowercase Latin letters, although the annotations imply that it should only operate on such strings. If non-lowercase letters are present, the function should either raise an exception or handle them in a specified manner.
- The function does not provide a clear definition of the "specific condition" mentioned in the annotations, which could affect the calculation of the number of operations. This should be clarified or defined within the function's documentation.**
