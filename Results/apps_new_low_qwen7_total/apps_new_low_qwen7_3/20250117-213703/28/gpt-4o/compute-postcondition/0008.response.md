Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is at least 1
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.
5. **Check `n`**: Since `n` is at least 1, it remains unchanged.

Given the conditions, if `i` becomes 3 and the condition `i < n` still holds true (since `n` is at least 1), the loop can execute again.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` should be 3
- `n` should remain at least 1

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 1**
