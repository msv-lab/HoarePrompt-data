The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must still be at least 1.

Since the value of `min_operations` is determined inside the loop based on the condition `s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]`, but no changes are mentioned for `min_operations` outside the loop, we do not need to adjust its value.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
