Output State: **i is 2, n is at least 1, operations is 3, min_operations is undefined**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates the value of `operations` based on the current values of `i` and `n`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 1, `operations` becomes `2 + 1 + (n - 2*2)`, which simplifies to `3 + n - 4`, resulting in `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `operations` will be at least 0. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `operations`, but we know it will be `n - 1`.
- The second line tries to assign the value of `operations` to `min_operations`. However, `min_operations` is not defined before this line, so it remains undefined. Therefore, the only changes made are to `operations`.

Given these points, the final output state includes the updated value of `operations` and leaves `min_operations` as undefined.
