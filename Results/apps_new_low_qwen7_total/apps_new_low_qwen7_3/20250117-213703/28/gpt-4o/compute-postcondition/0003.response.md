The initial state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- The substring `s[:i]` is equal to the substring `s[i:2 * i]`

The code snippet provided is:
```
operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
```

Let's break down the code:
1. `operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)`: This line calculates the value of `operations` based on the current values of `i` and `n`. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to `operations = 1 + 1 + (n - 2 * 1) = 2 + (n - 2) = n`.
2. `min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)`: This line updates `min_operations` with the minimum value between the current value of `min_operations` and the newly calculated `operations`. However, since `min_operations` is not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be `None` or not defined, so the first operation will set `min_operations` to `n`.

After executing both lines of the code, the updated state is:
- `operations` is `n`
- `min_operations` is `n`

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and we don't have any other modifications to `n` or `s`, the final output state is:
Output State: **i is 1, n is n, min_operations is n**
