The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns `min_operations`, which is the minimum value achieved after checking all possible substrings, or `n` if no matching substrings are found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, and return the minimum value of operations needed to achieve a certain condition across all possible substrings, or `n` if no such substrings exist.
