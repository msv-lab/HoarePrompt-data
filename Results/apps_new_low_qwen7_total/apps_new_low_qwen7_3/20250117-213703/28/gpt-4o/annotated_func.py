#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s, and s is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, s):
    min_operations = n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[:i] == s[i:2 * i]:
            operations = i + 1 + (n - 2 * i)
            min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_operations` is the minimum value achieved after checking all possible substrings, or `n` if no matching substrings are found.
    return min_operations
    #The program returns `min_operations` which is the minimum value achieved after checking all possible substrings, or `n` if no matching substrings are found
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. It calculates and returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific condition across all possible substrings of `s`. If no such substrings exist, it returns `n`.

The function iterates through all possible substrings of `s` and checks if the first half of each substring is equal to the second half. If a match is found, it calculates the number of operations needed based on the length of the matching substring and updates `min_operations` with the smallest value found. If no matching substrings are found after checking all possibilities, it returns `n`.
