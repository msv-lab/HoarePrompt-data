The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) consisting of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to make the string \( s \) such that no substring of length greater than 1 repeats consecutively. If the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., \( n \) is less than 1), the function will handle these cases appropriately. Edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) (in which case no deletions are needed), and when the string \( s \) already meets the criteria (no repeated substrings of length greater than 1). The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this, where \( dp[i] \) represents the minimum number of deletions required for the first \( i \) characters of \( s \).
