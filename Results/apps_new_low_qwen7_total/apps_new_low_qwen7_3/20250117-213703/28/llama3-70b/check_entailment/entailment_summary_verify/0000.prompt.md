You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) consisting of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to make the string \( s \) such that no substring of length greater than 1 repeats consecutively. If the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., \( n \) is less than 1), the function will handle these cases appropriately. Edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) (in which case no deletions are needed), and when the string \( s \) already meets the criteria (no repeated substrings of length greater than 1). The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this, where \( dp[i] \) represents the minimum number of deletions required for the first \( i \) characters of \( s \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to type the given string. Specifically, the logic inside the nested loop is flawed. The expression `(i - j) // (i - j - j)` will always result in a division by zero or an incorrect value, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```

The correct minimum number of operations should be 4 (type 'aaa', then copy, then type 'bbb'). However, the program might produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate the minimum operations by considering the possibility of copying the string and appending it to itself. A more accurate approach would involve dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum operations required to form the prefix of the string up to each character.
