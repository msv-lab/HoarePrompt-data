Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve a different problem compared to the given problem description. The problem description asks for the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string using an initial empty string and optionally copying the entire string once. The provided solution instead tries to compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string such that no substring of length greater than 1 repeats consecutively.

The logic in the program does not match the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the `dp` array in the provided code is meant to store the minimum number of deletions, whereas the problem requires the minimum number of operations (addition and optional copying).

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the stated problem.

Correctness: **False**
