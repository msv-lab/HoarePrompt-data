You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.

Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:  add a character to the end of the string. 

Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.

For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.

If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input containing only one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.


-----Examples-----
Input
7
abcabca

Output
5

Input
8
abcdefgh

Output
8



-----Note-----

The first test described in the problem statement.

In the second test you can only type all the characters one by one.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
    print(dp[n])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the string, and the second line contains a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())

s = input()

dp = [0] * (n + 1)

dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i
        
        for j in range(i):
            if s[j:i] in s[:j]:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n + 3`, `dp` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
    print(dp[n])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) consisting of \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. It then computes and prints the minimum number of deletions required to make the string \( s \) such that no substring of length greater than 1 repeats consecutively. If the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., \( n \) is less than 1), the function will handle these cases appropriately. Edge cases include when \( n = 1 \) (in which case no deletions are needed), and when the string \( s \) already meets the criteria (no repeated substrings of length greater than 1). The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this, where \( dp[i] \) represents the minimum number of deletions required for the first \( i \) characters of \( s \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to find the minimum number of operations needed to type a given string `s` by either typing each character one by one or copying a prefix of the string. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations required to type the first `i` characters of `s`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0] = 0` because no operations are needed to type an empty string.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For each position `i` from 1 to `n`, `dp[i]` is initialized to `i` (the number of operations needed if each character is typed one by one).
   - For each prefix ending at `i`, the program checks if the substring `s[j:i]` appears earlier in the string. If it does, it updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1 + (i - j - 1) // (i - j - j)` (which accounts for the cost of copying the prefix `s[j:i]`).

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in the inner loop is designed to find the optimal prefix that can be copied. The formula `(i - j - 1) // (i - j - j)` is intended to calculate how many times the prefix can be repeated.
   - The overall approach ensures that the solution considers both the cost of typing each character individually and the cost of copying prefixes.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to type the given string.

Correctness: **True**
