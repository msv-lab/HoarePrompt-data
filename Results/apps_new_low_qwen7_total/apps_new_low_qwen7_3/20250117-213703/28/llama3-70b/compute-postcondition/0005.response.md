Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - The substring `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
   ```
   - First, we need to evaluate the expression `(i - j - j)`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, we get `(1 - 0 - 0) = 1`.
   - The expression simplifies to `(i - j) // 1 + 1`. Since `i - j` is 1, we get `1 // 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - So, the equation becomes `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 2)`.
   - Given `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is not specified but does not affect this calculation directly as `dp[0]` is not used here, we can consider the minimum value between `dp[1]` and `1 + 2`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and the new value calculated (`1 + 2 = 3`). Hence, `dp[1]` is updated to 1 because `1` is less than `3`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `i` remains 1
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
   - `dp[1]` is now 1
   - `j` remains 0
   - The substring `s[j:i]` remains in `s[:j]`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 0, the substring `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]`**
