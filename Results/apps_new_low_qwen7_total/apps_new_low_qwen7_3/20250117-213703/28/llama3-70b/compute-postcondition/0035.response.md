Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 1. If the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `dp[i]`.**
