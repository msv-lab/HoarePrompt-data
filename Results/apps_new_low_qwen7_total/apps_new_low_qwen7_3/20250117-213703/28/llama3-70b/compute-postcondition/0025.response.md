Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[1] + 2)` if `n > 1` and `min(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)` if `n == 1`. The condition `s[j:i] in s[:j]` does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, and `dp[i]` since there is no else part and the if part already covers all possible scenarios for `n`.***
