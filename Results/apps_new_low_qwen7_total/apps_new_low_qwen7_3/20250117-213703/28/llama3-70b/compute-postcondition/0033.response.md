Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `dp[i]` is the minimum of `n + 2` and `dp[0] + 2`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s` is a string
   - `j` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - The loop head contains the variable `j`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but it is clear that `j` will be incremented in each iteration.
   - The loop will run until `j` reaches `i`.

4. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.

5. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `1`.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we need to update its value.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of `n + 2` and `dp[0] + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 1**
