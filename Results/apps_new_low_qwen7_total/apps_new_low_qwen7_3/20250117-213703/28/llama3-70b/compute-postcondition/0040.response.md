Output State: `i` is `n + 3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `dp` is a list of integers with 101 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `dp[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n + 3` will be the minimum value computed based on the condition inside the nested loop, and `j` ranges from 0 to `i - 1`.

To summarize:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: The loop updates the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` is the minimum value computed based on the condition inside the nested loop. The variable `i` iterates from 1 to `n + 3` because the outer loop runs from 1 to `n + 1` and then continues to increment `i` by 1 twice more as specified in the given output states.

2. **Track Variable Changes**: 
   - `dp[0]` remains 0 and is constant throughout the loop.
   - `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 3`.
   - `j` ranges from 0 to `i - 1` in the nested loop.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: 
   - For each `i`, `dp[i]` is set to `i` initially and then updated if `s[j:i]` is a substring of `s[:j]`. This ensures that `dp[i]` holds the minimum value satisfying the given condition.
   - The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 3`.

4. **Verify Relationships**: The relationships and invariants identified are consistent with the described iterations and final output state. `i` will reach `n + 3` and `dp` will be updated according to the condition in the nested loop, making the final state accurate.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `dp` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
