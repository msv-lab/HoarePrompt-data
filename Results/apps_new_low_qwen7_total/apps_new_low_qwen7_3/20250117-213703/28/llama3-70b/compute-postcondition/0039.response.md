Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum value among `dp[0] + 2`, `dp[1] + 2`, ..., `dp[n+1] + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is `n + 2`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - The condition `if s[j:i] in s[:j]` checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is a substring of `s[:j]`.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts as `n + 2` and remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `dp[i]` is updated based on the loop's conditions.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `s` is unchanged.
   - `j` starts from `0` and increases by `1` until it reaches `i`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will execute `i` times, updating `dp[i]` each time.
   - Each iteration of the loop checks if the substring `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]` and updates `dp[i]` accordingly.
   - After the loop completes, `dp[i]` will hold the minimum value obtained from all possible updates.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The relationship `dp[i]` being updated to the minimum of `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` for each `j` in the range ensures that `dp[i]` reflects the smallest possible value after considering all substrings.
   - Since `i` is `n + 2`, the loop effectively considers all indices from `0` to `n+1` for updating `dp[i]`.

Given the above analysis, the final values are:
- `i` remains `n + 2`.
- `dp[i]` is the minimum value among all possible updates.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `n + 2` after the loop, but its value during the loop was not relevant to the final state.
