Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of `n + 2` and `dp[0] + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 0. If the substring `s[j:i]` is found in the prefix `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to `min(n + 2, dp[0] + 2)`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains as `min(n + 2, dp[0] + 2)` regardless of whether the substring is found or not.***
