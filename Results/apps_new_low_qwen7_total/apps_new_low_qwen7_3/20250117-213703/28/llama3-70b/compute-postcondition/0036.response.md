Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `dp[i]` is the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 2`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s` is a string
   - `j` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

5. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < i`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 2` and `j` starts at 1 and increments to 2, the condition `j < i` will still hold true because `n` is at least 1, making `i` at least 3.

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `j` needs to be updated to 2.
   - The other variables (`i`, `dp[i]`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 2**
