The code `dp[i] = i` updates the value of `dp[i]` to `i`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n + 2`. Therefore, `dp[i]` will be set to `n + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged), `s` is a string (unchanged), `j` is an index within the string `s` (unchanged)**
