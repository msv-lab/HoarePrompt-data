The code assigns the value of `i` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`. After the assignment, `dp[i]` will hold the value of `i`.

- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `dp[i]` is now `i`, which is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i]` is `n + 1`**
