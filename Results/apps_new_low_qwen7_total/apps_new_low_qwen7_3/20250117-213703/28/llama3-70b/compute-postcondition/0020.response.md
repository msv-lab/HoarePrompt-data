Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < i`.

3. **Determine the initial states**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `j` is an index within the string `s`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`, the next value of `j` will be `0` if it was previously `i-1`.
   - The value of `i` remains `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `j` becomes `0` (since it starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `i-1`).

6. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `0` and `i` remains `n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string**.
