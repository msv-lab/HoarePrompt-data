Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 0. If the substring `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]`, the state remains unchanged. Since `j` is 0 and `i` is 1, this condition cannot be true, so the state remains as `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 0.***
