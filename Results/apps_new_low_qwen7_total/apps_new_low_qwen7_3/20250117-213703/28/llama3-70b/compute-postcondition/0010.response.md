Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. Here, the variables are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < i`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]`, the condition remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
   - The condition `j < i` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Since `i` was not changed during the previous iteration, it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `dp[1]` remains the same (1).
   - If `s[j:i]` is in `s[:j]`, the condition remains unchanged.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 2**.
