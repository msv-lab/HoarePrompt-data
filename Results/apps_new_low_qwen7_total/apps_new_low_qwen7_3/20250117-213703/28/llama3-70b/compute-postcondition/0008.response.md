First, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `j` is 1

Let's substitute these values into the code snippet:
- Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the expression `(i - j - j)` becomes `(1 - 1 - 1)`, which results in `-1`.
- The division operation `(i - j) // (i - j - j)` becomes `0 // -1`, which is 0 (integer division in Python).
- Therefore, the expression `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1` simplifies to `dp[1] + 0 + 1`, which is `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.

So, the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1)` becomes:
- `dp[1] = min(dp[1], 2)`

Since `dp[1]` is initially 1, the minimum of 1 and 2 is 1. Therefore, `dp[1]` remains 1.

The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 1**
