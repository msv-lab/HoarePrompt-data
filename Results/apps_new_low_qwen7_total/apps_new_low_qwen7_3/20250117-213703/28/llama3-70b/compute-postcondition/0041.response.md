The code `print(dp[n])` prints the value of `dp[n]`. This does not assign any new value to any variable; it simply outputs the current value of `dp[n]`. The values of `i`, `dp`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `dp` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters; the value of `dp[n]` is printed.**
