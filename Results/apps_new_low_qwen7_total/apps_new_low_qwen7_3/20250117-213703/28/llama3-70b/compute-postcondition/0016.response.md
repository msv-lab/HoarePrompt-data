To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to analyze the given initial state and the condition for the loop to proceed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (`n >= 1`)
- `dp[i]` is `n + 1`

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `j < i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start executing if `j` is less than `i`.
   - For the first iteration, `j` should be 0 (the smallest possible value).

2. **Current State Before First Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - Since `n >= 1`, `i` will be at least 2 (because `n + 1`).

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For `j = 0` to be within the range of `j < i`, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n >= 1`, `i` is always at least 2, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

4. **Additional Constraints:**
   - There are no additional constraints mentioned for `dp[i]` or other variables that would affect the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n >= 1`, the loop will always execute at least once because `i` will be at least 2. Therefore, the initial state is already sufficient to ensure the loop executes the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
