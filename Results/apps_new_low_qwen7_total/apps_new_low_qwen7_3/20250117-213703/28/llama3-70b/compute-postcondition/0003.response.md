State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions**: The loop variable is `j`, which is initialized in the `range(i)` function. The loop will run from `j = 0` to `j < i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop is defined as `for j in range(i)`, the value of `j` will start from `0` (inclusive).

3. **Check the condition for the first iteration**: For the first iteration of the loop, `j` should be less than `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `j` must be 0 to satisfy this condition.

4. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `dp[1]`) are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the initial state. They do not need to change for the loop to execute.

5. **State the final requirement**: Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be 0. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dp[1]` do not need to change from their initial states.

Thus, the required state is: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 0**.
