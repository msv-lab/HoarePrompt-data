The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[n]` is the minimum value computed based on the condition inside the loop (this state does not need to be adjusted)
- `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1` (this state does not need to be adjusted)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`
- `n` must remain the same and still be greater than or equal to 1

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
