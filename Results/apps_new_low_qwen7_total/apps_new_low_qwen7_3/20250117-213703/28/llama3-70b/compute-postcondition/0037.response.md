Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 2**

Explanation:
- The initial state had `i = n + 2`.
- The initial state also had `dp[i]` being updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 2`.
- The code updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (i - j) // (i - j - j) + 1`. Given `j` is 2, this simplifies to `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[2] + (i - 2) // (i - 2 - 2) + 1)`.
- Since `i` is `n + 2`, the expression `(i - 2) // (i - 2 - 2)` simplifies to `(n + 2 - 2) // (n + 2 - 2 - 2) = n // (n - 2)`. This results in `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[2] + n // (n - 2) + 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the final state is as described above.
