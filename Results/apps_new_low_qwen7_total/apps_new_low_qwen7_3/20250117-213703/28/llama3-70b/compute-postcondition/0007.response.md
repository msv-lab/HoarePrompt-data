Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `j`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < i`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the loop will iterate for `j` values from `0` to `0` (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1 and the loop is iterating from `0` to `0`, `j` will only be 0 during this iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will increment to 1 and the loop will terminate because `j` will no longer be less than `i`.

5. **Final State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `dp[1]` remains 1.
   - `j` will increment to 1 after the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `j` is 1**
