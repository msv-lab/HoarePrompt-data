Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `s` is a string
   - `j` is an index within the string `s`
   - `dp[i]` is `n + 1` unless specific matches are found within the loop, in which case `dp[i]` is updated accordingly.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1` and the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1 + 1 = n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is used as the upper bound of the loop but is not modified inside the loop.
   - `s` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but at the start of the next iteration, its state is unknown until the loop body is executed. Therefore, we cannot assume any specific value for `dp[i]` yet.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 2`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
- `s` is a string (unchanged)
- `j` is an index within the string `s` (unchanged)
- `dp[i]` is unknown at the start of the next iteration (we only know it will be updated within the loop body)

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s`, and `dp[i]` is unknown**
