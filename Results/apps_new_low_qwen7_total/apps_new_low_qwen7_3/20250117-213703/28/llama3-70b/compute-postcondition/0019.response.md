Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s`. If the substring `s[j:i]` is found within the substring `s[:j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + (n + 1 - j) // (n + 1 - 2j) + 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `dp[i]`.***
