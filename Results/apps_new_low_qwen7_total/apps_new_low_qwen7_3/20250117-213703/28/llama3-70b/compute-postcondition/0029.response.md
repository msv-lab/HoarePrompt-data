Let's break down the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial State Before Loop Starts**:
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `dp[i]` is `n + 2`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
   - `s` is a string (unchanged)
   - `j` is an index within the string `s` (unchanged)

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i)`.
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`.

3. **First Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be in the range `[0, i - 1]`.
   - Since `j` is an index within the string `s`, it should be a valid index for the string `s`.
   - Additionally, the value of `j` at the start of the loop must be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Validation of Initial Conditions**:
   - `i` is set to `n + 2`, which means `i` is at least 3 because `n` is at least 1.
   - Since `j` must be 0 for the first iteration, `j` must be initialized to 0 or start from 0.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The only condition we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes the first time is to set `j` to 0.

Given this analysis, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `dp[i]` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `j` is 0**
