Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s`: A string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `dp`: A list of integers with 101 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are 0.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the Condition for the First Execution of the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute for the first time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition (`1` to `n`).
   - Specifically, when `i` equals `1`.

4. **Initial Values for the Loop Head:**
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be 1.
   - The value of `n` should still be as it was before the loop, but since we're focusing on the first execution, `n` is not changing.

5. **State of Other Variables:**
   - The values of `s` and `dp` do not directly affect whether the loop executes. However, they remain unchanged during the loop initialization.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 1, and `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n`).

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the first execution of the loop is:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
