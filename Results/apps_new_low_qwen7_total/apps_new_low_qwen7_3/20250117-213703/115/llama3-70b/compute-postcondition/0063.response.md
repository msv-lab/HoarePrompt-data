Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the loop to execute for the first time.

### Initial States
- `i` is `n-2`
- `j` is `m-2`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2
- The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'
- The list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied
- The length of `ops` is printed

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over the list `ops`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **List `ops`**: For the loop to execute even once, the list `ops` must contain at least one element. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

2. **First Element in `ops`**: To determine the state of the objects in the loop head, we need to consider the first element in `ops`. Let's denote this element as `(i', j')`. 

3. **Condition for First Element**: The first element `(i', j')` in `ops` must satisfy the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))`.

4. **Matrix `A`**: Given that the first row and first column of `A` contain at least one '1', there must be at least one position in the first row or first column that satisfies the condition. However, since we are iterating from `(i, j) = (n-2, m-2)`, the first element `(i', j')` in `ops` might not necessarily be in the first row or first column but still must satisfy the condition.

5. **Variables `i` and `j`**: Since `i` and `j` are set to `n-2` and `m-2` respectively, they represent the starting position of the first valid operation. These values do not directly affect the condition within the loop but they define the starting point for the operations.

### Conclusion

For the loop to execute at least once, the list `ops` must contain at least one element that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time must include:

- `ops` is a non-empty list
- The first element `(i', j')` in `ops` satisfies the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))`

### Final State

State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, the first element `(i', j')` in `ops` satisfies the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))`**
