The `continue` statement in the provided code does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions given in the initial state. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Given that the initial conditions remain unchanged, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` now includes the tuples `(2, m - 1)` and possibly `(2, m)`, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` remains true.**
