`ops` is a list that contains tuples, and it appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to itself. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`. After executing the code, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` which is `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` or `(1, 2)` will be appended to `ops`. Therefore, the updated list `ops` will be `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', `ops` is `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`, and if any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`.**
