Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2). If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, `ops` remains unchanged. If the condition is false, `ops` also remains unchanged.***
