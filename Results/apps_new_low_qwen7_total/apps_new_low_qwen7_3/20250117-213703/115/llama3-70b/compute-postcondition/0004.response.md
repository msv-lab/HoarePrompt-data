The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the following condition is true: A[0][0] == 1 and A[0][1] == 1 and (A[0][1] == 1) and (A[1][1] == 1)**
