Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2. If the condition (A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1) is true, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the condition remains true as well.***
