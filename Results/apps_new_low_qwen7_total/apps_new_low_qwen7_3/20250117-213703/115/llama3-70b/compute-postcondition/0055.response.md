The code appends `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `(i + 1, j + 1)` becomes `(3, 3)`. The value of `ops` will now contain the elements (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3)**
