The code appends `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains the element (3, 1). The condition (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)) is not specified to affect the outcome, so no changes are made to the existing elements in `ops`. 

The new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` translates to `(3, 2)` because `i + 1` is 3 and `j + 1` is 2. Therefore, the `ops` list now contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `ops` contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2)**
