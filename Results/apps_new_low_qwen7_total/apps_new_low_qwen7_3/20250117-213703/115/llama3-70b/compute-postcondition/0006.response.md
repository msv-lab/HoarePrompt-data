Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the first row and first column of A contain at least one '1', and the current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`***
