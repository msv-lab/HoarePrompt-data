The `continue` statement in a loop would skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `m`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2)**
