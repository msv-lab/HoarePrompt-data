Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0. The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'. If any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`. The list `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`. If none of the specified elements is '1', the postcondition remains unchanged.***
