The `continue` statement is encountered within the loop, which causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration without executing any code in the loop body following the `continue` statement. This does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `m`, the matrix `A`, or the list `ops`. The values of these variables remain the same as they were at the start of the current iteration.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', if any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`, the list `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`.**
