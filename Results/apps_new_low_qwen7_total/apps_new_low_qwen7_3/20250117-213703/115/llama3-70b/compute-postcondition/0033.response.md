Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined by `j in range(m - 1)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is `m - 1`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'
   - The list `ops` now includes the tuples `(2, m - 1)` and possibly `(2, m)`
   - The condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` remains true.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. After the previous iteration, `j` was `m - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was `m - 1` and the loop continues, `j` must be decreased by 1 to `m - 2`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `i`, `n`, `A`, and `ops` are not directly affected by the loop condition itself, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` now includes the tuples `(2, m - 1)` and possibly `(2, m)`, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` remains true.**
