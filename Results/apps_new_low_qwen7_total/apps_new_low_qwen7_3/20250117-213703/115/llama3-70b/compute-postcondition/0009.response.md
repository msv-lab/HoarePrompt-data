Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for j in range(m - 1):` will execute as long as `j < m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'.
   - If any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`.
   - The list `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`.
   - If none of the specified elements is '1', the postcondition remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` and the condition for the loop is `j < m - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 1.
   - The conditions involving `i`, `n`, `m`, and the matrix `A` and list `ops` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - The matrix `A` and the list `ops` remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', if any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`, the list `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`.
