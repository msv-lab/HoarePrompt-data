The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, we assume that the `continue` statement is within a loop that was previously defined in the code but not shown here. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` now includes the tuple `(2, m - 1)`, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` remains true.**
