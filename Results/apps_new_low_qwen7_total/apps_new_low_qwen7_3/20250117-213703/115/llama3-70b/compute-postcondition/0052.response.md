Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(m - 1):`. Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `ops` contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2).

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1, so the loop is about to start the next iteration where `j` will be incremented to 2.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` becomes 2.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- `ops` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1) and (3, 2)**
