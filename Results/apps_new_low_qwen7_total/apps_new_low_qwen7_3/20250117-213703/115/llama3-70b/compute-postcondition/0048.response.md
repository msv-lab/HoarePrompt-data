The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, the provided code does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since the context of the loop is not given, we will assume that the `continue` statement is part of a loop where the conditions and variables are as described in the initial state.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, no variables are modified or new conditions are introduced by the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement simply moves to the next iteration of the loop without changing the values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and the condition (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)) may be true; `ops` contains the element (3, 1)**
