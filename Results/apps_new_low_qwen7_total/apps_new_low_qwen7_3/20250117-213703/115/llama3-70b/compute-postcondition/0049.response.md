Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and the condition (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)) may be true; `ops` contains the element (3, 1). If the condition A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1) is true, then no changes are made. If the condition is false, no changes are made either.**
