`ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` is 1 and `j` is `m - 2`. Therefore, the tuple added to `ops` will be `(1 + 1, (m - 2) + 1)` which simplifies to `(2, m - 1)`.

The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and the condition checks remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, and the if condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is true; the list `ops` now includes the tuple `(2, m - 1)`.**
