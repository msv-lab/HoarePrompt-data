The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this context, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement here implies that the program continues to execute the next line of code after the loop or conditional block it is within, without changing the values of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `m-2`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is greater than 0
- The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'
- The list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied
- The condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true

Since `continue` does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true.**
