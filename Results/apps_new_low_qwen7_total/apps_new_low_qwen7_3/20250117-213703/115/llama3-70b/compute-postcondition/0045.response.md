The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, so the tuple appended to `ops` is `(3, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; the condition (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)) is true; `ops` contains the element (3, 1)**
