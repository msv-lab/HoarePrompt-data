The code snippet prints `-1`. This action does not affect any variable's value or state. The conditions and values of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied, and the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, and -1 is printed.**
