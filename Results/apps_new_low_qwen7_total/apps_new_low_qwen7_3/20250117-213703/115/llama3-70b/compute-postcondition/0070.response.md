Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ops` is an empty list and the matrix `A` remains unchanged.**
