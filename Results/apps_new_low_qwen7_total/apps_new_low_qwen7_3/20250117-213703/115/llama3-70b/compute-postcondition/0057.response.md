Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1), (3, 2).**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop runs over `range(m - 1)`, meaning it iterates `m - 1` times.
   - The loop increments `j` starting from 0 up to `m - 2`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `i` starts at 2 and remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `n` remains constant and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `m - 1`.
   - `m` remains constant and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `ops` is a list that appends `(i + 1, j + 1)` if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `m - 1` because the loop runs `m - 1` times.
   - `ops` will contain the elements `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)` regardless of the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` as long as they are not all zeros simultaneously for the entire range. If all are zero, `ops` remains empty.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The initial state specifies `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` iterates from 0 to `m - 1`, so after the loop, `j` is `m - 1`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 2 and remains unchanged.
   - `ops` will always contain `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)` because the conditions for appending these elements are met in the given example and are independent of further iterations since `j` reaches `m - 1`.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is as described.
