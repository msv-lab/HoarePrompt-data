The code prints the first element of the list `ops`, which is a tuple `(i', j')`. The variables `i'` and `j'` are part of the tuple stored at index 0 of the list `ops`. The print statement does not modify any variables but simply outputs their values.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, the first element of `ops` is printed, the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))` still holds.**
