Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is -1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'.
   - The list `ops` includes all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied.
   - The loop terminates because `j` is no longer within the valid range (i.e., `j` is less than 0).

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to adjust these variables.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` becomes 2, `i` would still be less than `n - 1` (assuming `n` is at least 3).

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**.
