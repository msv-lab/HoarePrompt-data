Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', if any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1', then the current values of these elements satisfy the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))`, the list `ops` contains `[(1, 1)]`. If `A[0][1] == 1` and `A[1][1] == 1` and `A[0][2] == 1` and `A[1][2] == 1`, the condition is satisfied and the operations in `ops` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and the operations in `ops` remain unchanged.**
