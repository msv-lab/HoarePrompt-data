Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ops` contains the elements (3, 1), (3, 2). If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, no change is made to these variables. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
