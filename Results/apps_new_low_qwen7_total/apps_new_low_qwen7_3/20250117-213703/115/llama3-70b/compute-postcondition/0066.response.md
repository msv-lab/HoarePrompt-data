The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first and second elements of the list `op`. The second element of `op` was already printed in the initial state, so it does not change. The first element of `op` is also printed, but its value remains unchanged. The condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))` still holds as mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, the second element of `ops` is printed, the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))` still holds**
