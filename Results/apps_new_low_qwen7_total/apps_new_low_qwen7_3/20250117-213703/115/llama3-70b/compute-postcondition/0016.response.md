Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. The condition inside the if statement checks if the elements A[0][2], A[1][2], A[0][3], and A[1][3] are all equal to 1. If true, the state remains unchanged. If false, the state also remains unchanged since there is no else part modifying the variables.***
