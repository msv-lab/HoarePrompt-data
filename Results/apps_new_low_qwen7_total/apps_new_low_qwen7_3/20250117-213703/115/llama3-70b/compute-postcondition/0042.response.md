The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to, nor does it provide enough context to determine the exact behavior of the loop. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are modified within the scope of this `continue` statement, the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2. The condition (A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1) is true.**
