The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it works with an `$n \times m$` matrix `A`, where $n$ and $m$ are integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and each element of the matrix is either $0$ or $1$. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified.

However, since the problem does not specify what the function returns directly without additional context about the conditions or operations to be performed on the matrix, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.
