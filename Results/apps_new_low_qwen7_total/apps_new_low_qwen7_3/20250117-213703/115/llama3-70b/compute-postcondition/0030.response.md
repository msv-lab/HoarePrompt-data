Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` now includes the tuple `(2, m - 1)`, and the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` remains true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
