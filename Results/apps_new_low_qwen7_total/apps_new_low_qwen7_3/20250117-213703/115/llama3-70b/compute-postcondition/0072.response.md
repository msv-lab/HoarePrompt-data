Functionality: **The function processes an \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are integers between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies positions in the matrix where four adjacent 1s form a square or two horizontal/vertical lines of 1s. For each identified position, it adds the coordinates \((i+1, j+1)\) to a list `ops`. If the number of such positions exceeds 2500, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the count of positions in `ops` followed by the coordinates of these positions. If no such positions are found, the matrix \(A\) remains unchanged.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the matrix \(A\) does not contain any 1s, the function will still iterate over the matrix, but since no valid positions are found, the list `ops` will remain empty, and the function will print 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the program state after the for loop includes `i` being `n-2` and `j` being `m-2`. However, the code does not explicitly update `i` and `j` within the loop, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about their final values if the loop completes. This is more of a potential issue in understanding the flow rather than a missing functionality in terms of what the function ultimately achieves.
