Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'. The condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied if any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is '1'. If the condition is satisfied, `ops` becomes `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged.***
