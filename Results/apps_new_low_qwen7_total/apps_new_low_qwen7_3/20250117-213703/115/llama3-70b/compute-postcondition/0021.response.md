Let's analyze the given loop and the initial states step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is `m-1`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - The matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'
   - The list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from 0 up to `m-2` (since `range(m-1)` generates values from 0 to `m-2`).
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(m - 1)`.
   - The current value of `j` is `m-1`.

4. **Condition for First Iteration**:
   - To enter the loop, `j` must be less than `m-1` initially.
   - However, since the initial value of `j` is `m-1`, this would make `j` equal to the upper bound of the range, causing the loop to skip the first iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `j` must be initialized to a value less than `m-1` but still satisfy the condition that it should start from the second-to-last column.
   - Given the constraints, the only way to ensure the loop executes the first time is to initialize `j` to `m-2`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` must be `m-2` to ensure the loop executes the first time.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - The matrix `A` and the list `ops` remain as described.

Therefore, the modified state for the loop head to ensure the loop executes the first time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied.**
