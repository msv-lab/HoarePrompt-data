`The 'continue' statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration without terminating the loop. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0**
