`ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial values of `i` and `j` (where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2), the tuple `(0 + 1, 2 + 1)` which is `(1, 3)` will be appended to `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` themselves do not change, and the condition inside the if statement does not affect the variables or the value of `ops`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `ops` is `[('1', '3')]`**
