The given code block reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, representing the dimensions of an \( n \times m \) matrix `A`. It then creates the matrix `A` by taking input for each row. After that, it initializes an empty list `ops`. However, the code does not modify any of the existing variables or perform any operations with them; it simply reads data and stores it.

Given the initial state where \( n \) and \( m \) are integers such that \( 2 \le n, m \le 50 \), and \( A \) is an \( n \times m \) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, we need to represent the final state after executing the code block.

Since no modifications are made to the initial state (except for reading the values of \( n \) and \( m \) and creating the matrix \( A \)), the output state will still reflect the initial conditions but with the additional information that \( A \) is now populated with the specified dimensions and elements.

Final Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, A is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, ops is an empty list**
