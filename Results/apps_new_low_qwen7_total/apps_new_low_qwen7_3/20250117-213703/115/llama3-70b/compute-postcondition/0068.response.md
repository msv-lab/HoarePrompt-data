The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. This does not change the values of any variables, it only outputs them. The conditions and lists mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, the third element of `ops` is about to be processed, the condition `(A[i'][j'] == 1 or A[i' + 1][j'] == 1 or A[i'][j' + 1] == 1 or (A[i' + 1][j' + 1] == 1))` still holds, `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed**
