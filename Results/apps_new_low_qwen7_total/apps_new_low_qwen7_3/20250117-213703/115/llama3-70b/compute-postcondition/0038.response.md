Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than 0, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', the list `ops` includes all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied, and the loop terminates because `j` is no longer within the valid range (i.e., `j` is less than 0).**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `m-1` down to 0.
   - The loop continues if the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is met.
   - Otherwise, it appends the current position `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops` if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - **Invariant Variables**: `i` starts at 1 and does not change; `n` remains unchanged.
   - **Variable `j`**: Starts at `m-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.
   - **Variable `ops`**: Appends valid positions as described in the loop body.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is non-negative.
   - Each time the loop iterates, it checks if the specified condition is met. If so, it continues to the next iteration without appending to `ops`.
   - If the condition is not met, it appends the current position `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop, `j` becomes -1, meaning all possible positions have been checked.
   - The list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i + 1, j + 1)` as described by the problem statement.
   - The matrix `A` still has the first row and first column containing at least one '1' as given in the initial state.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described in the output state.
