Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(m - 1)`. The key variables here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine Initial State of Loop Variables**:
   - At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0 (as per typical behavior of the `range` function in Python).
   - The condition `for j in range(m - 1)` implies that `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Current State Before Loop**:
   - `i` is 0 (though this is not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop either).

4. **Required Conditions for the First Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `m - 1` must be greater than 0. This means `m` must be at least 1.
   - At the start of the loop, `j` should be 0.

Given the above points, we can conclude the required conditions for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
