Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input and then constructs matrix \( A \) by reading \( n \) lines of \( m \) integers each. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices starting from index \( (1, 1) \) to \( (n-1, m-1) \).
   - For each submatrix, it checks if there is at least one element that needs to be set to 1. This check is correct.
   - If any element in the current \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix needs to be 1, the program appends the coordinates \( (i+1, j+1) \) to the list `ops`. This ensures that we only add operations where the submatrix needs to be changed.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, the program checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operation in the required format. This also aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no operations are needed (as seen in the third example) by printing 0 operations.
   - It correctly handles cases where making the matrix equal to \( A \) requires more than 2500 operations by printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) and provides the correct output format.

Correctness: **True**
