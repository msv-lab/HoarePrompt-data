You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$

                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1', and the list `ops` contains all valid positions `(i+1, j+1)` where the condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1))` is satisfied.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ops is an empty list, i is n-2, j is m-2, A remains unchanged.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, the matrix `A` has the first row and first column containing at least one '1'. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ops` is an empty list and the matrix `A` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are integers between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies positions in the matrix where four adjacent 1s form a square or two horizontal/vertical lines of 1s. For each identified position, it adds the coordinates \((i+1, j+1)\) to a list `ops`. If the number of such positions exceeds 2500, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the count of positions in `ops` followed by the coordinates of these positions. If no such positions are found, the matrix \(A\) remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) for every potential case. Specifically, the program checks if there are any \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices in \( A \) that do not need to be modified and skips those. However, it does not ensure that all necessary \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices are modified if they need to be.

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

The expected output would be to transform matrix \( B \) to match matrix \( A \), which requires the following operations:
```
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 0 1
```

However, the program will not detect the need to modify the middle row and column to achieve this transformation. It will skip the middle \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix because none of its elements are 1, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where there are isolated 1s that need to be part of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix, making it incorrect for some inputs.
