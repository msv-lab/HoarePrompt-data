### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements and the annotated code to verify its correctness.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
- It then constructs matrix \( A \) by reading \( n \) lines of \( m \) integers each.
- This part is correct.

#### Operation Logic:
- The program iterates over all possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices starting from index \( (1, 1) \) to \( (n-1, m-1) \).
- For each submatrix, it checks if any element in the submatrix is `1`.
  - The conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` ensure that the submatrix has at least one `1` in it.
- If any of these conditions are met, the program appends the coordinates \( (i + 1, j + 1) \) to the list `ops`.
  - This logic is flawed because it only checks for a single `1` within the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix, but the requirement is to check if all four elements need to be set to `1` to match \( A \).

#### Output Handling:
- After processing all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, the program checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500.
  - If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
- Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operation in the required format.
  - This part is correct as per the problem statement.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where no operations are needed by printing 0 operations.
- It correctly handles cases where making the matrix equal to \( A \) requires more than 2500 operations by printing `-1`.
  - This part is correct.

### Key Issue:
The main issue lies in the condition for appending operations to the list `ops`. The program only checks if any single element in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix is `1`, but the problem requires setting all four elements in the submatrix to `1` to match \( A \).

### Corrected Condition:
To fix this, the program should check if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are `1` before appending the coordinates to `ops`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment incorrectly assumed that the program checks for all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix being `1`, which is not the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed condition check.

Final: **False**
