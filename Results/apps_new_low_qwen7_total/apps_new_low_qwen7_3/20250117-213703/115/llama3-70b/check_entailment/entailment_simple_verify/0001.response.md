### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem requirements and the annotated code.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input and then constructs matrix \( A \) by reading \( n \) lines of \( m \) integers each. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices starting from index \( (1, 1) \) to \( (n-1, m-1) \).
   - For each submatrix, it checks if there is at least one element that needs to be set to 1. This check is **incorrect**. The condition `if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:` is only checking if all four elements in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already 1, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, it should check if at least one element in the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix needs to be set to 1.

   - The correct condition should be:
     ```python
     if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
         ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
     ```

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, the program checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operation in the required format. This also aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no operations are needed (as seen in the third example) by printing 0 operations.
   - It correctly handles cases where making the matrix equal to \( A \) requires more than 2500 operations by printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \). Specifically, the condition inside the nested loops is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was correct because it missed the critical error in the condition used to determine when to append operations to the list.

**Final:** **False**
