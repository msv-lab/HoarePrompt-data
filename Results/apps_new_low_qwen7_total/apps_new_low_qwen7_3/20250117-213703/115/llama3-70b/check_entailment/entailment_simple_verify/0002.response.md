### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its logic to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input and then constructs matrix \( A \) by reading \( n \) lines of \( m \) integers each. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices starting from index \( (1, 1) \) to \( (n-1, m-1) \).
   - For each submatrix, it checks if there is at least one element that needs to be set to 1. This check is correct.
   - However, the check inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:` is used to skip setting the entire \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to 1 if all four elements are already 1. This is correct.

   - The condition `if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:` is used to append the coordinates to the list `ops` if any of the four elements need to be set to 1. This is also correct.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, the program checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operation in the required format. This also aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no operations are needed (as seen in the third example) by printing 0 operations.
   - It correctly handles cases where making the matrix equal to \( A \) requires more than 2500 operations by printing `-1`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic that can lead to incorrect results. The program assumes that performing operations in the order specified by the loop will always result in the desired transformation of matrix \( B \) to matrix \( A \). This is not guaranteed because the operations are performed in a fixed order, and the intermediate states of matrix \( B \) may not match the required configuration of matrix \( A \) after each operation.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- Matrix \( A \):
  ```
  1 1
  1 1
  ```
- The program would only need one operation to transform \( B \) to \( A \) (setting the entire \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix at indices (1, 1) to 1). However, if the program follows the current logic, it might generate multiple operations unnecessarily.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee the minimum number of operations and can produce incorrect sequences of operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) and provides the correct output format. The program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
