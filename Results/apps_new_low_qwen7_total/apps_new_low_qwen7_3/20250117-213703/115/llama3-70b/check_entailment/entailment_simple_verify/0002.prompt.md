You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):

If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ops` is an empty list and the matrix `A` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) from the input and then constructs matrix \( A \) by reading \( n \) lines of \( m \) integers each. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices starting from index \( (1, 1) \) to \( (n-1, m-1) \).
   - For each submatrix, it checks if there is at least one element that needs to be set to 1. This check is correct.
   - If any element in the current \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix needs to be 1, the program appends the coordinates \( (i+1, j+1) \) to the list `ops`. This ensures that we only add operations where the submatrix needs to be changed.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices, the program checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations followed by each operation in the required format. This also aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no operations are needed (as seen in the third example) by printing 0 operations.
   - It correctly handles cases where making the matrix equal to \( A \) requires more than 2500 operations by printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) and provides the correct output format.

Correctness: **True**
