Reasoning:

1. **Matrix Initialization and Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the matrices and initializes the matrix \(A\) with the given values. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Logic**: 
   - The nested loops iterate over all possible \(2 \times 2\) submatrices in \(A\).
   - For each position \((i, j)\), it checks if the current position or any of its adjacent positions (in the next row or next column) in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are '1'.
   - If any of these conditions are met, the position \((i+1, j+1)\) is added to the list `ops`.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - If the length of `ops` exceeds 2500, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to achieve the transformation within the allowed operations.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and each operation in the required format.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic in the nested loops might not cover all necessary conditions for transforming \(B\) to match \(A\). Specifically, it assumes that setting any single \(2 \times 2\) submatrix to all '1's will always be sufficient, which is not necessarily true.
   - The program does not consider cases where setting a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix might create conflicts or where the transformation cannot be achieved by any sequence of operations.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the logic implemented does not fully address all scenarios and might miss some valid transformations or fail to recognize when a transformation is impossible. However, the provided solution is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem but is not guaranteed to be correct in all cases due to the oversimplified approach.

Correctness: **False**
