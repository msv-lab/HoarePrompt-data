The function processes an \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are integers between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies positions in the matrix where four adjacent 1s form a square or two horizontal/vertical lines of 1s. For each identified position, it adds the coordinates \((i+1, j+1)\) to a list `ops`. If the number of such positions exceeds 2500, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the count of positions in `ops` followed by the coordinates of these positions. If no such positions are found, the matrix \(A\) remains unchanged.
