Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to divide the 2n players into two teams of n players each such that in every possible pairing of one player from each team, the player from the first team has a higher rating than the player from the second team, regardless of how the drawing is done.

Here's the key point:
- If we sort the ratings in ascending order, the first half of the sorted list represents the first team, and the second half represents the second team.
- For the first team to always win in any pairing, the highest-rated player in the first team must be higher than the lowest-rated player in the second team, the second-highest rated player in the first team must be higher than the second-lowest rated player in the second team, and so on.

Given the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] > team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads `n` and the list of ratings.
2. **Sorting Ratings**: It sorts the list of ratings in ascending order.
3. **Dividing Teams**: It divides the sorted list into two halves, assigning the first half to `team1` and the second half to `team2`.
4. **Checking Conditions**: It checks if for every index `i`, the `i-th` element in `team1` is greater than the `i-th` element in `team2`. This ensures that no matter which player from `team1` is paired with which player from `team2`, the player from `team1` will always have a higher rating.
5. **Printing Result**: If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

This logic correctly addresses the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
