Reasoning:
The annotated program provided describes a function that correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers representing the ratings of the chess players. This part is handled correctly by converting the input and splitting the ratings.

2. **Sorting Ratings**: The ratings are sorted, which allows for straightforward comparison between the two halves of the list.

3. **Team Formation**: After sorting, the first half of the sorted list (`ratings[:n]`) forms `team1` and the second half (`ratings[n:]`) forms `team2`.

4. **Condition Check**: The function checks if every element in `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If this condition is met for all `n` elements, it means that no matter how the drawing pairs the players, the player from `team1` will always win because the rating of the `team1` player is guaranteed to be lower than that of the `team2` player in every pair.

5. **Output**: If the condition is satisfied, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given that the logic within the function matches the requirements of the problem, the provided code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
