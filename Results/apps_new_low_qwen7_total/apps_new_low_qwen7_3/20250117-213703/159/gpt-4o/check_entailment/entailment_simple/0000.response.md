Reasoning:
1. The problem requires ensuring that for any pairing of players from two teams, the player from the first team always wins.
2. The provided solution divides the players into two teams based on their sorted ratings. Specifically, it places the top n rated players in `team1` and the bottom n rated players in `team2`.
3. After sorting the ratings, it checks if each player in `team1` has a lower rating than the corresponding player in `team2`.
4. If all players in `team1` have lower ratings than the corresponding players in `team2`, then for any random pairing, the player from `team1` will always have a lower or equal rating but never higher, thus ensuring they always win.
5. The logic correctly implements the necessary condition for the first team to always win regardless of the pairing.

Given this analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the required logic to determine if it is possible to divide the players into two teams so that the first team always wins in every pairing.

Correctness: **True**
