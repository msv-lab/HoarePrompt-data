You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())

ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))

ratings.sort()

team1 = ratings[:n]

team2 = ratings[n:]

possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
    if possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2*n integers, `team1` is a list of the first n elements of `ratings`, `team2` is a list of the last n elements of `ratings`, `possible` is a boolean value indicating if each element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If `possible` is true, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it does not print anything.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ratings and then checking if the first half of the sorted list is always less than the second half. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the teams are formed randomly after the division, and the condition for the first team to always win requires a more specific arrangement.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 5 4 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - Since the ratings are 3, 5, 4, 6, if we split them into teams [3, 4] and [5, 6], no matter how the pairs are drawn, the player from the first team will always win (3 vs 5, 4 vs 6). Thus, the output should be "YES".

- Program Output:
  - The program sorts the ratings to [3, 4, 5, 6] and checks if the first half [3, 4] is always less than the second half [5, 6]. This check passes, but the program does not consider the random pairing aspect, which means it incorrectly returns "YES" for this case.

- A More Correct Approach:
  - To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that for every possible pairing, the player from the first team has a higher rating than the player from the second team. One way to do this is to check if the highest n ratings are all higher than the lowest n ratings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    
    # Check if the highest n ratings are all higher than the lowest n ratings
    possible = all((team1[i] > team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if the highest n ratings are always greater than the lowest n ratings, ensuring that the first team will always win in every possible pairing.
