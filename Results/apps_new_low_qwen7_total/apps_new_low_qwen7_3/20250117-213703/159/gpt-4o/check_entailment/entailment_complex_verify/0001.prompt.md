You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Berland annual chess tournament is coming!

Organizers have gathered 2·n chess players who should be divided into two teams with n people each. The first team is sponsored by BerOil and the second team is sponsored by BerMobile. Obviously, organizers should guarantee the win for the team of BerOil.

Thus, organizers should divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each in such a way that the first team always wins.

Every chess player has its rating r_{i}. It is known that chess player with the greater rating always wins the player with the lower rating. If their ratings are equal then any of the players can win.

After teams assignment there will come a drawing to form n pairs of opponents: in each pair there is a player from the first team and a player from the second team. Every chess player should be in exactly one pair. Every pair plays once. The drawing is totally random.

Is it possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_2n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000).


-----Output-----

If it's possible to divide all 2·n players into two teams with n people each so that the player from the first team in every pair wins regardless of the results of the drawing, then print "YES". Otherwise print "NO".


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3 2 4

Output
YES

Input
1
3 3

Output
NO

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains 2·n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())

ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))

ratings.sort()

team1 = ratings[:n]

team2 = ratings[n:]

possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
    if possible :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2*n integers, `team1` is a list of the first n elements of `ratings`, `team2` is a list of the last n elements of `ratings`, `possible` is a boolean value indicating if each element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If `possible` is true, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it does not print anything.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of \(2n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). It then sorts these integers and divides them into two teams (`team1` and `team2`). The function checks if every member of `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding member in `team2`. If this condition is met, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' if such a configuration is not possible. The function handles the case where the input constraints are satisfied, but does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is out of the specified range (though it would raise an error in practice due to invalid input handling outside the function scope).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to divide the 2n players into two teams of n players each such that in every possible pairing of one player from each team, the player from the first team has a higher rating than the player from the second team, regardless of how the drawing is done.

Here's the key point:
- If we sort the ratings in ascending order, the first half of the sorted list represents the first team, and the second half represents the second team.
- For the first team to always win in any pairing, the highest-rated player in the first team must be higher than the lowest-rated player in the second team, the second-highest rated player in the first team must be higher than the second-lowest rated player in the second team, and so on.

Given the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ratings.sort()
    team1 = ratings[:n]
    team2 = ratings[n:]
    possible = all((team1[i] > team2[i] for i in range(n)))
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads `n` and the list of ratings.
2. **Sorting Ratings**: It sorts the list of ratings in ascending order.
3. **Dividing Teams**: It divides the sorted list into two halves, assigning the first half to `team1` and the second half to `team2`.
4. **Checking Conditions**: It checks if for every index `i`, the `i-th` element in `team1` is greater than the `i-th` element in `team2`. This ensures that no matter which player from `team1` is paired with which player from `team2`, the player from `team1` will always have a higher rating.
5. **Printing Result**: If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

This logic correctly addresses the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
