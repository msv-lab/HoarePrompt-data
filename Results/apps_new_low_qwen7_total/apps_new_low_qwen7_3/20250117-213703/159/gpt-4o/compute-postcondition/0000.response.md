The initial state is defined by the precondition as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- The second line contains \(2 \cdot n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\).

The code provided is:
```python
n = int(input())
ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
ratings.sort()
team1 = ratings[:n]
team2 = ratings[n:]
possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))
```

Let's break down the code step by step to determine the final state:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`.
2. `ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them to a list of integers. It then sorts this list in ascending order.
3. `team1 = ratings[:n]`: This line creates a sublist from the sorted `ratings` list containing the first `n` elements, which forms `team1`.
4. `team2 = ratings[n:]`: This line creates a sublist from the sorted `ratings` list containing the remaining elements, starting from index `n` to the end, which forms `team2`.
5. `possible = all(team1[i] < team2[i] for i in range(n))`: This line checks if every element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2`. If true, `possible` is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.

After running the code, the following will be the final state:
- `n` will be set to the integer input.
- `ratings` will be a sorted list of \(2 \cdot n\) integers.
- `team1` will be a sublist of the first `n` elements of the sorted `ratings` list.
- `team2` will be a sublist of the remaining elements of the sorted `ratings` list.
- `possible` will be a boolean indicating whether all elements in `team1` are strictly less than the corresponding elements in `team2`.

Since the exact input values are not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical example. However, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer, ratings is a sorted list of 2*n integers, team1 is a list of the first n elements of ratings, team2 is a list of the last n elements of ratings, possible is a boolean value indicating if each element in team1 is less than the corresponding element in team2**.
