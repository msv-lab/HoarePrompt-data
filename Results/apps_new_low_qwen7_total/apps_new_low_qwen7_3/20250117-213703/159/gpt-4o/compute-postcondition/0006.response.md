The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as shown in the provided code snippet. Instead, it seems to accept parameters through some external context or input that is not directly defined within the function definition itself. However, based on the constraints given, we can infer the expected input:

- An integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- The function also expects a sequence of \(2n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\).

Given the provided output cases are not directly related to the function's definition but rather describe potential return values, we need to focus on the parameters and their nature.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of \(2n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\).**
