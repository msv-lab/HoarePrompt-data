The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the print statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2*n integers, `team1` is a list of the first n elements of `ratings`, `team2` is a list of the last n elements of `ratings`, `possible` is a boolean value indicating if each element in `team1` is less than the corresponding element in `team2`, the print statement 'YES' is executed.**
