The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ratings` is a sorted list of 2*n integers, `team1` is a list of the first n elements of `ratings`, `team2` is a list of the last n elements of `ratings`, `possible` is a boolean value indicating if at least one element in `team1` is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `team2`**
