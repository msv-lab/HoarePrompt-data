The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of \(2n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). It then sorts these integers and divides them into two teams (`team1` and `team2`). The function checks if every member of `team1` is strictly less than the corresponding member in `team2`. If this condition is met, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' if such a configuration is not possible. The function handles the case where the input constraints are satisfied, but does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is out of the specified range (though it would raise an error in practice due to invalid input handling outside the function scope).
