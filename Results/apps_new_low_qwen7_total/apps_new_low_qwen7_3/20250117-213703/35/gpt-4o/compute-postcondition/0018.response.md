Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2}\right)\), and the loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True` at any point, `low` will eventually be updated to a value greater than \(\min(a, b) + 1\), otherwise, `high` will be updated to a value less than or equal to \(\min(a, b) + 1\) but still greater than or equal to `low`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low < high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, `high` is updated to `mid`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `a` and `b` are invariant; they do not change.
   - `low` starts at 1 and changes based on the conditions within the loop.
   - `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\) unless updated inside the loop.
   - `mid` changes with each iteration of the loop but is always between `low` and `high`.

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop performs a binary search-like operation to find a value where `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True` or to narrow down the range where it cannot.
   - The loop terminates when `low` is no longer less than `high`.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` ever returns `True`, `low` will exceed \(\min(a, b) + 1\), meaning the loop has found a suitable value for `n`.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a value, `high` will still be within the bounds defined by `low` and \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - The conditions provided match the behavior described, ensuring that the relationships hold throughout the iterations.
   - The final state confirms that `low` will be just above \(\min(a, b) + 1\) if a valid `n` exists, or `high` will reflect the upper limit of the search range.
