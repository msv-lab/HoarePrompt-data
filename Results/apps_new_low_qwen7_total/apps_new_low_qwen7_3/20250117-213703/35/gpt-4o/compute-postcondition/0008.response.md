The loop condition is `while low < high`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low < high` must still be true at the start of the next iteration. 

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\)
- `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `low` is either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\)
- `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\)
- `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\)

If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, `mid` remains unchanged. This means the values of `low` and `high` remain as they are, and the loop continues.

If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, `low` is updated to \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\) and `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `low < high` is still true. The key here is to ensure that the new value of `low` (if updated) is still less than `high`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, then `low` and `high` remain the same, and since `low` was initially set to either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\) and `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `low` is always less than `high`.

2. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, then `low` is updated to \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\) and `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\). Since \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\) is strictly less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\) (because \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\) is the ceiling of \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\)), the condition `low < high` still holds.

Therefore, regardless of the outcome of `can_distribute(mid)`, the loop condition `low < high` will still be satisfied, ensuring that the loop can execute one more time.

Thus, no changes need to be made to the states to ensure the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\)**
