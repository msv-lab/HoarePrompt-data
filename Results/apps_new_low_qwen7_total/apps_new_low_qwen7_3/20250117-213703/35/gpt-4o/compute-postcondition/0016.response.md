The code assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. This means that the previous value of `high` is now replaced by the current value of `mid`. The initial conditions and the value of `low` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\); `high` is equal to `mid`**
