The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b. The function returns the expression `a // x + b // x >= n`, where `a // x` is the integer division of `a` by `x` and `b // x` is the integer division of `b` by `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept an integer `x` and return the expression `a // x + b // x >= n`.
