`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `high` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the precondition that `low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\). Therefore, the Output State is: `low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\).

Output State: **`low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\)**
