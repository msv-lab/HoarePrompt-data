To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the possible changes to the variables within the loop head.

The loop condition is `while low < high:`. This means that for the loop to continue, `low` must be less than `high`.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\)
- `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `low` is either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\)
- `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\)
- `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\) or \(\left(\frac{3\min(a, b) + 6}{4}\right)\), and depending on the outcome of `can_distribute(mid)`, if `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, `high` remains as \(\min(a, b) + 1\); if false, `high` is set to `mid`.

Since the loop continues as long as `low < high`, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than `high` after the loop's execution.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Values of `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` can be \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\).
   - `high` is always \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

2. **Possible Adjustments:**
   - The loop will exit if `low` reaches or exceeds `high`.
   - For the loop to continue, `low` must remain less than `high`.

3. **Conditions After Loop Execution:**
   - `low` and `high` are updated based on the result of `can_distribute(mid)`.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, `high` is set to `mid`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than `high` after the loop's execution. Since `high` is fixed at \(\min(a, b) + 1\) unless `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, we need to ensure that `low` does not reach or exceed \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `low`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\)**
