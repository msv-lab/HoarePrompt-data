The code sets `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` was previously defined as `(low + high) // 2`, substituting the new value of `low` gives us the updated relationship between the variables. The condition that `low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\) remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is now `mid + 1`; `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), and `low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\).

Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`; `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\); `low` must be less than \(\min(a, b) + 1\)**
