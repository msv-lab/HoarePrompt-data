`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\). Since `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, the value of `mid` remains unchanged in terms of its expression, but `low` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\), and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`.**
