Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\); `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\) or \(\left(\frac{3\min(a, b) + 6}{4}\right)\), and depending on the outcome of `can_distribute(mid)`, if `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, `high` remains as \(\min(a, b) + 1\); if false, `high` is set to `mid`.**
