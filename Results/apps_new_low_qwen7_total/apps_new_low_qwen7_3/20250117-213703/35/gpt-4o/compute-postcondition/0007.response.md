Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is either \(1\) or \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\right)\). If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, `mid` remains unchanged. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, `low` is updated to \(\left(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\right)\) and `high` remains \(\min(a, b) + 1\).***
