Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function checks if the sum of the integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach might miss valid distributions where pieces from both cakes can be combined to meet the requirement.

Consider the input `n=5`, `a=3`, `b=2`. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate. In this case, one valid distribution could be having 2 pieces from the first cake and 1 piece from the second cake on each of two plates, and 1 piece from the first cake on the remaining three plates. This satisfies all conditions and results in a minimum of 1 piece per plate, but the current implementation would incorrectly return 0 since `3 // 1 + 2 // 1 = 5` which is equal to `n`, leading to no further reduction in `high`.

A correct approach would need to consider the combined distribution of pieces from both cakes to ensure the minimum number of pieces per plate is maximized.
