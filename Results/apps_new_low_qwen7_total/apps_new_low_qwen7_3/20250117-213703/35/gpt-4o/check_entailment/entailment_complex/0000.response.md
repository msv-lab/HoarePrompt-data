### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing pieces of two cakes onto \(n\) plates such that each plate gets at least \(x\) pieces of cake and the minimum number of pieces on any plate is maximized.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - Function `func_1` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \(x\) such that all plates can be filled with at least \(x\) pieces of cake.
   - The range for \(x\) is from 1 to \(\min(a, b) + 1\).
   - The binary search works by checking if a distribution is possible for the midpoint value of the current range (`mid`).
   - If a distribution is possible, it means we might be able to achieve a higher \(x\), so we move the lower bound up. Otherwise, we move the upper bound down.

3. **Helper Function `can_distribute`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least \(x\) pieces.
   - The condition `a // x + b // x >= n` ensures that the total number of pieces distributed (considering integer division) meets or exceeds the number of plates \(n\).
   - This condition is correctly implemented and checks the feasibility of the distribution for a given \(x\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The binary search approach correctly handles the boundary conditions and edge cases like \(x = 1\) (every piece goes into its own plate) and \(x > a + b\) (no feasible distribution exists).

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` and the helper function `can_distribute` together ensure that the solution is optimal and covers all required conditions.
   - There are no logical flaws or missing parts in the provided code that would make the program incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
