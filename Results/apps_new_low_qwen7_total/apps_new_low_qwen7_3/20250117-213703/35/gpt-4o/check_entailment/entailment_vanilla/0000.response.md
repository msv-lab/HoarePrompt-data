Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the `func_1` function correctly calculates the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. The binary search approach used in `func_1` is a good choice for finding the optimal \( x \).

1. **Binary Search Range**: 
   - The range for the binary search is correctly initialized as `(1, min(a, b) + 1)`. This is because \( x \) must be at least 1, and it cannot exceed the smaller number of pieces between the two cakes since each plate must contain at least one piece of each cake.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues until `low` equals `high`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - The `can_distribute(mid)` function is called to check if distributing the cakes with each plate containing at least `mid` pieces is possible.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, it means the current `mid` value might be feasible, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `can_distribute(mid)` returns `False`, it means the current `mid` value is too large, so `high` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - After the loop ends, `low - 1` is returned. This is the largest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` is true, which is the required \( x \).

4. **Helper Function `can_distribute`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake. It does this by verifying if the sum of the integer divisions of the total pieces of both cakes by \( x \) is greater than or equal to the number of plates \( n \).
   - This logic is correct as it ensures that if each plate gets at least \( x \) pieces, the total number of pieces distributed will meet or exceed the number of plates needed.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to be logically sound and should work correctly under the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
