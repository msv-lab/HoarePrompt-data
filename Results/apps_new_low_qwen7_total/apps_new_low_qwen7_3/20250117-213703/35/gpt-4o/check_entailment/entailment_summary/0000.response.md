Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine the maximum possible number \(x\) such that each plate will contain at least \(x\) pieces of cake. This involves ensuring that both the pieces of the cakes are distributed correctly among the plates according to the given constraints.
2. The provided solution uses a binary search approach in `func_1` to find the maximum \(x\) that satisfies the distribution requirements.
3. The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if a given \(x\) is feasible by verifying if the total number of pieces of both cakes divided by \(x\) is sufficient to cover all plates.
4. The binary search in `func_1` correctly narrows down the range to find the maximum feasible \(x\).

Given these points, let's analyze the provided functions:

- `func_1` performs a binary search to find the maximum \(x\) such that the condition in `can_distribute(x)` holds true. The search range is from 1 to \(\min(a, b) + 1\), which is appropriate because each plate must contain at least 1 piece and we cannot have more than the total number of pieces of either cake per plate.
- `can_distribute(x)` checks if the sum of the integer divisions of \(a\) and \(b\) by \(x\) is at least \(n\), which directly translates to the requirement that each plate gets at least \(x\) pieces of cake without violating the constraints.

Since the logic and implementation align with the problem statement and the provided execution summaries indicate that the functions handle all edge cases correctly, the overall solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
