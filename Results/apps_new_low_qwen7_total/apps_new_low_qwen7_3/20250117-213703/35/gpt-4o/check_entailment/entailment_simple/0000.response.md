Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake.
2. The binary search approach is used to find the maximum \( x \).
3. The function `can_distribute(x)` should check if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least \( x \) pieces. However, the current implementation of `can_distribute(x)` is flawed because:
   - It uses variables `a` and `b` directly without passing them as arguments, which means the function does not correctly reflect the state of the program when called within `func_1`.
   - The expression `a // x + b // x >= n` should be correctly evaluated, but since `a` and `b` are not passed as arguments to `can_distribute(x)`, the function cannot work as intended.
4. The main logic in `func_1` correctly performs a binary search to find the maximum possible \( x \).

Given the flaw in the `can_distribute` function, the overall correctness of the program is affected.

Correctness: **False**
