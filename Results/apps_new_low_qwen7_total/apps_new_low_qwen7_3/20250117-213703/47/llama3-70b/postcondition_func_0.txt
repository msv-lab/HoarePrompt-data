The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\). It then iterates through all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(y\) ranges from 1 to \(m\), counting the number of pairs where the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. After completing the iteration, it prints the total count of such pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing, but its output is the count of valid pairs.
