You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
After finishing eating her bun, Alyona came up with two integers n and m. She decided to write down two columns of integers — the first column containing integers from 1 to n and the second containing integers from 1 to m. Now the girl wants to count how many pairs of integers she can choose, one from the first column and the other from the second column, such that their sum is divisible by 5.

Formally, Alyona wants to count the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and $(x + y) \operatorname{mod} 5$ equals 0.

As usual, Alyona has some troubles and asks you to help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer — the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m and (x + y) is divisible by 5.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 12

Output
14

Input
11 14

Input
3 8

Input
5 7

Output
7

Input
21 21

Output
88



-----Note-----

Following pairs are suitable in the first sample case:   for x = 1 fits y equal to 4 or 9;  for x = 2 fits y equal to 3 or 8;  for x = 3 fits y equal to 2, 7 or 12;  for x = 4 fits y equal to 1, 6 or 11;  for x = 5 fits y equal to 5 or 10;  for x = 6 fits y equal to 4 or 9. 

Only the pair (1, 4) is suitable in the third sample case.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: x is n + 1, count is the total number of pairs (x, y) such that (x + y) % 5 == 0 for all x in the range from 1 to n and all y in the range from 1 to m, and m remains the same.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\). It then iterates through all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(y\) ranges from 1 to \(m\), counting the number of pairs where the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. After completing the iteration, it prints the total count of such pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing, but its output is the count of valid pairs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\), \(1 \leq y \leq m\), and \((x + y) \% 5 == 0\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).
   - For each pair, it checks if the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5 using the condition \((x + y) \% 5 == 0\).
   - If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where both \(n\) and \(m\) are as large as 1,000,000, which is within the constraints.
   - The program correctly counts all valid pairs without missing any or including invalid ones.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic implemented in the program matches the requirements of the problem.
   - There are no off-by-one errors or other logical mistakes.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
