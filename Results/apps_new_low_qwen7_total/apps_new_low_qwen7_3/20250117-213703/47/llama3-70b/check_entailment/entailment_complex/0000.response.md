Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input.
- It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
- It then iterates through all possible pairs `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from 1 to `n` and `y` ranges from 1 to `m`.
- For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if the sum `x + y` is divisible by 5 using the condition `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, it increments the counter `count`.
- After the loops complete, it prints the value of `count`.

Given the problem statement and the example test cases, the logic implemented in the program correctly counts the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n`, `1 ≤ y ≤ m`, and `(x + y) % 5 == 0`.

Correctness: **True**
