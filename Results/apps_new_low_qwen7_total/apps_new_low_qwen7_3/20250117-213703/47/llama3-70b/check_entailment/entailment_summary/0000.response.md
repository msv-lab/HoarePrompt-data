Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\), \(1 \leq y \leq m\), and \((x + y) \mod 5 = 0\). It reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the standard input, iterates through all possible pairs of integers within the specified ranges, checks if the sum of each pair is divisible by 5, and counts such pairs. The final count is then printed.

The solution follows the problem description accurately and handles the constraints properly. Since the program logic aligns with the requirements and there are no errors in the implementation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
