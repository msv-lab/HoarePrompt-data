The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are specified. However, given the constraints, it implies that the function might internally use variables `n` and `m` with the condition that both are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1,000,000.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal logic involving positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000.**
