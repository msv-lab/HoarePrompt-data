Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\). It then iterates through all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(y\) ranges from 1 to \(m\), counting the number of pairs where the sum \(x + y\) is divisible by 5. After completing the iteration, it prints the total count of such pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing, but its output is the count of valid pairs.**

This summary includes the following points:
- The function reads inputs `n` and `m` within the specified range.
- It iterates over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).
- It counts the number of pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x + y\) is divisible by 5.
- The function prints the count of these pairs after the iteration.
- The function does not return any value explicitly but provides the count through its output.
