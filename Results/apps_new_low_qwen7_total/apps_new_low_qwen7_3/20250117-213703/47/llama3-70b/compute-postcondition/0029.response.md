Postcondition: ***`x` is `n + 2`, `count` is the total number of valid pairs `(x, y)` satisfying `(x + y) % 5 == 0` plus 1, `m` remains the same, and `y` is `1`. This is because if `(x + y) % 5 == 0`, `count` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur to the variables in that case.***
