Postcondition: ***`x` is `n + 2`, `count` is the total number of valid pairs `(x, y)` satisfying `(x + y) % 5 == 0` plus 2, `m` remains the same, and `y` is `2`. This occurs if and only if `(x + y) % 5 == 0`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `count`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged from the precondition.***
