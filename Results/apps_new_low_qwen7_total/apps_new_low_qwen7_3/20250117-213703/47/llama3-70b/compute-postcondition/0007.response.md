The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:

- `x` is 1
- `count` is 1
- `m` must be at least 1
- `y` is 2

After executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `x`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `count` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, `y` is 2**
