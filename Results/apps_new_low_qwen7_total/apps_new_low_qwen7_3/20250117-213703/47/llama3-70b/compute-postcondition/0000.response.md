The initial state is that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000. The code snippet reads two integers from input, splits them using `map(int, input().split())`, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `count` is initialized to 0.

After running the provided code snippet, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on user input, and `count` will remain 0 since no operation is performed on it other than initialization. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1,000,000 still holds true.

Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000, count is 0**
