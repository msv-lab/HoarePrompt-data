The function accepts no parameters and processes an odd integer `n` between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) and a string `s` consisting of decimal digits where the first digit is 8. It calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` of length `n-11` starting from the beginning. Then, it compares this count with half of `(n-11)` (rounded down). If the count of '8's is greater than this value, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
