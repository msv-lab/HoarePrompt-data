The code snippet `print('YES')` prints the string `'YES'` to the console but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the output which is `'YES'`. The variables `n`, `moves`, and `count_8` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) minus 11, `moves` is \((n - 11) // 2\), `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring of `s` of length \(n - 11\) starting from the beginning, and `count_8` is greater than `moves`; printed output is 'YES'**
