Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes an odd integer `n` between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) and a string `s` consisting of decimal digits where the first digit is 8. It calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` of length `n-11` starting from the beginning. Then, it compares this count with half of `(n-11)` (rounded down). If the count of '8's is greater than this value, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is exactly 13, then `n - 11` would be 2, and the substring length would be 2. In this case, the function would check if there is more than one '8' in the first two characters of `s`. However, since the first character of `s` is always '8', the minimum count of '8's would be 1. Thus, the function would print 'NO' unless the second character is also '8'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation suggests that the program state includes `n` being an odd integer between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) minus 11, which is correct. However, it does not mention that `n` must be at least 13, which is an implicit constraint. Additionally, the annotation does not cover the case where `n` is exactly 13, as described in the edge case above.
