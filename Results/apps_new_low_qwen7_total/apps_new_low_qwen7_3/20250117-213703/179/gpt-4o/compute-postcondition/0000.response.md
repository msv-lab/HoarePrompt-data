Output State: **n is an odd integer between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) minus 11, moves is (n - 11) // 2, count_8 is the number of '8's in the substring of s of length n - 11 starting from the beginning**

Explanation:
1. The first line reads an integer from input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `n`. Given that `n` is initially an odd integer between 13 and \(10^5\), after this line, `n` will be reduced by 11, making it an odd integer between 2 and \(10^5 - 11\).
2. The second line reads a string from input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `s`. The string `s` starts with the digit '8'.
3. The third line calculates the number of moves by performing integer division of `(n - 11)` by 2 and assigns the result to `moves`.
4. The fourth line counts the occurrences of the digit '8' in the substring of `s` that starts from the beginning and has a length of `n - 11`, and assigns the count to `count_8`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `s` are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of the transformations applied by the code.
