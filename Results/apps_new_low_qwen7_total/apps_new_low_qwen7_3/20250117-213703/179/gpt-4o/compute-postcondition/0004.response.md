The code `print('NO')` does not change any variables or their values; it only prints a string. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) minus 11, `moves` is \((n - 11) // 2\), `count_8` is the number of '8's in the substring of `s` of length \(n - 11\) starting from the beginning, and `count_8` is less than or equal to `moves`; the string 'NO' is printed.**
