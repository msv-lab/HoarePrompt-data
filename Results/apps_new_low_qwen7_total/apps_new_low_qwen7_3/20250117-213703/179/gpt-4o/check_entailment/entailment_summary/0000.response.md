Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Vasya can guarantee a win by ensuring the final string is a telephone number (11 digits long, starting with 8).
2. The given solution checks if the number of '8's in the initial string `s` up to a certain point (`n-11` characters) is greater than half of the total moves needed to reduce the string to 11 characters.
3. This approach is flawed because it does not fully consider the strategic nature of the game. It only checks the immediate availability of '8's but does not account for the opponent's potential moves to prevent the formation of a valid telephone number.
4. To correctly determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to ensure that even after Petya's optimal moves, Vasya can still form a valid telephone number.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because it fails to consider the opponent's actions and the strategic aspect of the game.

Correctness: **False**
