You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no parameters and processes an odd integer `n` between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) and a string `s` consisting of decimal digits where the first digit is 8. It calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` of length `n-11` starting from the beginning. Then, it compares this count with half of `(n-11)` (rounded down). If the count of '8's is greater than this value, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Vasya has a winning strategy based on the given problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \) and the string \( s \).
2. **Moves Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of moves (\( \text{moves} = \frac{n - 11}{2} \)) Vasya and Petya can make until the string length reduces to 11.
3. **Count of '8'**: It counts the number of '8' characters in the initial part of the string \( s \) that will be removed (\( s[:n-11] \)).
4. **Winning Condition**: If the count of '8' characters is greater than the number of moves, Vasya can always ensure that at least one '8' remains in the final 11-character string, making it a valid telephone number. Otherwise, Petya can always remove '8' characters to prevent a valid telephone number from forming.

Given these steps, the program works correctly for all described scenarios and does not miss any edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
