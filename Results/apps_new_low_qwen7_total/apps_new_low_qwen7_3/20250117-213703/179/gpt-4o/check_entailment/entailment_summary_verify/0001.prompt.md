You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A telephone number is a sequence of exactly $11$ digits such that its first digit is 8.

Vasya and Petya are playing a game. Initially they have a string $s$ of length $n$ ($n$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player must choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string 1121, after the player's move it may be 112, 111 or 121. The game ends when the length of string $s$ becomes 11. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.

You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits.


-----Output-----

If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES.

Otherwise print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
13
8380011223344

Output
YES

Input
15
807345619350641

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number.

In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input().strip())
    s = input().strip()
    moves = (n - 11) // 2
    count_8 = s[:n - 11].count('8')
    if count_8 > moves:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no parameters and processes an odd integer `n` between 13 and \(10^5\) (inclusive) and a string `s` consisting of decimal digits where the first digit is 8. It calculates the number of times the digit '8' appears in the substring of `s` of length `n-11` starting from the beginning. Then, it compares this count with half of `(n-11)` (rounded down). If the count of '8's is greater than this value, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to analyze whether he can force the final string to start with an '8' after both players make their moves.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial string `s` has a length `n`, which is odd.
   - The game ends when the string length is reduced to 11.
   - Vasya and Petya take turns erasing one character each until the string is of length 11.

2. **Vasya's Winning Condition:**
   - Vasya wins if the final string is a telephone number, i.e., it starts with '8' and has exactly 11 digits.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of moves is `(n - 11)`.
   - Since the players alternate turns, Vasya makes the first move and the last move if `n - 11` is even, and Petya makes the last move if `n - 11` is odd.
   - To ensure the final string starts with '8', Vasya needs to make sure that after his moves, there are still enough '8's left in the string.

4. **Counting '8's:**
   - Count the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. This represents the '8's available for Vasya to use before Petya starts making moves.
   - If Vasya can remove enough characters such that the remaining '8's are more than the number of moves Petya can make, he can always ensure the final string starts with '8'.

5. **Algorithm Verification:**
   - The provided code correctly counts the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.
   - It then checks if this count is greater than half the total number of moves `(n - 11) / 2`.
   - If true, Vasya can guarantee a win; otherwise, Petya can prevent the string from starting with '8'.

Given these points, the provided solution logic aligns with the requirements and correctly determines if Vasya has a winning strategy.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the number of '8's available and the number of moves.
