### Reasoning:

To determine if Vasya has a winning strategy, we need to analyze whether he can force the final string to start with an '8' after both players make their moves.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial string `s` has a length `n`, which is odd.
   - The game ends when the string length is reduced to 11.
   - Vasya and Petya take turns erasing one character each until the string is of length 11.

2. **Vasya's Winning Condition:**
   - Vasya wins if the final string is a telephone number, i.e., it starts with '8' and has exactly 11 digits.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of moves is `(n - 11)`.
   - Since the players alternate turns, Vasya makes the first move and the last move if `n - 11` is even, and Petya makes the last move if `n - 11` is odd.
   - To ensure the final string starts with '8', Vasya needs to make sure that after his moves, there are still enough '8's left in the string.

4. **Counting '8's:**
   - Count the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`. This represents the '8's available for Vasya to use before Petya starts making moves.
   - If Vasya can remove enough characters such that the remaining '8's are more than the number of moves Petya can make, he can always ensure the final string starts with '8'.

5. **Algorithm Verification:**
   - The provided code correctly counts the number of '8's in the substring `s[:n - 11]`.
   - It then checks if this count is greater than half the total number of moves `(n - 11) / 2`.
   - If true, Vasya can guarantee a win; otherwise, Petya can prevent the string from starting with '8'.

Given these points, the provided solution logic aligns with the requirements and correctly determines if Vasya has a winning strategy.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy based on the number of '8's available and the number of moves.
