Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq n\) and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. It calculates and returns `ways`, which is computed as \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\). This computation involves the following steps:
1. Computes the factorial of `n`, stored in `fact_n`.
2. Computes the factorial of \(n - m\), stored in `fact_n_m`.
3. Calculates \(2^m \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
4. Multiplies the results from steps 1, 2, and 3, taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each multiplication to ensure the result fits within the specified constraints.
5. The function returns the computed `ways`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_1` correctly computes factorials for the given inputs. If `func_1` has issues or does not handle large numbers efficiently, it could lead to incorrect results or performance issues.
- The code does not explicitly handle the case when \(m = 0\). In this scenario, \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) would be \(\text{fact}_n\), and the expression simplifies to \(\text{fact}_n \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The code should still work correctly in this case, but this behavior is assumed rather than explicitly checked.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including its core computation and any potential edge cases.
