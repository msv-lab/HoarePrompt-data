The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. The function returns `ways`, which is computed as \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `n` and `m`, and return the value calculated as \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\).
