Given the code snippet and the initial state where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with `1 ≤ m ≤ n` and both less than or equal to 1,000,000, and considering `MOD` is defined as \(10^9 + 7\), let's analyze the code block:

```python
fact_n = func_1(n)
fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
```

Let's break down the impact of each line on the variables:

1. `fact_n = func_1(n)`:
   - This line calculates the factorial of `n` using the function `func_1` and stores it in `fact_n`.

2. `fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)`:
   - This line calculates the factorial of `n - m` using the function `func_1` and stores it in `fact_n_m`.

3. `ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD`:
   - This line computes the number of ways based on the given formula and stores the result in `ways`.
   - It first calculates \(2^m \mod \text{MOD}\).
   - Then it multiplies this result by `fact_n`.
   - Next, it takes the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact_n_m` modulo `MOD` (using `pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD)`).
   - Finally, it multiplies the results together modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute specific numerical values for `fact_n`, `fact_n_m`, and `ways`. However, we can describe the state after the code execution:

- `fact_n` and `fact_n_m` will be set to the respective factorials.
- `ways` will be the computed result using the given formula.

Therefore, the final output state, in terms of the variables that are modified, is:

Output State: **n is non-negative integer, m is non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, fact_n is the factorial of n, fact_n_m is the factorial of (n - m), ways is the result of the computation (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1)) mod (10^9 + 7))**
