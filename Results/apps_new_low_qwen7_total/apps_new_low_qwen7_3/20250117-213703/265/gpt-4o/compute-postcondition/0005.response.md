Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. This means the loop variable is `i`, and it starts from 2 and goes up to `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `result` is `result * 3 % MOD`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from 2 and increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be 4 (since `i` was 3).

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 4 and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Update the state**: We need to update the state of `i` to 4 and ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `result` is `result * 3 % MOD`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
