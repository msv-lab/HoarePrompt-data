`result` is updated to `result * i % MOD`. Given that `i` is 3, `result` was previously `result * 2 % MOD`, and now `result` is updated to `result * 3 % MOD`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `result` is `result * 3 % MOD`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
