The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the number of seats (and also the number of passengers since `m = n`). The function calculates the product of integers from 2 to `n` and then returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return the result of `(2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)`.
