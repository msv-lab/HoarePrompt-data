The initial state is `i` is 4, `result` is `result * 3 % MOD`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. The code updates `result` to `result * i % MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4
- `result` is `result * 3 % MOD`

After running the code:
- `result` is updated to `result * 4 % MOD`

So, the new state of `result` is now `result * 3 % MOD * 4 % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `result` is `result * 3 % MOD * 4 % MOD`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
