The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of `(2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)`. The function iterates through the integers from 2 to `n`, calculating the product of these integers modulo `10^9 + 7`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by starting the loop from 2, ensuring that the product is correctly initialized to 1 before the loop begins. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or negative, which would result in undefined behavior based on the current implementation.
