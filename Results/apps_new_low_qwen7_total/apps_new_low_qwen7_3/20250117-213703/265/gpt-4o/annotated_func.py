#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats (and also the number of passengers since m = n), and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result = (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns the result of (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of `(2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)`. The function iterates through the integers from 2 to `n`, calculating the product of these integers modulo `10^9 + 7`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by starting the loop from 2, ensuring that the product is correctly initialized to 1 before the loop begins. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or negative, which would result in undefined behavior based on the current implementation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #`The program returns ways which is computed as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1)) mod (10^9 + 7))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq n\) and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. It calculates and returns `ways`, which is computed as \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\). This computation involves the following steps:
1. Computes the factorial of `n`, stored in `fact_n`.
2. Computes the factorial of \(n - m\), stored in `fact_n_m`.
3. Calculates \(2^m \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
4. Multiplies the results from steps 1, 2, and 3, taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each multiplication to ensure the result fits within the specified constraints.
5. The function returns the computed `ways`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_1` correctly computes factorials for the given inputs. If `func_1` has issues or does not handle large numbers efficiently, it could lead to incorrect results or performance issues.
- The code does not explicitly handle the case when \(m = 0\). In this scenario, \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) would be \(\text{fact}_n\), and the expression simplifies to \(\text{fact}_n \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The code should still work correctly in this case, but this behavior is assumed rather than explicitly checked.
