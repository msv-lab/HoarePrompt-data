### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries to understand whether the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the factorial of a number `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- It correctly uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow for large factorials.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calculates the number of valid boarding sequences based on the given problem description.
- The formula used in `func_2` is:
  \[
  \text{ways} = (2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))
  \]
- Here, `2^m` represents the number of choices for each of the `m` passengers (they can choose either the front or the back entrance).
- `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`, representing the total number of ways to assign seats to `m` passengers if they all boarded from one side.
- `fact_{n-m}` is the factorial of `n-m`, representing the number of ways to assign seats to the remaining `n-m` passengers if the first `m` passengers have already chosen their seats.
- The inverse of `fact_{n-m}` is taken to account for the fact that the remaining seats are filled in a specific order.

Given the problem statement, the function `func_2` correctly captures the essence of the solution. Each passenger can choose either the front or the back entrance, and the remaining seats must be filled in a way that ensures no passenger gets angry. The formula correctly handles the combinatorial aspect of the problem.

The original assessment suggested that the code does not address the core requirement of counting valid boarding sequences based on the given constraints. However, upon closer inspection, `func_2` does indeed address this requirement. It correctly calculates the number of valid ways to assign and board the passengers without any of them getting angry.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
