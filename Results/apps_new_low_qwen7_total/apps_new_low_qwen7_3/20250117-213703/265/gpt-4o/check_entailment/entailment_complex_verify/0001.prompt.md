You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an airplane which has n rows from front to back. There will be m people boarding this airplane.

This airplane has an entrance at the very front and very back of the plane.

Each person has some assigned seat. It is possible for multiple people to have the same assigned seat. The people will then board the plane one by one starting with person 1. Each person can independently choose either the front entrance or back entrance to enter the plane.

When a person walks into the plane, they walk directly to their assigned seat and will try to sit in it. If it is occupied, they will continue walking in the direction they walked in until they are at empty seat - they will take the earliest empty seat that they can find. If they get to the end of the row without finding a seat, they will be angry.

Find the number of ways to assign tickets to the passengers and board the plane without anyone getting angry. Two ways are different if there exists a passenger who chose a different entrance in both ways, or the assigned seat is different. Print this count modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
3 3

Output
128



-----Note-----

Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either "F" or "B" for front or back, respectively).

For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F.

One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)
    fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
    ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
result = func_2(n, m)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats (and also the number of passengers since m = n), and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result = (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns the result of (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of `(2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % (10^9 + 7)`. The function iterates through the integers from 2 to `n`, calculating the product of these integers modulo `10^9 + 7`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the case where `n` is less than 2 by starting the loop from 2, ensuring that the product is correctly initialized to 1 before the loop begins. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or negative, which would result in undefined behavior based on the current implementation.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #`The program returns ways which is computed as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1)) mod (10^9 + 7))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where both are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq n\) and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. It calculates and returns `ways`, which is computed as \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\). This computation involves the following steps:
1. Computes the factorial of `n`, stored in `fact_n`.
2. Computes the factorial of \(n - m\), stored in `fact_n_m`.
3. Calculates \(2^m \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
4. Multiplies the results from steps 1, 2, and 3, taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each multiplication to ensure the result fits within the specified constraints.
5. The function returns the computed `ways`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `func_1` correctly computes factorials for the given inputs. If `func_1` has issues or does not handle large numbers efficiently, it could lead to incorrect results or performance issues.
- The code does not explicitly handle the case when \(m = 0\). In this scenario, \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\) would be \(\text{fact}_n\), and the expression simplifies to \(\text{fact}_n \mod (10^9 + 7)\). The code should still work correctly in this case, but this behavior is assumed rather than explicitly checked.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign seats and board the plane such that no one gets angry.
   - Each person can choose either the front or back entrance.
   - If their assigned seat is occupied, they will keep moving until they find an empty seat or reach the end, causing them to be angry.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For no one to get angry, each person must find their seat or an empty seat before reaching the end.
   - This means each person must choose an entrance that allows them to reach their seat without encountering all other passengers before them at the chosen entrance.

3. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - The problem can be solved using combinatorics and modular arithmetic.
   - The key insight is that the number of ways to assign and board the plane can be computed using factorials and powers of 2.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n)` computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the number of valid ways to assign and board the plane:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`.
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of `n - m`.
     - The number of ways is calculated using the formula: 
       \[
       \text{ways} = 2^m \times \frac{\text{fact}_n}{\text{fact}_{n-m}} \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This formula accounts for the choice of entrance (`2^m`) and the permutations of seat assignments.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example input `3 3` should yield 128 ways.
   - Let's verify the logic:
     - `fact_3 = 6`
     - `fact_0 = 1`
     - Number of ways = \(2^3 \times \frac{6}{1} \mod (10^9 + 7) = 8 \times 6 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 48 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 48\)
     - This seems incorrect; let's recheck the logic.

### Correctness:

The provided code seems to follow the correct mathematical approach but there might be an error in the implementation details. Specifically, the division operation in modular arithmetic needs careful handling.

Let's re-evaluate the formula and ensure the implementation is correct.

### Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly implement the formula due to potential issues with modular inverse calculation. A more robust implementation would use the modular multiplicative inverse to handle division in modular arithmetic.
