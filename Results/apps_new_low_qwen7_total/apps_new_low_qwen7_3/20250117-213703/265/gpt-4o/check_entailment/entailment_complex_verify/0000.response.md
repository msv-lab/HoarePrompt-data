### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the number of valid ways to assign and board passengers such that no passenger ends up without a seat. The key aspects are:
1. Each passenger has an assigned seat.
2. Passengers can choose either the front or back entrance.
3. Passengers will walk to their assigned seat and take the first available seat if their assigned seat is occupied.
4. If a passenger reaches the end of the row without finding a seat, they get angry.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It works correctly for small values of `n` but may face issues with large values due to the nature of the factorial function.
   
2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to compute factorials and powers.
   - It computes `2^m % (10^9 + 7)` and multiplies it with the factorials of `n` and `n - m`.
   - The formula used is \((2^m \times \text{fact}_n \times (\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}) \mod (10^9 + 7))\).

However, the key issue is that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate the boarding process correctly. They only compute factorials and powers without addressing the dynamic nature of the problem. Specifically, they do not consider the following:
- How passengers choose the entrance.
- The conditional logic for seating assignment and seat availability.
- The fact that each passenger's boarding path depends on the choices made by previous passengers.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic to handle the dynamic seating assignment and boarding process is missing. Therefore, the functions do not provide the correct number of valid boarding sequences.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the functionality of `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not validate the logic against the problem requirements.
- The annotated code does not mention any simulation or logic to handle the dynamic nature of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` only perform mathematical operations without simulating the boarding process or handling the conditional logic needed to determine valid sequences.

**Final: False**
