### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ways to assign seats and board the plane such that no one gets angry.
   - Each person can choose either the front or back entrance.
   - If their assigned seat is occupied, they will keep moving until they find an empty seat or reach the end, causing them to be angry.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For no one to get angry, each person must find their seat or an empty seat before reaching the end.
   - This means each person must choose an entrance that allows them to reach their seat without encountering all other passengers before them at the chosen entrance.

3. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - The problem can be solved using combinatorics and modular arithmetic.
   - The key insight is that the number of ways to assign and board the plane can be computed using factorials and powers of 2.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n)` computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2(n, m)` uses the results from `func_1` to compute the number of valid ways to assign and board the plane:
     - `fact_n` is the factorial of `n`.
     - `fact_n_m` is the factorial of `n - m`.
     - The number of ways is calculated using the formula: 
       \[
       \text{ways} = 2^m \times \frac{\text{fact}_n}{\text{fact}_{n-m}} \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This formula accounts for the choice of entrance (`2^m`) and the permutations of seat assignments.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example input `3 3` should yield 128 ways.
   - Let's verify the logic:
     - `fact_3 = 6`
     - `fact_0 = 1`
     - Number of ways = \(2^3 \times \frac{6}{1} \mod (10^9 + 7) = 8 \times 6 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 48 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 48\)
     - This seems incorrect; let's recheck the logic.

### Correctness:

The provided code seems to follow the correct mathematical approach but there might be an error in the implementation details. Specifically, the division operation in modular arithmetic needs careful handling.

Let's re-evaluate the formula and ensure the implementation is correct.

### Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly implement the formula due to potential issues with modular inverse calculation. A more robust implementation would use the modular multiplicative inverse to handle division in modular arithmetic.
