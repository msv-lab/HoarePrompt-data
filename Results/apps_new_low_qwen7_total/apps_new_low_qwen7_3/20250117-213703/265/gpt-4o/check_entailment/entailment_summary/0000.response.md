Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and split using the `input` function, and the necessary variables are extracted.

2. **Factorial Calculation**: 
   - `func_1` calculates the factorial of a given number `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This function works correctly for the range specified (up to 1,000,000), although it may have performance issues for very large values due to the iterative multiplication.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to calculate the factorial of `n` and `n-m`, and then uses these values to compute the number of ways to board the plane without anyone getting angry.

3. **Formula Used**:
   - The formula used in `func_2` is derived from combinatorial mathematics. Specifically, the formula accounts for:
     - \(2^m\): Each of the `m` passengers can choose either the front or the back entrance, leading to \(2^m\) possibilities.
     - \(\text{fact}_n\): The number of ways to assign seats to `m` passengers out of `n` seats.
     - \(\text{fact}_{n-m}^{-1}\): The modular inverse of \(\text{fact}_{n-m}\), which adjusts for overcounting in the assignment of seats.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of `pow(x, y, MOD)` correctly implements modular exponentiation, ensuring that intermediate results do not overflow.
   - The overall calculation respects the constraints of the problem, especially the modulo operation to keep the result manageable.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code implicitly handles the case when \(m = 0\), reducing to \(\text{fact}_n \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is correctly handled by the factorial function.
   - No explicit edge cases are mentioned, but the provided formula and modular arithmetic are generally robust for the given problem constraints.

Given the above points, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
