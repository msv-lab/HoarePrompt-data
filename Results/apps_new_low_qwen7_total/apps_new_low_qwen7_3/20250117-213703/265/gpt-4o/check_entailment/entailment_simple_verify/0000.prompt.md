You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an airplane which has n rows from front to back. There will be m people boarding this airplane.

This airplane has an entrance at the very front and very back of the plane.

Each person has some assigned seat. It is possible for multiple people to have the same assigned seat. The people will then board the plane one by one starting with person 1. Each person can independently choose either the front entrance or back entrance to enter the plane.

When a person walks into the plane, they walk directly to their assigned seat and will try to sit in it. If it is occupied, they will continue walking in the direction they walked in until they are at empty seat - they will take the earliest empty seat that they can find. If they get to the end of the row without finding a seat, they will be angry.

Find the number of ways to assign tickets to the passengers and board the plane without anyone getting angry. Two ways are different if there exists a passenger who chose a different entrance in both ways, or the assigned seat is different. Print this count modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Example-----
Input
3 3

Output
128



-----Note-----

Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either "F" or "B" for front or back, respectively).

For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F.

One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)
    fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)
    ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
result = func_2(n, m)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of seats (and also the number of passengers since m = n), and MOD is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: result = (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns the result of (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n) % MOD

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and both are less than or equal to 1,000,000. MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
def func_2(n, m):
    fact_n = func_1(n)

fact_n_m = func_1(n - m)

ways = pow(2, m, MOD) * fact_n % MOD * pow(fact_n_m, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
    return ways
    #`The program returns ways which is computed as (2^m * fact_n * (fact_n_m^(-1)) mod (10^9 + 7))`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the number of valid boarding sequences based on the given constraints.

- `func_1` calculates the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` attempts to calculate the number of ways to assign and board the passengers using factorials and powers, but it does not properly account for the dynamic nature of the problem.

The problem requires considering each passenger's choice of entrance and ensuring that no passenger ends up without a seat. However, the provided functions do not simulate the boarding process or handle the conditional logic needed to determine valid sequences.

A valid solution would involve simulating the boarding process and ensuring that each passenger finds a seat. This typically involves maintaining a state of available seats and processing each passenger's choice in a way that accounts for both the front and back entrances.

Since the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to correctly solve the problem, it is incorrect.
