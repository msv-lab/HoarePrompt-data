Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the number of valid boarding sequences based on the given constraints.

- `func_1` calculates the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` attempts to calculate the number of ways to assign and board the passengers using factorials and powers, but it does not properly account for the dynamic nature of the problem.

The problem requires considering each passenger's choice of entrance and ensuring that no passenger ends up without a seat. However, the provided functions do not simulate the boarding process or handle the conditional logic needed to determine valid sequences.

A valid solution would involve simulating the boarding process and ensuring that each passenger finds a seat. This typically involves maintaining a state of available seats and processing each passenger's choice in a way that accounts for both the front and back entrances.

Since the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to correctly solve the problem, it is incorrect.
