Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). 
   - For \(n\) up to 1,000,000, the factorial calculation itself would exceed standard integer limits, but the use of modulo ensures it stays within bounds.
   - The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each value and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to avoid overflow.
   - This approach is correct and efficient for the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` uses the result from `func_1` to compute the total number of valid boarding sequences.
   - The formula used is derived from combinatorial mathematics, specifically considering the choices each passenger makes (either entering from the front or back).
   - The term \(2^m\) represents the number of ways each of the `m` passengers can choose between two entrances.
   - The term \(\text{fact}_n / \text{fact}_{n-m}\) (using modular inverse) accounts for the permutations of passengers seated in their assigned seats.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the final result remains within the required bounds.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The input handling and parsing are correct, reading from standard input and splitting the data appropriately.
   - The main logic in `func_2` correctly implements the combinatorial solution for the problem statement.
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to be mathematically sound and correctly implemented.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
