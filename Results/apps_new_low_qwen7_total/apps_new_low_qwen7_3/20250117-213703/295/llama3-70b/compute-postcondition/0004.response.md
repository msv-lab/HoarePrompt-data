Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `True`, and `i` is `0`. If the condition inside the if statement is satisfied (all elements of `a` match the corresponding elements of `b` starting from index `(i + j) % 12` for \(j\) in the range of \(n\)), `f` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `f` remains `False` and `i` remains `0`.***
