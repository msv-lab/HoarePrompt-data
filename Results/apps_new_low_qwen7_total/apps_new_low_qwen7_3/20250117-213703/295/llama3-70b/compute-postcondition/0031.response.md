Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\); `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\); `f` is `True` if all elements in `a` match the corresponding elements in `b` starting from index \((i + j) \% 12\) for all `j` in range `n`; otherwise, `f` remains `False`; `i` is 12. If `i` equals 11 and `f` is `False`, the loop or statement is broken out of.***
