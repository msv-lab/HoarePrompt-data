The variable `f` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `True`, and `i` is `12`.**
