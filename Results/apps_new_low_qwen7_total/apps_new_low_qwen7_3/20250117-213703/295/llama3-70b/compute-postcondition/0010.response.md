Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `True`, and `i` is `11`. If the condition `(a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12])` holds for all \(j\) in the range \(0 \leq j < n\), then `f` remains `True`. Otherwise, `f` remains `False`.***
