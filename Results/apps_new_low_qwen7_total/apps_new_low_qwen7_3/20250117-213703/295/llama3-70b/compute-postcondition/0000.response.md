The initial state is defined as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 28 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 31

The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, and then creates a list `b` with specific values. It also initializes a boolean variable `f` to `False`.

Since the code does not modify the values of `a` or `b` further and only updates `n` and `f`, we need to ensure that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the code execution. The value of `f` is set to `False` but does not affect the list `a` or the list `b`.

Thus, the final output state will retain the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `f` will be `False`.

Let's denote the input as follows:
- `n` (input integer)
- `a` (list of `n` integers)
- `b` (list `[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]`)
- `f` (boolean, initially `False`)

Given this, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 28 ≤ a_i ≤ 31, b is a list [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], f is False**
