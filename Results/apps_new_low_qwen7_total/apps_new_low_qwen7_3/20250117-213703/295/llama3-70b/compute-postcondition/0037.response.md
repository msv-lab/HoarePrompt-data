Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `True` if any of the conditions within the loop evaluate to `True` when `f` is initially `True`, and `f` remains `False` when `f` is initially `False`, and the value of `i` is `12`. Additionally, if `f` is `True`, the print statement outputs 'YES'.***
