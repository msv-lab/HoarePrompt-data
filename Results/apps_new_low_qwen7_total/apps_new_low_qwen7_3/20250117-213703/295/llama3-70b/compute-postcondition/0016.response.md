Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), and `f` is `True` if all elements of `a` match the corresponding elements of `b` rotated by `i % 12`. Otherwise, `f` remains `False`.***
