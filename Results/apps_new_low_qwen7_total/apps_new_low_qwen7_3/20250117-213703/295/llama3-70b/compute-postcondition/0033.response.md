Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `True` if any of the conditions within the loop evaluate to `True`, otherwise `f` remains `False`, and the current value of `i` is `12`. Since the if condition checks if `f` is `True`, the postcondition is that `f` is `True`.***
