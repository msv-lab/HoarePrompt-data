Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `False`, and `i` is `11`.***

Explanation: Given the precondition, we know the initial states of all variables. The if condition `if (i == 11 and (not f)):` evaluates to true because `i` is `11` and `f` is initially `True`, but the condition inside the if statement requires `f` to be `False`. Since the condition is met, the postcondition reflects that `f` remains `False` while all other variables retain their initial states.
