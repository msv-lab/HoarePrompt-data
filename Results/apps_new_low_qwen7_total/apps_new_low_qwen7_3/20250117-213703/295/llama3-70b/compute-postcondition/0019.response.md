The code simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `f`. This changes the value of `f` from its previous state, which was `False`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), and `f` is `True`.**
