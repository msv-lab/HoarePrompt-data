The code sets the boolean variable `f` to `True`. This changes the value of `f` from `False` to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\); `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\); `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\); `f` is `True`; `i` is 12.**
