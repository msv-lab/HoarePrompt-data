Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `False`, `i` is `0`. The condition inside the if statement is satisfied, i.e., all elements of `a` match the corresponding elements of `b` starting from index `(i + j) % 12` for \(j\) in the range of \(n\).**
