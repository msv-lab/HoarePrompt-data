The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 24`, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies `28 ≤ a_i ≤ 31`. 

Case_1: If all elements in the list `a` are equal to 28, the function returns "All elements are 28".
Case_2: If all elements in the list `a` are equal to 31, the function returns "All elements are 31".
Case_3: Otherwise, the function returns the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of integers where each integer is between 28 and 31, inclusive, and has a length between 1 and 24. If all elements are 28, it returns "All elements are 28". If all elements are 31, it returns "All elements are 31". Otherwise, it returns the list `a`.
