Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is between 28 and 31, inclusive, and has a length between 1 and 24. It checks if the elements of the list `a` match any of the following patterns based on a predefined list `b` containing the number of days in each month: either all elements are equal to 31, or the elements follow the pattern of the days in a non-leap year. If any of these conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input length `n` exceeds 24. Although the annotation mentions \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), the code itself does not impose any restriction on the length beyond reading the input as an integer.
- The function also does not explicitly check for the case where the list `a` contains only the value 28, which would not be caught by the current logic. This means that if all elements in `a` are 28, the function will print 'NO', which might not be the desired behavior if such a scenario is expected.
- The function assumes that the input values are correctly formatted and within the specified range. However, no validation is performed to ensure that the input meets these constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid inputs are provided.
