Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(28 \leq a_i \leq 31\), `b` is a list \([31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\), `f` is `False`, and `i` is `11`. Since the condition `i == 11 and (not f)` always evaluates to `True` in the if part and there is no else part, `f` remains `False`.***
