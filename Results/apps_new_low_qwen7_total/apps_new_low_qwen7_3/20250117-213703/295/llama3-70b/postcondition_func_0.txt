The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is between 28 and 31, inclusive, and has a length between 1 and 24. It checks if the elements of the list `a` match any of the following patterns based on a predefined list `b` containing the number of days in each month: either all elements are equal to 31, or the elements follow the pattern of the days in a non-leap year. If any of these conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
