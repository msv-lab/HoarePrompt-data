Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`).
2. The logic inside the for loop checks if the sequence of days in `a` matches either the 12 months of a non-leap year or the 12 months of a leap year, considering the wrap-around from December to January.
3. The code correctly updates the flag `f` to `True` if a match is found and breaks out of the loop early if a match is confirmed.
4. After the loop, the code checks the value of `f` and prints 'YES' if a match was found, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
5. The conditions in the for loop handle both regular years and leap years appropriately, ensuring that the sequence of days in `a` can be matched to the sequence in `b`.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
