Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle leap years correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that February always has 28 days, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, February has 29 days in a leap year. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
31 29 31
```

The correct answer should be "YES" because the sequence could represent the months of July, February (leap year), and October. However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks against a fixed list of days without considering leap years.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to check for leap years and adjust the days accordingly.
