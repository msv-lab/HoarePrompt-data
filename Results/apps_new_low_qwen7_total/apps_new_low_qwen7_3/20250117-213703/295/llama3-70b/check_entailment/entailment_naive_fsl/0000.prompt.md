You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    f = False
    for i in range(12):
        if all((a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12] for j in range(n))):
            f = True
        if i == 11 and (not f):
            break
        if all((a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12] for j in range(n))):
            f = True
        if i == 11 and (not f):
            break
    if f:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
