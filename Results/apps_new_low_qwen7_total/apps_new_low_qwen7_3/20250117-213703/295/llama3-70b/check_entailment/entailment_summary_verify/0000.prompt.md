You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.

A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.

In this problem you are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check.


-----Output-----

If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).


-----Examples-----
Input
4
31 31 30 31

Output
Yes


Input
2
30 30

Output
No


Input
5
29 31 30 31 30

Output
Yes


Input
3
31 28 30

Output
No


Input
3
31 31 28

Output
Yes




-----Note-----

In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.

In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.

In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.

In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.

In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    f = False
    for i in range(12):
        if all((a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12] for j in range(n))):
            f = True
        if i == 11 and (not f):
            break
        if all((a[j] == b[(i + j) % 12 + 12] for j in range(n))):
            f = True
        if i == 11 and (not f):
            break
    if f:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is between 28 and 31, inclusive, and has a length between 1 and 24. It checks if the elements of the list `a` match any of the following patterns based on a predefined list `b` containing the number of days in each month: either all elements are equal to 31, or the elements follow the pattern of the days in a non-leap year. If any of these conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle leap years correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that February always has 28 days, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, February has 29 days in a leap year. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
31 29 31
```

The correct answer should be "YES" because the sequence could represent the months of July, February (leap year), and October. However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks against a fixed list of days without considering leap years.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to check for leap years and adjust the days accordingly.
