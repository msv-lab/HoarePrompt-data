Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`; additionally, `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x + 1, current_y)` with the value `i + 1` if the operation is 'R'. The overall state of the program retains the conditions stated in the precondition, with the specific update depending on the condition of the if statement.***
