The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. The initial state indicates that `final_x` and `final_y` change based on the value of `op`, but since the value of `op` does not affect the increment of `final_x` in this line of code, `final_x` will simply be increased by 1. The value of `final_y` remains unchanged according to the rules specified.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter), `final_x` is increased by 1, and `final_y` remains unchanged.**
