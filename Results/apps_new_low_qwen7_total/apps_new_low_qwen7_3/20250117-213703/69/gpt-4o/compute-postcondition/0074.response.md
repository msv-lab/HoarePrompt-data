The code updates the value of `position_map[current_x, current_y]` to `i`. This means that the dictionary `position_map` will now have the key `(current_x, current_y)` mapped to the value `i`.

The initial conditions are:
- `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`
- `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `position_map` contains at least the keys `(0, 0)` with value `-1`, and `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`

After executing the line `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i`, the value of `position_map[current_x, current_y]` changes from `i + 1` to `i`. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`target_pos` is current_x + dx, current_y + dy; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and i - position_map[target_pos]; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y) with the value i.**
