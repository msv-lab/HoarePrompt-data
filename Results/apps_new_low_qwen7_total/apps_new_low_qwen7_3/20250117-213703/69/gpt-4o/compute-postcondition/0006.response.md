`final_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `operations` is unchanged, and the value of `op` remains 'D' since the code only affects `final_y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'D', and `final_y` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'D', and `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
