`current_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` was `y - final_y`. Therefore, the new value of `current_y` is `y - final_y - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is the initial value of x, `y` is the initial value of y, `dx` is x - final_x, `dy` is y - final_y - 1, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is y - final_y - 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, `n` is greater than 0, `operations[i]` is 'D'**
