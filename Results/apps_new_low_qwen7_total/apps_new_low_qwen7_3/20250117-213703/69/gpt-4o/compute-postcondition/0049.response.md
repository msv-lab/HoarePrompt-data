The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. Given that `current_x` was initially 0, after executing this line, `current_x` will become -1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is the initial value of x, `y` is the initial value of y, `dx` is x - final_x, `dy` is y - final_y, `current_x` is -1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, `n` is greater than 0, `operations[i]` is equal to 'L'**
