The code `final_x -= 1` decrements the value of `final_x` by 1. Based on the initial state, the value of `final_x` is determined by the operations in the `operations` string. Since the code only affects `final_x`, the value of `final_y` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter), `final_x` is decreased by 1 based on the operations in the `operations` string, and `final_y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter), `final_x` is decreased by 1 based on the operations in the `operations` string, and `final_y` remains unchanged.**
