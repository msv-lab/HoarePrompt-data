`current_y` is incremented by 1. The value of `current_x` remains unchanged, and the value of `target_pos` is updated to `current_x + dx, current_y + 1`. The other variables and their conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`target_pos` is `current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + 1; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and `i` - `position_map[target_pos]`; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value `i` + 1**
