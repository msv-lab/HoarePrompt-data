`current_y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_y` is 0, so after the increment, `current_y` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the initial value of x, `y` is the initial value of y, `dx` is x - final_x, `dy` is y - final_y, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, `n` must be greater than 0, the current operation is 'U'.
Output State: **`x` is the initial value of x, `y` is the initial value of y, `dx` is x - final_x, `dy` is y - final_y, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, `n` must be greater than 0, the current operation is 'U'**
