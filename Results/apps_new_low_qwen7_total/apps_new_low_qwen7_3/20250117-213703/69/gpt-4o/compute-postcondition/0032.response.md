Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter). If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
