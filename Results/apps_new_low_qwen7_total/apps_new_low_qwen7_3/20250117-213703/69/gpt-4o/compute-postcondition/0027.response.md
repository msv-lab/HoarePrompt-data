`final_y` is incremented by 1 based on the initial condition that `operations` is a non-empty string and the operation is determined by the first character. The value of `final_x` remains unchanged because no operation affecting `final_x` was performed.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string, `final_y` is increased by 1, `final_x` remains unchanged**
