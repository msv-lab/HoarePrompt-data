The code `final_y -= 1` decrements the value of `final_y` by 1. The value of `final_y` was increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise. After executing this line, `final_y` is now adjusted by subtracting 1 from its previous value.

The value of `final_x` is updated based on the next `op`. It is decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'L', set to its initial value plus 1 if the next `op` is 'R', and remains unchanged otherwise. Since the code does not affect `final_x`, its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 2 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise, `final_x` is decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'L', set to its initial value plus 1 if the next `op` is 'R', and remains unchanged otherwise, `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
