Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is updated to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys `(0, 0)` with value `-1`, and `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`.***
