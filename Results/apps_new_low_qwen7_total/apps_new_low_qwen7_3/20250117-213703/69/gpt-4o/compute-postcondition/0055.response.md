Postcondition: ***`x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `dx` is `x` - `final_x`, `dy` is `y` - `final_y`, `current_x` is either 0 or -1 or 1, `current_y` is either 0 or `y` - `final_y` - 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, and `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is `y` - `final_y` - 1. Otherwise, `current_x` is either -1 or 1.***
