Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`. If `target_pos` is not in `position_map`, then the conditions regarding `min_length`, `n`, and `position_map` remain unchanged.***
