Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is `(x - final_x, y - final_y)`, `((x - final_x) - 1, y - final_y)`, `((x - final_x) + 1, y - final_y)`, or `(x - final_x, 2*y - 2*final_y - 1)` based on the value of `current_x` and `current_y`. `current_x` is either 0 or -1 or 1, `current_y` is either 0 or `y - final_y - 1`. `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`. `min_length` is infinity, and `n` is greater than 0. The current value of `target_pos` is in `position_map`.***
