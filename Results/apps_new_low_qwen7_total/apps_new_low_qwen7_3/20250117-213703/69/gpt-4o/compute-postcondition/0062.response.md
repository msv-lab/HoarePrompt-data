Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`. Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `target_pos` is in `position_map`.
   - `min_length` is updated to `i - position_map[target_pos]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`.
   - `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being incremented from its previous value, `i` will increase by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but based on the given information, it is still greater than 0.

4. **New State**:
   - `target_pos` remains in `position_map` (no change needed here).
   - `min_length` will be updated again based on the new value of `i` and `position_map[target_pos]`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `position_map` will include the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1` (since `i` increases by 1).

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are `i` and `n` (though `n` does not change, it is mentioned for completeness):

State: **`target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`. Additionally, `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`**.
