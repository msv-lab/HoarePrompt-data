`current_x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`. Additionally, `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`, and `current_x` is increased by 1.
