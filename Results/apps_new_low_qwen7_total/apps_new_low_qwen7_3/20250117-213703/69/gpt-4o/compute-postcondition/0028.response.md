The code `final_y -= 1` decreases the value of `final_y` by 1. Since the initial state of `final_y` depends on the value of `op`, we need to consider the different cases for `op`. However, regardless of the value of `op`, the initial state specifies that `final_y` is initially set according to `op`. After the code executes, `final_y` will be decreased by 1.

- If `op == 'U'`, `final_y` is initially increased by 1, so after the code, `final_y` will be `initial_final_y + 1 - 1 = initial_final_y`.
- If `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is initially decreased by 1, so after the code, `final_y` will be `initial_final_y - 1 - 1 = initial_final_y - 2`.
- If `op == 'L'` or `op == 'R'`, `final_y` remains unchanged, so after the code, `final_y` will still be `initial_final_y`.

Since the exact value of `op` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `initial_final_y`, but we know the change it undergoes.

For `final_x`, since there is no operation that directly affects `final_x`, its value remains unchanged from its initial state based on `op`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`final_y` is decreased by 1 from its initial value depending on `op`; `final_x` remains unchanged from its initial value based on `op`.**
