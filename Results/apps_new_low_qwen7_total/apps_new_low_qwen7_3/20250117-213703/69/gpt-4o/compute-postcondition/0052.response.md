`current_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` was 0, so now `current_x` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the initial value of x, `y` is the initial value of y, `dx` is x - final_x, `dy` is y - final_y, `current_x` is 1, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `min_length` is infinity, `n` is greater than 0, `operations[i]` is 'R'.
