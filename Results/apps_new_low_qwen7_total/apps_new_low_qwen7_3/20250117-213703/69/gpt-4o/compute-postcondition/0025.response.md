Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), and depending on the value of `op`, the following changes occur: 
- If `op == 'U'`, `final_y` is increased by 1.
- If `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is decreased by 1.
- If `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is decreased by 1.
- If `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, both `final_y` and `final_x` remain unchanged.***
