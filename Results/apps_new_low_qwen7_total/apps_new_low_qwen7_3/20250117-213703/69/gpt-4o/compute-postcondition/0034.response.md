Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string, two characters shorter. Depending on the value of `op`, the following changes occur: if `op == 'U'`, `final_y` is increased by 1 and `final_x` remains unchanged. If `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is decreased by 1 and `final_x` remains unchanged. If `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is decreased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is increased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
