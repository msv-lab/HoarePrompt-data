`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `op` remains 'L' since the code only affects `final_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'L', and `final_x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1**
