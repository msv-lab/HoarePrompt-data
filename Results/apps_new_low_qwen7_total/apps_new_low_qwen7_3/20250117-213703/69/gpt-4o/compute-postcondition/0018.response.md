The code `final_y += 1` increments the value of `final_y` by 1. The value of `operations` and the conditions for updating `final_x` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, `final_y` is updated, while the other variables maintain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is increased by 1, `final_x` is decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'L', set to its initial value plus 1 if the next `op` is 'R', and remains unchanged otherwise**
