The code `final_x -= 1` decrements the value of `final_x` by 1. According to the initial state, `final_x` is set to its initial value minus 1 if the next operation (`op`) is 'L', and remains unchanged otherwise. Since the code simply subtracts 1 from `final_x` without checking the value of `op`, the only change is a direct decrement of 1 from `final_x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise, `final_x` is its initial value minus 1, `final_x` is decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'L', set to its initial value plus 1 if the next `op` is 'R', and remains unchanged otherwise**
