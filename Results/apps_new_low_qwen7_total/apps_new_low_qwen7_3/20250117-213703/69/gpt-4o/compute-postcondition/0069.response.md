Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`, and `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'D', `current_y` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x + 1, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`. The overall state of the program retains the conditions stated in the precondition.***
