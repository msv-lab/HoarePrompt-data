The code `final_x += 1` increments the value of `final_x` by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `final_x` is its original value plus 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise, `final_x` is its initial value plus 1, `final_x` is decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'L', set to its initial value plus 1 if the next `op` is 'R', and remains unchanged otherwise**
