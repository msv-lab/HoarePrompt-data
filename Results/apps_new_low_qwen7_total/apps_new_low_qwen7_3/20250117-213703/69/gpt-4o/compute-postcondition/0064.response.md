`current_y` is decremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `target_pos` is still in `position_map`
- `min_length` is still updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`
- `n` is still greater than 0
- `position_map` contains the key `(0, 0)` with the value `-1`, and now also includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`

Output State: **`target_pos` is in `position_map`; `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains the key `(0, 0)` with the value `-1`, and now also includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`; `current_y` is decreased by 1**
