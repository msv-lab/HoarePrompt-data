Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is `current_x + dx`, `current_y + 1` if `operations[i]` is 'U', or `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy` otherwise. `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. `n` is greater than 0. `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (`current_x`, `current_y`) with the value `i + 1`. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated accordingly.***
