The provided code snippet does not contain any operations that modify the values of `x` or `y`, nor does it change the values of `dx` or `dy`. It simply calculates the values of `dx` and `dy` based on the initial conditions provided in the precondition. Given the precondition, `dx` is calculated as `x - final_x` and `dy` is calculated as `y - final_y`.

Since the values of `x` and `y` are not modified by this code block, and the code itself does not provide new values for these variables, the calculation of `dx` and `dy` relies solely on the initial values of `x` and `y` (which are not provided) and the values of `final_x` and `final_y`.

Let's summarize the impact:
- `dx = x - final_x`: This line subtracts `final_x` from the current value of `x`.
- `dy = y - final_y`: This line subtracts `final_y` from the current value of `y`.

Given that the initial state is that `operations` is an empty string, `final_x` is equal to the initial value of `x` minus the number of 'L' operations plus the number of 'R' operations, and `final_y` is equal to the initial value of `y` plus the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, and considering the code does not change `x` or `y`, we can directly calculate `dx` and `dy` using the initial conditions.

However, without specific initial values for `x` and `y`, we can't compute the exact numerical values for `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the output state will still include the unchanged variables `x` and `y` and the computed values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **x is the initial value of x, y is the initial value of y, dx is x - final_x, dy is y - final_y**
