Postcondition: **`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is adjusted based on the next operation (`op`) as follows: if `op == 'U'`, `final_y` is increased by 1; if `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `final_y` remains unchanged. `final_x` is adjusted based on the value of `op`: if `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is decreased by 1; if `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is increased by 1; otherwise, `final_x` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is further decreased by 1.**
