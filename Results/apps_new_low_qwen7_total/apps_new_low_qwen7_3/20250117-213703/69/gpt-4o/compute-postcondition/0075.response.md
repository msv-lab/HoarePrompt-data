Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`. This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `target_pos` is `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`
   - `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `position_map` contains at least the keys `(0, 0)` with value `-1`, and `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`, so `n` must remain unchanged or decrease if it was exactly `i + 1` in the previous iteration.

5. **Determine the New States**:
   - `target_pos` remains the same since it is based on `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy`, which do not change within the loop.
   - `min_length` may or may not change depending on the loop body, but the problem specifies we only need to adjust the initial conditions.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `position_map` does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the next iteration should be:

State: **`target_pos` is current_x + dx, current_y + dy; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and i - position_map[target_pos]; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y) with the value i + 1**
