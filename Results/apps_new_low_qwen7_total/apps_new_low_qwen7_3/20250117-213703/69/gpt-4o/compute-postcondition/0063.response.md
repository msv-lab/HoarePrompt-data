The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. The other variables (`target_pos`, `min_length`, `n`, `position_map`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `n` is greater than 0, `position_map` contains at least the key `(0, 0)` with value `-1`, and the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i + 1`; `current_y` is increased by 1.**
