Output State: **x is the initial value of x, y is the initial value of y, dx is x - final_x, dy is y - final_y, current_x is 0, current_y is 0, position_map is {(0, 0): -1}, min_length is infinity**

Explanation:
- The first line sets `min_length` to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- The second line initializes `current_x` to 0.
- The third line initializes `current_y` to 0.
- The fourth line creates a dictionary `position_map` with a single key-value pair `(0, 0): -1`.

All these assignments do not affect the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` which remain as specified in the initial state. The condition `(dx != 0 or dy != 0)` remains true as no changes were made to `dx` or `dy` that would make them zero.
