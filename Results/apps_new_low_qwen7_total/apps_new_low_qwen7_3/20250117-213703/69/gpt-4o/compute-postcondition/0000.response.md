The provided code block initializes two variables, `final_x` and `final_y`, both set to 0. However, the code block itself does not perform any operations that would modify these variables or any other variables based on the given initial state. It only sets the initial values of `final_x` and `final_y`.

Given this, the variables `operations`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the values of `final_x` and `final_y` remain at their initialized values of 0.

Output State: **operations is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, x, y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, final_x is 0, final_y is 0**
