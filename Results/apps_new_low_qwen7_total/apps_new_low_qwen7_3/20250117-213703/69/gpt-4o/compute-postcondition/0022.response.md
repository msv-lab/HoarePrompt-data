Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `final_y` is increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise, `final_x` is its initial value plus 1 if the condition `op == 'R'` is true, and remains unchanged otherwise.***
