Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string, `final_y` is increased by 1 if `op` is 'U'. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is its initial value plus 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', there is no change in `final_x` and `final_y`.***
