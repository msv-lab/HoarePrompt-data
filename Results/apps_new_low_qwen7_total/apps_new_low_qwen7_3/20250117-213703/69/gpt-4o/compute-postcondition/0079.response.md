`current_x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`target_pos` is current_x + dx, current_y + dy; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and i - position_map[target_pos]; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y) with the value i + 1; `current_x` is current_x + 1**
