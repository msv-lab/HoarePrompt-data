The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`target_pos` is current_x + dx, current_y + dy; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and i - position_map[target_pos]; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y) with the value i + 1; `current_x` is decreased by 1**
