`current_y` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `target_pos` is still `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`
- `min_length` remains the same as the minimum of `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y + 1) with the value `i + 1` (since `current_y` was originally `current_y + 1`)

Output State: **`target_pos` is current_x + dx, current_y + dy; `min_length` is the minimum of `min_length` and i - position_map[target_pos]; `n` is greater than 0; `position_map` contains at least the keys (0, 0) with value -1, and (current_x, current_y) with the value i; `current_y` is decreased by 1.**
