Postcondition: ***`operations` is a non-empty string (one character shorter). `final_y` is increased by 1 if the next `op` is 'U', decreased by 1 if the next `op` is 'D', and remains unchanged otherwise. `final_x` is adjusted based on the value of `op`: if `op == 'L'`, `final_x` is decreased by 1; if `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is increased by 1; otherwise, `final_x` remains unchanged.***
