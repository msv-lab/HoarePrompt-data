Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the final position of the robot after executing all operations.
2. It then determines the necessary adjustments required to reach the target position `(x, y)` by computing the differences `dx` and `dy`.
3. If `dx` and `dy` are both zero, the function correctly returns 0, indicating no changes are needed.
4. For cases where `dx` and `dy` are non-zero, the function uses a dictionary `position_map` to keep track of the indices of positions visited during the first pass through the operations.
5. During the second pass, the function calculates the target position for each operation and checks if it matches any previously visited position. If it does, it updates the minimum length required to change the subsequence to reach the target position.
6. The function handles the case where it cannot reach the target position by returning -1 if no valid subsequence is found.

Based on the above analysis, the function appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
