You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.

- Program:
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, and `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.

The function first computes the final position (`final_x`, `final_y`) based on the given operations. It then calculates the difference between the initial position (`x`, `y`) and the final position (`dx`, `dy`). If the differences are zero, it immediately returns 0.

If the differences are non-zero, the function performs a second pass through the operations to find the minimum length of a path that revisits a previously visited position. This is done using a dictionary `position_map` to keep track of the indices where each position was last seen. The function calculates the target position for each operation and checks if it has been visited before. If it has, the function updates the `min_length` if the current path length is shorter than the previous recorded minimum length.

After completing the second pass, the function returns the minimum length found if it is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem correctly. Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initial Position Calculation**:
   - The initial positions `final_x` and `final_y` are calculated based on the given operations.
   - The difference between the desired end position `(x, y)` and the initial position is computed (`dx`, `dy`).

2. **Checking Immediate Validity**:
   - If the robot is already at the target position `(x, y)`, the function immediately returns `0`.

3. **Tracking Positions and Lengths**:
   - A dictionary `position_map` is used to track the positions of the robot as it progresses through the operations.
   - For each operation, the current position of the robot is updated.
   - The target position `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` is computed, representing where the robot would be if it had reached the target `(x, y)` by the current operation.
   - If this target position was previously seen, the length of the subsequence that needs changing is calculated and updated if it is shorter than the current minimum length.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After iterating through all operations, if no valid subsequence was found, `-1` is returned, indicating it's impossible to reach the target.

Given these steps, the program correctly calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to make the robot end at `(x, y)`. It handles both the immediate case and the general case where the operations need modification.
