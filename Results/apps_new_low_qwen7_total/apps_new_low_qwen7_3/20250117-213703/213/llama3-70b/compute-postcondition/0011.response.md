The code joins the elements of `digits` from the start up to index `i-1` and from index `i+1` to the end, excluding the element at index `1`. It then converts this joined string into an integer to assign to `new_n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `digits` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1.

Since `i` is 2, the code will exclude the element at index 1 and concatenate the remaining elements of `digits`. The new value of `new_n` will be the integer formed by the concatenation of these elements.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1.**
