The code snippet prints "NO" regardless of the values of `n`, `digits`, and `i`. Since the loop does not change any of these variables and the condition inside the loop is not checked because of the print statement, the values of `n`, `digits`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of `digits`, and the output is "NO"**
