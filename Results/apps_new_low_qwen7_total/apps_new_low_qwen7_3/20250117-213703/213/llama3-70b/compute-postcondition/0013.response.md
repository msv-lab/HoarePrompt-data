Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the function prints "YES" and `new_n`. Otherwise, the function continues without any specific change to the variables' states.***
