The code removes the `i`-th element from the `digits` list, converts the remaining elements into a string, joins them, and then converts the resulting string back into an integer to assign to `new_n`. The value of `i` is 0, which means the first element of the `digits` list is removed.

Let's assume the initial state of `digits` is `[1, 2, 3]` for illustration purposes (since `digits` is a list with at least one element).

1. `new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))`
   - `digits[:i]` is `digits[:0]`, which is an empty list.
   - `digits[i + 1:]` is `digits[1:]`, which is `[2, 3]`.
   - `''.join(map(str, [] + [2, 3]))` results in `'23'`.
   - `int('23')` results in `23`.

So, `new_n` is now `23`. The values of `n` and `digits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0; `new_n` is 23**.
