Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digits` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `new_n` is 24.

2. **Condition for `new_n`:**
   - The original `new_n` is 23.
   - If `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'`, then `new_n` remains 24.
   - Since 23 % 8 â‰  0, the condition is not met, so `new_n` does not change from its original value of 23.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop head: `for i in range(len(digits))`.

4. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n`, `digits`, and `new_n` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `n` is still a non-negative integer.
   - `digits` is still a list of integers.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `new_n` is still 23 (unchanged).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `new_n` is 23.**
