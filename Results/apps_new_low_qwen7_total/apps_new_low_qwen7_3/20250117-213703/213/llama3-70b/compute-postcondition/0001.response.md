Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(digits))`.
   - This means `i` is the loop variable and `digits` is the iterable over which `i` iterates.
   - The initial value of `i` is set to 0, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(digits)`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(digits)`.
   - When the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.
   - The length of `digits` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **State the Required Conditions:**
   - `n` (a non-negative integer) is already converted to an integer type and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of `n`, and it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `i` must be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

Based on this analysis, the state required for the loop to execute the first time is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0**
