Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', this condition is met. Otherwise, no specific changes or conditions are imposed on the variables.***
