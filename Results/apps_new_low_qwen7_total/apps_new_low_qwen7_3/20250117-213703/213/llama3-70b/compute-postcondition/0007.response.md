The code concatenates the elements of the list `digits` except for the element at index `i`. It then converts the resulting string back into an integer and assigns it to `new_n`.

- The initial value of `new_n` is 23.
- `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of `digits` will be excluded from the concatenation.
- The new value of `new_n` will be the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1.

Let's assume `digits` is a list of integers. Since the exact list is not given, we will denote the elements of `digits` as `d0`, `d1`, `d2`, etc., and exclude `d1` (the element at index 1).

If `digits` is `[d0, d1, d2, ...]`, then after the code runs, `new_n` will be the integer formed by `d0`, `d2`, `d3`, ..., i.e., `int(d0 + d2 + d3 + ...)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1.**
