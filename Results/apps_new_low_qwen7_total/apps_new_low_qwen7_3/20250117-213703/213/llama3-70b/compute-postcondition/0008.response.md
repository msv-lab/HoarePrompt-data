Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, digits is a list of integers, i is 1, new_n is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of digits except for the element at index 1**

Explanation:
- The first line prints 'YES'.
- The second line prints the value of `new_n`, which is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1.
- The third line exits the program, so no further changes occur.
Since the code does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, or `digits`, these variables retain their initial states. The value of `new_n` is printed but not updated by the code block. Therefore, the final state includes all the variables from the initial state without any changes.
