Functionality: **The function takes a non-negative integer \( n \) represented as a string and checks if it's possible to remove exactly one digit from \( n \) to make the resulting number divisible by 8. If such a removal can achieve this, the function prints "YES" followed by the resulting number; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function iterates through each digit of \( n \), temporarily removing each digit and checking if the remaining number is divisible by 8 and does not have a leading zero. If no valid removal is found, the function concludes by printing "NO".**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where the input string \( n \) is empty or contains only a single digit. In these cases, since it's not possible to remove any digit, the function will print "NO".
- The function also correctly handles leading zeros in the initial string representation of \( n \). However, if the initial number \( n \) itself is divisible by 8, the function does not account for this scenario. It should check if \( n \) is already divisible by 8 before starting the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

**Summary of Final State:**
- The function concludes by either printing "YES" followed by the number obtained by removing one digit to make it divisible by 8, or it prints "NO" if no such removal is possible. The input \( n \) remains unchanged, and the internal variables `digits`, `i`, and `new_n` are set to their final values after the loop completes.
