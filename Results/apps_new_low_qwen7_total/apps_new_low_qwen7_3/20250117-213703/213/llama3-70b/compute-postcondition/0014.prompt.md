Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first few iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: Think step by step about what the commands in the loop do and how they interact with the initial state.
2. **Track Variable Changes**: Identify variables that are updated during the loop and those that remain constant or depend on the initial state. Clearly note which variables are **invariant** (do not change across iterations).
3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**: Describe how the loop's execution affects the values and relationships of variables after all iterations, considering edge cases like when the loop does not execute.
4. **Verify Relationships**: Confirm that the relationships and invariants identified from the loop code are consistent with the described iterations and final output state.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer converted to an integer type, digits is a list of integers where each element is a digit of n
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
    if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
        print('YES')
        print(new_n)
        exit()


The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `new_n` is 24. If the original `new_n` (which is 23) meets the condition `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'`, then `new_n` remains 24. Otherwise, `new_n` does not change from its original value of 23.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', this condition is met. Otherwise, no specific changes or conditions are imposed on the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', the function prints "YES" and `new_n`. Otherwise, the function continues without any specific change to the variables' states.


Make sure to include:  
- Any variables that remain constant throughout the loop.  
- Final values of all variables after the loop finishes.  
- Conditions under which the loop executes or does not execute.  

Use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
