Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(digits)):`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `len(digits)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digits` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', this condition is met. Otherwise, no specific changes or conditions are imposed on the variables.

3. **Understand how the loop affects the state**:
   - The loop increments `i` starting from 1.
   - For each iteration, `i` will take values from 1 up to `len(digits) - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The length of the `digits` list remains unchanged during the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `digits` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer, `digits` remains a list of integers, and `new_n` remains unchanged unless a specific condition is met (which is not relevant for determining the next state).

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, and `new_n` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index 1. If `new_n` is divisible by 8 and does not start with '0', this condition is met. Otherwise, no specific changes or conditions are imposed on the variables.**
