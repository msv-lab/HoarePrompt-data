Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `new_n` is 24. If the original `new_n` (which is 23) meets the condition `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'`, then `new_n` remains 24. Otherwise, `new_n` does not change from its original value of 23.***
