Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digits` is a list of integers, and `i` is the length of `digits`. The variable `new_n` will be set to the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` except for the element at index `i` if the condition `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'` is met. If this condition is met for any iteration, the loop will print "YES" and `new_n` and then exit. If the condition is never met for any iteration, the loop will continue to the end without printing anything. After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `digits`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i`: Will be equal to the length of `digits` after the loop completes.
- `new_n`: Will be the last value of `new_n` that met the condition `new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0'`, or it will remain the original value of `new_n` if no such value was found.

If no value of `new_n` meets the condition during the loop's execution, `new_n` will retain its original value (initially formed from `digits`).
