Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, digits is a list of integers, i is 0, new_n is 24**

Explanation:
- The first line `print('YES')` prints "YES" to the console but does not affect any variables.
- The second line `print(new_n)` prints the value of `new_n` to the console, which is 24 (since it was previously divisible by 8 and had no leading zero). Again, this does not change any variable values.
- The third line `exit()` terminates the program, but since we are focusing on the final state after executing all lines, we note that `new_n` is now 24. The precondition states that `new_n` was initially 23 and became divisible by 8, so the only logical change is that `new_n` is now 24 (the next number divisible by 8 after 23 without a leading zero). All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
