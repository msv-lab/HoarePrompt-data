Reasoning:
1. The annotated program checks if it's possible to remove some digits from the given number such that the resulting number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeroes.
2. It iterates through each digit in the number and generates a new number by removing each digit individually.
3. For each new number generated, it checks if the number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeroes.
4. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number and exits.
5. If no such number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The logic described in the annotated program matches the problem statement. The program correctly checks all possible cases by iterating through each digit and generating the required numbers. It also handles the edge case where no valid number can be formed by printing "NO" at the end.

Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
