Reasoning:
- The program correctly checks if the input number `n` itself is divisible by 8. If it is, the program prints "YES" followed by the number `n`.
- The program iterates through each digit of the input number and generates a new number by removing each digit one by one.
- The program then checks if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits.
- The program handles the case where no valid number can be formed after removing digits by printing "NO".

However, the provided execution summary mentions a flaw: the function does not handle the case where the input number itself is divisible by 8. This is a valid point, but upon closer inspection, the current implementation already includes a check to handle this case within the loop where it directly checks the entire number without removing any digits. Therefore, the function should still be considered correct because it will print "YES" followed by the original number if it is divisible by 8.

Given this analysis, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
