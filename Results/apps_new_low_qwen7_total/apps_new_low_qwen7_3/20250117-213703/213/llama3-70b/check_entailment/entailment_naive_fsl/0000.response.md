Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the original number is already divisible by 8. For example, if the input is `8`, the program will not output anything because it only checks by removing one digit at a time. Here is a specific case that the program fails:

- Input: `8`
- Expected Output: `YES\n8`
- Actual Output: The program will print `NO` because it only tries removing one digit at a time and does not check if the original number itself is divisible by 8.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover the case where the entire number can be used directly if it is divisible by 8.
