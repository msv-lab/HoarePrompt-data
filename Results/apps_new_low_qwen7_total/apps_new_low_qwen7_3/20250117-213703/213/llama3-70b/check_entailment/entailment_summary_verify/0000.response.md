### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The summary mentions that the function does not handle the case where the original number is already divisible by 8. This means that if the input number itself is divisible by 8, the program should directly output "YES" followed by the number itself without attempting to remove any digits.
- The summary also notes that the function handles cases with leading zeros correctly but does not account for the scenario where the original number is divisible by 8.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates through each digit of the input number `n` and constructs a new number by removing each digit one at a time.
- If the new number formed is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros, it prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits.
- If no such number is found after trying all possible removals, it prints "NO".

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where the original number is already divisible by 8. Let's verify this:
  - If the input number `n` is `8`, the program should output "YES\n8". However, the current implementation does not check if `n` itself is divisible by 8 before entering the loop.
  - To fix this, we need to add a condition at the beginning of the function to check if `n` is divisible by 8. If it is, we should print "YES" followed by `n` and exit.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n % 8 == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(n)
        exit()
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles the case where the original number is divisible by 8. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
