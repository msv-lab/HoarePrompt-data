You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a non-negative integer n, its decimal representation consists of at most 100 digits and doesn't contain leading zeroes.

Your task is to determine if it is possible in this case to remove some of the digits (possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains at least one digit, forms a non-negative integer, doesn't have leading zeroes and is divisible by 8. After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.

If a solution exists, you should print it.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains a non-negative integer n. The representation of number n doesn't contain any leading zeroes and its length doesn't exceed 100 digits. 


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number n. 

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number n in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by 8.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3454

Output
YES
344

Input
10

Output
YES
0

Input
111111

Output
NO

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            exit()
    print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
- The function handles the case where the input string \( n \) is empty or contains only a single digit. In these cases, since it's not possible to remove any digit, the function will print "NO".
- The function also correctly handles leading zeros in the initial string representation of \( n \). However, if the initial number \( n \) itself is divisible by 8, the function does not account for this scenario. It should check if \( n \) is already divisible by 8 before starting the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number `n` and generating a new number by removing each digit individually. It then checks if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits the program. If no such number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

However, the program has a flaw in how it handles the removal of digits. Specifically, the program only removes one digit at a time, but the problem allows for the removal of any combination of digits. This means the current implementation will not consider all possible ways to remove digits to form a valid number.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks the removal of one digit at a time, whereas the problem statement allows for the removal of any combination of digits. Therefore, the program might miss valid solutions where more than one digit is removed.
