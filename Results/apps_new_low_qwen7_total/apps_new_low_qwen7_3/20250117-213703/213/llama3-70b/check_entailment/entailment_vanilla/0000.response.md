### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number `n` and generating a new number by removing each digit individually. It then checks if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros. If such a number is found, it prints "YES" followed by the new number and exits the program. If no such number is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

However, the program has a flaw in how it handles the removal of digits. Specifically, the program only removes one digit at a time, but the problem allows for the removal of any combination of digits. This means the current implementation will not consider all possible ways to remove digits to form a valid number.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks the removal of one digit at a time, whereas the problem statement allows for the removal of any combination of digits. Therefore, the program might miss valid solutions where more than one digit is removed.
