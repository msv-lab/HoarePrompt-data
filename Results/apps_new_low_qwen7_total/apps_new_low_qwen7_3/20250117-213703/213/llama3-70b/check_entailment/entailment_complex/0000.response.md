Reasoning:

The annotated program provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure correctness:

1. **Initial Check for Divisibility by 8**: The program currently does not check if the entire number `n` is divisible by 8 before proceeding with the removal process. This is necessary because if `n` itself is divisible by 8, no digits need to be removed, and we can directly output "YES" followed by `n`.

2. **Handling Single-Digit Numbers**: The program should handle the case where `n` is a single-digit number properly. If `n` is a single digit and divisible by 8, the program should still output "YES" and `n`. Otherwise, it should output "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**: The program should ensure that it handles edge cases like very large numbers efficiently.

Given these points, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    
    # Check if n is already divisible by 8
    if n % 8 == 0:
        print("YES")
        print(n)
        return
    
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        new_n = int(''.join(map(str, digits[:i] + digits[i + 1:])))
        
        if new_n % 8 == 0 and str(new_n)[0] != '0':
            print('YES')
            print(new_n)
            return
        
    print('NO')
```

**Analysis**:
- The program now checks if the entire number `n` is divisible by 8 before proceeding with the digit removal process.
- It correctly handles the case where `n` is a single-digit number and is divisible by 8.
- The loop correctly iterates over each digit and attempts to form a new number by removing the current digit and checking if the new number is divisible by 8 and does not have leading zeros.
- If no valid number is found, it prints "NO".

Based on this analysis, the program is now correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
