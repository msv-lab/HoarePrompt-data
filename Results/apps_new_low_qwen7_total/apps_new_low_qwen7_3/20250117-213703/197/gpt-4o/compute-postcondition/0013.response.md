Output State: **base is base squared modulo mod, exponent is exponent divided by 2, result is updated such that if exponent % 2 == 1, then result is result_initial * base % mod**

Explanation:
1. The first line `base = base * base % mod` updates the value of `base` to be its square modulo `mod`.
2. The second line `exponent //= 2` updates the value of `exponent` to be its integer division by 2.

The variable `result` is mentioned in the precondition but is not directly modified by the code. It is only updated under a specific condition if `exponent % 2 == 1`, which is not executed here since the exact value of `exponent` is not provided. Therefore, the final state includes the unchanged `result` from the precondition.
