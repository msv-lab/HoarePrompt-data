The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `k`. `x` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of dresses, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of months in a year minus one (with `k + 1` being the total number of months in the year). The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns the value of `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) mod (10^9 + 7)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `x` and `k`, where `x` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of months in a year minus one. The function returns 0 in one case and returns `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) mod (10^9 + 7)` in another case.
