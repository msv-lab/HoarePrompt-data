Given the initial state:
- `base` is `base squared modulo mod`
- `exponent` is the original exponent divided by 2 (as an integer) and `exponent` must be greater than 0
- `result` is `(r * base) % mod` if `exponent % 2 == 1`. Since there is no else part, this is the only case considered.

The code block to execute is:
```
base = base * base % mod
exponent //= 2
```

Let's analyze the effects of these lines:

1. The first line updates `base` to be the square of its current value modulo `mod`.
2. The second line halves the value of `exponent` (using integer division).

Since the initial state specifies that `base` is already `base squared modulo mod`, the first line effectively keeps `base` the same because it's already the result of squaring itself modulo `mod`. 

The second line updates `exponent` by halving its value.

So, the final state is:
- `base` remains unchanged
- `exponent` is halved (integer division)

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **base is base squared modulo mod, exponent is exponent // 2**
