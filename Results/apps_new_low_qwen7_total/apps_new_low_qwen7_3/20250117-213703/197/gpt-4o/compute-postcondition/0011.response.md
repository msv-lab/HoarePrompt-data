The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `base` and then taking modulo `mod`. However, the initial value of `result` is not specified in the initial state. Let's denote the initial value of `result` as `result_initial`.

- The value of `base` remains unchanged and is equal to `base` squared modulo `mod`.
- The value of `exponent` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- The value of `result` is updated to `result_initial * base % mod`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `base` is `base` squared modulo `mod`, `exponent` is greater than 0, `result` is `result_initial * base % mod`.

Output State: **`base` is `base` squared modulo `mod`, `exponent` is greater than 0, `result` is `result_initial * base % mod`**
