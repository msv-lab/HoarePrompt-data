Output State: **x is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, power is \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), result is \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), MOD is 1000000007**

Explanation:
- The first line calculates `power` as \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\). This is done using the function `func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)`.
- The second line calculates `result` as \(x \cdot (power - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), where `power` is the value calculated in the first line.
- All other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `x` and `k` are preserved, and `MOD` remains as \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the exact values of `x` and `k` are not provided, they are left in their general form, and the specific operations on `power` and `result` are described based on the given expressions.
