Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `exponent > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `base` is `base` squared modulo `mod`, and `exponent` is `exponent // 2`.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `exponent` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `base` is `base` squared modulo `mod`.
- `exponent` is `exponent // 2`.

We need to ensure that `exponent` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `exponent`. It must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`base` is `base` squared modulo `mod`, `exponent` must be greater than 0**
