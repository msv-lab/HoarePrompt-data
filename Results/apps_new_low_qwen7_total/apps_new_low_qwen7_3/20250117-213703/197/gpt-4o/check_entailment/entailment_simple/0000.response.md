Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the expected number of dresses after one year, considering the doubling effect and the random loss of one dress with 50% probability each month, except the last month.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The number of dresses doubles each month.
   - With 50% probability, one dress is eaten at the end of each month, except the last one.
   - We need to calculate the expected number of dresses modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analyzed Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates \(base^{exponent} \mod mod\). However, in the annotated code, it is not used correctly. The function should be used to compute the power of 2, which is necessary for the calculation.
   - **func_2**: This function computes the expected number of dresses. It uses the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which accounts for the doubling effect and the expected loss of dresses.

4. **Issues in the Given Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly utilized. Instead of computing \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), it is not called or its result is not used.
   - The function `func_2` directly uses the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), but it does not correctly account for the 50% chance of losing a dress each month, except the last month.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly simulate the process, we need to account for the doubling and the random loss of one dress with 50% probability each month, except the last month.
   - The expected number of dresses after \(k\) months can be calculated recursively considering both the doubled and reduced scenarios with their respective probabilities.

Given the analysis, the current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly account for the random loss of dresses each month. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
