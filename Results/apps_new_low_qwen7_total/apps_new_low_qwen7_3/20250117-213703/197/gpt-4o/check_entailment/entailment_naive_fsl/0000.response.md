Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the wardrobe eats one of the dresses with 50% probability after each doubling, except for the last month of the year.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements modular exponentiation, which is not directly related to the main problem logic but seems to be included for some other purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to calculate the expected number of dresses after one year. However, it does not properly simulate the wardrobe eating dresses with 50% probability after each doubling except the last month.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Initial Calculation**: The function calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is the number of dresses before the wardrobe starts eating them.
- **Eating Dresses**: The function does not correctly simulate the wardrobe eating dresses with 50% probability after each doubling except the last month.

To fix this, we need to simulate the process of doubling the dresses and then randomly deciding whether to eat one dress with 50% probability for each doubling except the last one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import random
from typing import List

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def expected_dresses(x: int, k: int) -> int:
    total_dresses = x
    for _ in range(k):
        total_dresses *= 2
        if random.random() < 0.5 and total_dresses > 1:
            total_dresses -= 1
    return total_dresses % MOD

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(expected_dresses(x, k))
```

This corrected version uses a simulation approach to accurately model the behavior of the wardrobe. However, since the original problem requires a mathematical solution rather than a simulation, the correct mathematical approach would involve calculating the expected value based on probabilities, which is more complex but can be done using dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation.

Given the constraints and the need for a deterministic solution, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic and thus is **Incorrect**.
