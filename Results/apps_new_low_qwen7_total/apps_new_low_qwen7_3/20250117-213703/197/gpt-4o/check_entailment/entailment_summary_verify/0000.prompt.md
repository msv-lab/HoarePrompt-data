You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)
    result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, with `k + 1` being the total number of months in the year). It uses another function `func_1` to compute `2^(k+1)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. If `x` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` and returns this value. The function ensures that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the wardrobe eats one of the dresses with 50% probability after each doubling, except for the last month of the year.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements modular exponentiation, which is not directly related to the main problem logic but seems to be included for some other purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to calculate the expected number of dresses after one year. However, it does not properly simulate the wardrobe eating dresses with 50% probability after each doubling except the last month.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Initial Calculation**: The function calculates \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is the number of dresses before the wardrobe starts eating them.
- **Eating Dresses**: The function does not correctly simulate the wardrobe eating dresses with 50% probability after each doubling except the last month.

To fix this, we need to simulate the process of doubling the dresses and then randomly deciding whether to eat one dress with 50% probability for each doubling except the last one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import random
from typing import List

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def expected_dresses(x: int, k: int) -> int:
    total_dresses = x
    for _ in range(k):
        total_dresses *= 2
        if random.random() < 0.5 and total_dresses > 1:
            total_dresses -= 1
    return total_dresses % MOD

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(expected_dresses(x, k))
```

This corrected version uses a simulation approach to accurately model the behavior of the wardrobe. However, since the original problem requires a mathematical solution rather than a simulation, the correct mathematical approach would involve calculating the expected value based on probabilities, which is more complex but can be done using dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation.

Given the constraints and the need for a deterministic solution, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic and thus is **Incorrect**.
