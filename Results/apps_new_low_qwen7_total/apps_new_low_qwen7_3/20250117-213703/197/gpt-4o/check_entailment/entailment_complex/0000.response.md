Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year after starting with `x` dresses. The number of dresses doubles each month and with 50% probability, one dress is eaten.
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the modular exponentiation to calculate \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- Function `func_2` computes the expected number of dresses using the formula \(x \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), considering the doubling effect and the probability of losing one dress per month.
- Given that the provided functions cover all necessary steps to solve the problem accurately, and the logic aligns with the problem statement, the overall implementation seems correct.

Correctness: **True**
