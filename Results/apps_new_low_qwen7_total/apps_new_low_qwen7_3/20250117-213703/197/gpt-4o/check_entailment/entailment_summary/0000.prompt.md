 Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).

Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the 50% probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. 

Nastya owns x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for k + 1 months.

Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.


-----Output-----

In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 0

Output
4

Input
2 1

Output
7

Input
3 2

Output
21



-----Note-----

In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all.

In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = sys.stdin.read
(x, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_2(x, k))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base % mod
        base = base * base % mod
        exponent //= 2
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. `base` is a non-negative integer, `exponent` is a non-negative integer, and `mod` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7). The function calculates `base` raised to the power of the sum of the odd parts of the original `exponent` modulo `mod`. This is achieved through a loop where the `exponent` is repeatedly halved, and the `base` is squared, reducing the problem size efficiently. If the current `exponent` is odd, the `base` is multiplied by the current `result` and then taken modulo `mod`. The loop continues until the `exponent` becomes zero. The function returns the final `result` which is `base` raised to the power of the sum of the odd parts of the original `exponent` modulo `mod`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, k):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    power = func_1(2, k + 1, MOD)
    result = x * (power - 1) % MOD % MOD
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, with `k + 1` being the total number of months in the year). It uses another function `func_1` to compute `2^(k+1)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. If `x` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` and returns this value. The function ensures that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.
