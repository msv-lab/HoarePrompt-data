Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the expected number of dresses after one year, considering the doubling and the possible reduction by one dress with a 50% probability each month.
- The solution uses a helper function `func_1` to compute \(2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which represents the number of dresses before the potential reduction.
- The main function `func_2` then calculates the expected number of dresses after the year by using the formula \(x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- This formula accounts for the fact that after the doubling, there's a 50% chance the wardrobe will eat one dress, hence the term \((2^{k+1} - 1)\).
- The logic is sound and follows the problem statement correctly. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the approach seems valid.

Based on the provided information and the functions' behavior:
