### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Modular Exponentiation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements modular exponentiation using the fast exponentiation algorithm. It calculates \( base^{exponent} \mod mod \) efficiently.
   - For our specific problem, it computes \( 2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Number Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` computes the expected number of dresses using the formula \( x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - This formula accounts for the doubling of dresses each month and the 50% chance of losing one dress after each doubling.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The program reads input and passes it to `func_2`.
   - `func_2` handles the special case where \( x = 0 \) by returning 0.
   - Otherwise, it computes the expected number of dresses using the formula derived from the problem statement.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
   - The states and transitions align with the logic described in the original assessment.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples (2 0, 2 1, 3 2) match the expected output, validating the implementation.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures the results stay within the bounds of \( 10^9 + 7 \).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case \( x = 0 \) correctly.
   - Large values of \( x \) and \( k \) are handled via modular arithmetic, ensuring the result remains valid.

### Conclusion:
After a detailed analysis of the program, the annotations, and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to compute the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later.

**Final: True**
