### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and check if the given program correctly computes the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later.

1. **Doubling and Reduction**:
   - The number of dresses doubles each month.
   - After doubling, there is a 50% chance that one dress is eaten (resulting in no reduction) and a 50% chance that one dress is lost (resulting in one less dress).

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of dresses.
   - After one month, the expected number of dresses is \( 2x \times 0.5 + (2x - 1) \times 0.5 = 2x - 0.5 \).
   - Generalizing for \( k \) months, the expected number of dresses is \( x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \).

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` implements modular exponentiation, which is used to compute \( 2^{k+1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - The function `func_2` uses the result from `func_1` to calculate the expected number of dresses:
     - If \( x = 0 \), the result is 0.
     - Otherwise, the expected number of dresses is \( x \times (2^{k+1} - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Analysis:
- The code correctly handles the case when \( x = 0 \).
- The use of modular exponentiation ensures that the result fits within the bounds of \( 10^9 + 7 \).
- The formula used in `func_2` correctly computes the expected number of dresses after \( k \) months.

Given the logical correctness and proper implementation of the mathematical formula, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program is logically sound and correctly implements the required computation.
