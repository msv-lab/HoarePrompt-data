The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer representing the initial number of dresses) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of months in a year minus one, with `k + 1` being the total number of months in the year). It uses another function `func_1` to compute `2^(k+1)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. If `x` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates `x * (2^(k+1) - 1) % (10^9 + 7)` and returns this value. The function ensures that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.
