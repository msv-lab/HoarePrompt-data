The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `mod`. `base` is a non-negative integer, `exponent` is a non-negative integer, and `mod` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7). The function calculates `base` raised to the power of the sum of the odd parts of the original `exponent` modulo `mod`. This is achieved through a loop where the `exponent` is repeatedly halved, and the `base` is squared, reducing the problem size efficiently. If the current `exponent` is odd, the `base` is multiplied by the current `result` and then taken modulo `mod`. The loop continues until the `exponent` becomes zero. The function returns the final `result` which is `base` raised to the power of the sum of the odd parts of the original `exponent` modulo `mod`.
