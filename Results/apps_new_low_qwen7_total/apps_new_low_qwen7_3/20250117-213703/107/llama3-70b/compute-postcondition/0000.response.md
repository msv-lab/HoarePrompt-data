Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; a_floor is an integer; a_block is an integer; b_floor is an integer; b_block is an integer; min_block_time is an integer**

Explanation:
- The first two lines take input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and assign them to the respective variables.
- The next two lines take input values for `a` and `b`, and assign them to the respective variables.
- The following lines calculate the floor and block positions for both `a` and `b`:
  - `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, which gives the position of `a` within its block.
  - `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which gives the block number of `a`.
  - Similarly, `b_floor` and `b_block` are calculated for `b`.
- The last line calculates `min_block_time` as the minimum of the time taken to move from one block to another (`abs(a_block - b_block) * 15`) or the time to move to the opposite side of the grid (`n - abs(a_block - b_block) * 15`) multiplied by 15 minutes. This represents the shortest time to move from the block containing `a` to the block containing `b`.
