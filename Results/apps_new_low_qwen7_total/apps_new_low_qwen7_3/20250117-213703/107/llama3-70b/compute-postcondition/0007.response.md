The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is not specified directly through parameters but rather through the constraints given for variables that might be used within the function. However, based on the output cases provided, we can infer the following:

Case_1: The function returns an error message indicating that `a` and `b` are not distinct integers. 
Case_2: The function returns an integer value which is either `a` or `b`.

Given the constraints:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\).

Functionality: **The function returns an error message if `a` and `b` are not distinct integers, and returns either `a` or `b` otherwise.**
