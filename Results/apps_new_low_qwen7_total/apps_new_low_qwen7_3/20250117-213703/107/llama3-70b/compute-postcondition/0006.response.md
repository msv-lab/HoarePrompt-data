The code `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` does not change the values of any variables. It only calculates and prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. Since the initial values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are determined by the conditions given, these values remain unchanged after the print statement.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed value being the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block` are integers; `min_block_time` is an integer; `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor` else `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`; the value of `min_block_time + min_floor_time` is printed.**
