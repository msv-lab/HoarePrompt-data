`min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. This calculation uses the values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, both of which are positive integers and `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`, `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`, `a_floor` is an integer, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is an integer, `b_block` is an integer, `min_block_time` is an integer, `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
