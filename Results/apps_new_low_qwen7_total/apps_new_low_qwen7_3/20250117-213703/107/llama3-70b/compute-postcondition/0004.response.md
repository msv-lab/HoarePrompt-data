`min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are used in this calculation, while the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` remain unchanged. Since `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, the expression `(b_floor - a_floor)` will yield a non-negative integer, and multiplying it by 5 and adding 10 will give a specific value for `min_floor_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and n·m·k, `b` is an integer between 1 and n·m·k and a ≠ b, `a_floor` is an integer, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is an integer, `b_block` is an integer, `min_block_time` is an integer, `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
