Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function to see if it correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem statement.

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the dimensions of the building and the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.
2. **Calculating Floor and Block Numbers**:
   - `a_floor` and `b_floor` calculate the floor number for Edward's and Natasha's apartments respectively.
   - `a_block` and `b_block` calculate the block number for Edward's and Natasha's apartments respectively.
3. **Calculating Minimum Block Travel Time**:
   - `min_block_time` calculates the minimum time to travel between blocks using either direct or circular route (if going in the opposite direction is shorter).
4. **Calculating Minimum Floor Travel Time**:
   - `min_floor_time` calculates the minimum time to travel between floors, considering both directions and the lift option.
5. **Output**: The function prints the sum of the minimum block travel time and the minimum floor travel time.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, let's check if the logic in the function matches the requirements:

- The function correctly computes the block and floor numbers.
- The calculation of `min_block_time` considers both direct and circular routes, which is appropriate.
- The calculation of `min_floor_time` includes the lift wait time, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the function appears to be logically sound and should work correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
