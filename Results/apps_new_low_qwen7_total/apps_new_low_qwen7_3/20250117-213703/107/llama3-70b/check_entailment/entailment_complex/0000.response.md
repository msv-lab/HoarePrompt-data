Reasoning:

1. The provided annotated program correctly identifies the floor and block numbers for both individuals (`a` and `b`) based on their apartment numbers.
2. It calculates the minimum block time, which is the time required to move from one block to another using either the lift or walking around the building. This calculation takes into account the circular nature of the building.
3. It also calculates the minimum floor time, which is the time required to move between floors within the same block. Depending on whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` or vice versa, it adds the appropriate time for moving up or down the floor.
4. The program sums these times and prints the result, which gives the minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment.

The program handles all aspects of the problem statement and does not miss any required calculations or conditions. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
