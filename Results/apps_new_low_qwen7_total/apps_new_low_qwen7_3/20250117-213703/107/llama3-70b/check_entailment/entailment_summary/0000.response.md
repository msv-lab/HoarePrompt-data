Reasoning:

1. The program correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both individuals based on their apartment numbers.
2. It computes the minimum block time by considering the shortest path around the circular building.
3. It correctly calculates the minimum floor time based on whether the target floor is above or below the current floor.
4. The program accounts for the circular nature of the building by using `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15` to find the shortest path between blocks.
5. The logic for handling the floor differences is correct with `if a_floor > b_floor` to calculate the time needed to move down the floor using the elevator.
6. The total time is computed as the sum of the block time and floor time and printed correctly.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all necessary calculations without missing any important aspects, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
