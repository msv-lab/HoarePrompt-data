### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( a \), \( b \).
2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The calculations for `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are correct based on the provided formulas. These formulas correctly determine the floor and block numbers for both apartments.
3. **Minimum Block Travel Time Calculation**: The formula for `min_block_time` is correct. It calculates the minimum time needed to travel between the blocks using the lift, considering the shortest path either clockwise or counterclockwise around the building.
4. **Minimum Floor Travel Time Calculation**: The logic for calculating `min_floor_time` is also correct. It determines whether it's faster to go up or down the stairs based on the difference in floor levels.
5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the total minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natashaâ€™s apartment.

Given that all parts of the program follow the logic and constraints described in the problem statement, and there are no logical errors or omissions, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
