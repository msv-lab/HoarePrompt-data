Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, it fails to consider the time required for Edvard to move between floors within the same block and the optimal route around the building. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
200 100
```
In this case, Edvard is at apartment 200, which is in the 4th block, 2nd floor, and Natasha is at apartment 100, which is in the 2nd block, 1st floor. The program calculates the time to move between blocks and floors but does not account for the most efficient way to reach Natasha's apartment, which involves moving directly from the 2nd floor of the 4th block to the 1st floor of the 2nd block.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible routes, including using the elevator to minimize the time spent on stairs and the optimal path around the building. The current implementation does not handle these complexities properly.
