### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

#### 1. Reading Input
The function correctly reads the dimensions of the building (`n`, `m`, `k`) and the apartment numbers of Edward (`a`) and Natasha (`b`).

#### 2. Calculating Floor and Block Numbers
The calculations for `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are correct. These calculations determine the correct floor and block for each apartment number. Specifically:
- `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`
- `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`
- `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`

These formulas correctly map apartment numbers to their respective floors and blocks.

#### 3. Calculating Minimum Block Travel Time
The logic for `min_block_time` is almost correct but needs minor adjustments:
- `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`

This formula calculates the minimum time to travel between blocks, considering both direct and circular routes. However, the circular route part (`n - abs(a_block - b_block)`) can be simplified and made more clear:
- If `abs(a_block - b_block) < n / 2`, the direct route is shorter.
- If `abs(a_block - b_block) >= n / 2`, the circular route is shorter.

This can be written as:
```python
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
```

#### 4. Calculating Minimum Floor Travel Time
The logic for `min_floor_time` is also correct:
- If `a_floor > b_floor`, the time is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` (wait time for lift).
- Otherwise, the time is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

This correctly accounts for the lift wait time and the time to travel between floors.

#### 5. Output
The function prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where `a_floor` and `b_floor` might be in different blocks.
- The function correctly handles the lift wait time.
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are in the same block but on different floors.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **True**

The function is logically sound and correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem statement.
