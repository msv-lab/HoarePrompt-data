The given code consists of two lines that do not depend on the initial state or each other in a way that would modify any variables. The first line prints `-1`, and the second line exits the program, effectively stopping any further execution.

Given this, the only information we can derive is the printed output, and no variables are updated or affected by the code. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the print statement.

Output State: **-1 is printed, i is 2, k is greater than 2, distance_to_travel is undefined, distance_to_fuel_station is undefined, distance_after_fuel_station is undefined**
