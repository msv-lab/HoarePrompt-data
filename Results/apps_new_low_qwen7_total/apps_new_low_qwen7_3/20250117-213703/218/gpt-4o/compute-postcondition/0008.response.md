The given code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement followed by an `exit()` function. This means the program will print `-1` and then terminate without further execution. Given the initial state and the nature of the code, no variables will be modified, and the state will remain unchanged after the execution of this block.

Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, refuels is an integer, fuel is an integer, total_distance is 2 * a * k, current_position is 0, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f, the value printed is -1**
