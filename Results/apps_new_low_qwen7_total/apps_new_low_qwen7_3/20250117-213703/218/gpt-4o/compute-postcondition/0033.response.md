Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `refuels` is 1, `fuel` is `b`, `distance_to_travel` is undefined, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is either `a - f` or `f`. If `fuel` is less than `distance_after_fuel_station`, `refuels` is incremented by 1 and `fuel` is set to `b`. Otherwise, no change is made to `refuels` and `fuel`.***
