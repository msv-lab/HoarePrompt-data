`fuel` is decremented by `distance_to_fuel_station`. If the initial value of `fuel` is less than `distance_to_fuel_station`, the condition `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station` is true, and the value of `fuel` remains `b`. In this case, the value printed is `-1`. If the initial value of `fuel` is greater than or equal to `distance_to_fuel_station`, the value of `fuel` becomes `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the output state depends on the initial value of `fuel` relative to `distance_to_fuel_station`.

- If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, then `fuel` remains `b`, and the value printed is `-1`.
- If `fuel >= distance_to_fuel_station`, then `fuel` becomes `a`.

Output State: **If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, then `fuel` remains `b`, and the value printed is `-1`; otherwise, `fuel` becomes `a`**.
