Output State: **refuels is 1, fuel is b, distance_to_travel is undefined, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is either a - f or f**

Explanation:
- The first line `refuels += 1` increments the value of `refuels` by 1. Since `refuels` was initially greater than 2 (though its exact initial value is not specified, it's at least 3), after this line, `refuels` becomes 1 more than its original value. However, without the exact initial value, we can only say `refuels` is 1.
- The second line `fuel = b` assigns the value of `b` to `fuel`. This updates the value of `fuel` to `b`.
- Variables `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, they remain in their initial undefined or conditional states as described in the precondition.
