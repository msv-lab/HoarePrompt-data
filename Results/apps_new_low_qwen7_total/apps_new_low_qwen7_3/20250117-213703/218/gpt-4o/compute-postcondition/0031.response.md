The code `fuel -= distance_to_fuel_station` subtracts the value of `distance_to_fuel_station` from `fuel`. Based on the initial state, `fuel` is greater than `distance_to_fuel_station` because if it was not, -1 would have been printed. Thus, `fuel -= distance_to_fuel_station` will simply reduce the value of `fuel` by `distance_to_fuel_station`.

The other variables (`i`, `k`, `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `fuel` is reduced by `distance_to_fuel_station`, `distance_to_travel` is undefined, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is either `a - f` or `f`.**
