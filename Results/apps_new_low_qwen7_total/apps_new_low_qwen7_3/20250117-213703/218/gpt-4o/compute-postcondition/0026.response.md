Output State: **i is 2, k is greater than 2, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is f, distance_after_fuel_station is a - f**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of variable `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line assigns the value of variable `f` to `distance_to_fuel_station`.
- The third line calculates the value of `a - f` and assigns it to `distance_after_fuel_station`.

No other variables were modified or declared, so their states remain as specified in the initial state: `i` is 2 and `k` must be greater than 2. The variables `a` and `f` are used but not defined or assigned values within the given code snippet, so they retain their symbolic nature in the final state.
