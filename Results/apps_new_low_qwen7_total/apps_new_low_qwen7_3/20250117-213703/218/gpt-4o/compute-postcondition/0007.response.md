Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `f`, `k`, `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, `current_position`, `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are integers. If `i` is even, `fuel` remains `b`, `total_distance` remains `2 * a * k`, `current_position` remains `0`, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`. If `i` is not even, `fuel` becomes `a`, `total_distance` remains `2 * a * k`, `current_position` becomes `a`, and other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `fuel` is lower than `distance_to_fuel_station`.***
