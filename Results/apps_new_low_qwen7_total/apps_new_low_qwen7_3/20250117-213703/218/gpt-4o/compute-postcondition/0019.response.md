The provided code consists of two lines:

1. `print(-1)`
2. `exit()`

These lines do not assign any new values to existing variables or create new ones. Instead, they perform the following actions:
- Line 1 prints `-1` to the console.
- Line 2 exits the program immediately after printing `-1`.

Since the code does not modify the values of any variables, the final state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **i is incremented by 1, k is greater than i, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is either a - f or f depending on whether the if condition i % 2 == 0 is true or false**
