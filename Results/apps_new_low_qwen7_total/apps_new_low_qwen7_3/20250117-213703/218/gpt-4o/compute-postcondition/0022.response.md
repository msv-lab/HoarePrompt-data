Output State: **i is incremented by 1, k is greater than i, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is either f or a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is either a - f or f depending on whether the if condition i % 2 == 0 is true or false, refuels is increased by 1, fuel is b**

Explanation:
- The first line `refuels += 1` increments the `refuels` variable by 1.
- The second line `fuel = b` sets the `fuel` variable to the value of `b`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `k`, `a`, `f`, and `b`, we keep these variables as they were initially defined. The changes are:
- `refuels` is increased by 1.
- `fuel` is set to `b`.

No other variables are affected by the given code block.
