Initial State: `i` is (previous value of `i` + 1), `k` must be greater than `i`

Code Snippet:
```
distance_to_travel = a
distance_to_fuel_station = a - f
distance_after_fuel_station = f
```

Analysis:
1. The first line sets `distance_to_travel` to the value of `a`.
2. The second line calculates `distance_to_fuel_station` as `a - f`.
3. The third line sets `distance_after_fuel_station` to the value of `f`.

These assignments do not affect the values of `i` or `k`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **i is (previous value of i + 1), k is greater than i, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**
