Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, refuels is 0, fuel is b, total_distance is 2 * a * k, current_position is 0**

Explanation:
- The first line reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` respectively. These values replace the initial states of `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`.
- The second line initializes `refuels` to 0.
- The third line sets `fuel` to the value of `b`.
- The fourth line calculates `total_distance` as `2 * a * k`.
- The fifth line initializes `current_position` to 0.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` are not provided in the code snippet, they remain as unspecified integers in the final state, except for `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, and `current_position` which are explicitly set to 0, `b`, `2 * a * k`, and 0 respectively.
