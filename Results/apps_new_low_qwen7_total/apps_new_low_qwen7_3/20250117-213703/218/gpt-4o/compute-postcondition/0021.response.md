`fuel` is decremented by `distance_to_fuel_station`. The value of `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, depending on the initial conditions. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` is greater than `i`, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is either `a - f` or `f` depending on whether the if condition `i % 2 == 0` is true or false, and `fuel` is decreased by `distance_to_fuel_station`.**
