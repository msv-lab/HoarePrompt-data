Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `k` is greater than `i`, `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is either `f` or `a - f`, `distance_after_fuel_station` is either `a - f` or `f` depending on whether the if condition `i % 2 == 0` is true or false, `refuels` is increased by 1, `fuel` is `b`, and the following conditions hold: 
- If `fuel < distance_after_fuel_station`, the function refuels and `fuel` becomes `b`.
- Otherwise, no change to `fuel` occurs.***
