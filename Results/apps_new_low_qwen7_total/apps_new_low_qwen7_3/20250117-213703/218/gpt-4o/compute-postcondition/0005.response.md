Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, k must be greater than 0, refuels is 0, fuel is a, total_distance is 2 * a * k, current_position is a, i is not even**

Explanation:
1. `distance_to_travel = a`: This line sets the value of `distance_to_travel` to the value of `a`.
2. `distance_to_fuel_station = a - f`: This line sets the value of `distance_to_fuel_station` to the value of `a - f`.
3. `distance_after_fuel_station = f`: This line sets the value of `distance_after_fuel_station` to the value of `f`.

After executing these lines, the following changes occur:
- `fuel` is updated to the value of `a` (since `fuel` was previously `b`, but it is reassigned to `a`).
- `distance_to_travel` is set to `a`.
- `distance_to_fuel_station` is calculated as `a - f`.
- `distance_after_fuel_station` is set to `f`.

The values of `a`, `b`, `f`, `k`, `refuels`, `total_distance`, `current_position`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not referenced or modified in the code block.
