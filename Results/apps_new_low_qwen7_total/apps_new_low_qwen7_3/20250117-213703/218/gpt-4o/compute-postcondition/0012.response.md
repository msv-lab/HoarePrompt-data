Output State: **refuels is 1, fuel is b, distance_to_fuel_station is compared with distance_after_fuel_station** 

Explanation:
- The first line `refuels += 1` increments the value of `refuels` by 1. Since `refuels` was initially set by `fuel` becoming `a`, and assuming `a` is an integer, `refuels` is now 1.
- The second line `fuel = b` sets the value of `fuel` to `b`. The comparison between `distance_to_fuel_station` and `distance_after_fuel_station` does not affect any variables and is only used to decide whether to print `-1` or not. However, since the outcome of the comparison is not relevant to the final state (as per the given code block), we do not change `distance_to_fuel_station` or `distance_after_fuel_station`.

Note: The value of `b` is not specified, so it remains as `b` in the output state.
