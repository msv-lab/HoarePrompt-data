The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` starts from 1 and needs to be incremented by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

So, the updated states are:
- `i` is 2
- `k` must be greater than 2

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2**
