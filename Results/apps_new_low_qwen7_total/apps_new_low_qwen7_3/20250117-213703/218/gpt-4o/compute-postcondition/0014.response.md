Output State: **fuel is updated, distance_after_fuel_station is updated, current_position is (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)**

Explanation:
1. The first line `fuel -= distance_after_fuel_station` updates the value of `fuel` by subtracting `distance_after_fuel_station` from it.
2. The second line `current_position = (current_position + distance_to_travel) % (2 * a)` updates the value of `current_position` by adding `distance_to_travel` to it and then taking the modulus with `2 * a`.

Since the exact values of `fuel`, `distance_after_fuel_station`, `current_position`, and `distance_to_travel` are not provided, we can only describe the changes in terms of their relationships. The `current_position` is updated based on the addition of `distance_to_travel` and then taken modulo `2 * a`. The `fuel` is updated by subtracting `distance_after_fuel_station` from it. No other variables are affected by the given code block.
