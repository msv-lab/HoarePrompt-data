To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the `for` loop and the conditions necessary for the loop to start.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(k):`, which means the loop variable `i` takes values from 0 to `k-1`.

2. **Initialization of Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.
   - For the first iteration of the loop, this condition should be satisfied: `0 < k`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k` are used to initialize the loop but are not directly controlling the loop's execution.
   - `refuels`, `fuel`, `total_distance`, and `current_position` are initialized but do not affect the loop's execution condition.

5. **State Before the Loop:**
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `f` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `refuels` is 0.
   - `fuel` is `b`.
   - `total_distance` is `2 * a * k`.
   - `current_position` is 0.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < k` must be true. Since `i` starts at 0, the condition `0 < k` must be true. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `refuels` is 0, `fuel` is `b`, `total_distance` is `2 * a * k`, `current_position` is 0**
