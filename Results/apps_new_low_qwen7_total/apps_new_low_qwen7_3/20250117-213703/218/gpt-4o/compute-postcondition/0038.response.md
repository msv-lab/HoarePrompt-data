Functionality: **The function processes a series of trips along a circular path of length \(2a\) where a vehicle starts with an initial fuel capacity \(b\). For each trip, the vehicle travels a distance of \(a\) and stops at either a fuel station located at distance \(f\) from the start or its opposite point. If the fuel is insufficient before reaching the fuel station, the vehicle must refuel to full capacity \(b\). The function calculates and prints the number of times the vehicle needs to refuel during \(k\) trips.**

- The function accepts four integer inputs: \(a\), \(b\), \(f\), and \(k\), representing the half-length of the path, initial fuel capacity, fuel station distance, and number of trips, respectively.
- The function does not return any value.
- After executing the function, the following state will be observed:
  - The variable `refuels` will hold the total number of refuels required to complete \(k\) trips.
  - The variable `fuel` will hold the remaining fuel after completing \(k\) trips, which is `b - 2 * (distance_to_fuel_station + distance_after_fuel_station) * (k // 2)` if no refuels occur, or adjusted for each refuel event.
  - The variable `current_position` will represent the position of the vehicle after completing \(k\) trips, calculated modulo \(2a\).

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the initial fuel \(b\) is less than the distance to the nearest fuel station (`f` or \(a-f\)), the function will immediately print `-1` and exit, indicating an impossible scenario where the vehicle cannot complete even one trip without refueling.
- If the vehicle reaches the fuel station with zero fuel, it will refuel, but the remaining fuel after the refuel might still be insufficient for the next leg of the trip, leading to another refuel event. This scenario is correctly handled by the code.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not explicitly check for the case where the vehicle reaches the fuel station with exactly zero fuel, but due to the nature of the modulo operation and the structure of the loops, this condition is inherently covered within the existing logic.
