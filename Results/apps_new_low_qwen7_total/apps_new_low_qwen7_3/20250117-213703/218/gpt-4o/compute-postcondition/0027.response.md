Output State: **i is 2, k must be greater than 2, distance_to_travel is a, distance_to_fuel_station is a - f, distance_after_fuel_station is f**

Explanation:
- The first line assigns the value of `a` to `distance_to_travel`.
- The second line calculates `distance_to_fuel_station` as `a - f`.
- The third line sets `distance_after_fuel_station` to `f`.

No other variables were affected by the code block, and the precondition that `k` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values for `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station`, while keeping the initial values of `i` and the condition on `k`.
