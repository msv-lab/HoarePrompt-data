Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 2. If `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station`, then -1 is printed, and `distance_to_travel`, `distance_to_fuel_station`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` are undefined. Otherwise, `distance_to_travel` is defined as `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is defined as either `f` or `a - f` based on the condition `i % 2 == 0`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is defined as either `a - f` or `f` based on the condition `i % 2 == 0`.***
