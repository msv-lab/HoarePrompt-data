The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` compared to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

Given that `fuel` and `distance_after_fuel_station` were updated but are not part of the loop head, and `current_position` is derived from the loop body but not directly part of the loop head, we need to focus on adjusting `i` and `k`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `k`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `i` and `k` from the previous iteration, we can only express the state in terms of these variables.

State: **`i` is (previous value of `i` + 1), `k` must be greater than `i`**
