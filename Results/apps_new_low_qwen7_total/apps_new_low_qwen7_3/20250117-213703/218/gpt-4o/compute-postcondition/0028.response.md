Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 2. If `i % 2 == 0`, then `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `a - f`. If the condition `i % 2 == 0` is not met, then `distance_to_travel` is `a`, `distance_to_fuel_station` is `a - f`, and `distance_after_fuel_station` is `f`.***
