The function processes a series of trips along a circular path of length \(2a\) where a vehicle starts with an initial fuel capacity \(b\). For each trip, the vehicle travels a distance of \(a\) and stops at either a fuel station located at distance \(f\) from the start or its opposite point. If the fuel is insufficient before reaching the fuel station, the vehicle must refuel to full capacity \(b\). The function calculates and prints the number of times the vehicle needs to refuel during \(k\) trips.
