### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(f\), and \(k\) from the input.
   - It initializes `refuels` to 0, `fuel` to `b`, and `total_distance` to \(2 \times a \times k\).
   - `current_position` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Through Journeys:**
   - The program iterates `k` times, simulating each journey.
   - For even-indexed journeys (`i % 2 == 0`), the bus travels from 0 to \(a\) and then from \(a\) to \(f\).
   - For odd-indexed journeys (`i % 2 != 0`), the bus travels from \(a\) to 0 and then from 0 to \(f\).

3. **Fuel Calculation:**
   - The program checks if there is enough fuel to reach the gas station (`distance_to_fuel_station`).
   - If not enough fuel, it prints `-1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it deducts the fuel needed to reach the gas station.
   - After reaching the gas station, if there is not enough fuel to complete the remaining part of the journey, it refuels and deducts the necessary fuel.

4. **Position Update:**
   - The position is updated modulo \(2 \times a\) to account for the round trip.

5. **Output:**
   - After completing all journeys, it prints the number of refuels.

Given the detailed analysis, the logic appears to correctly simulate the bus's journey and refueling process, taking into account the constraints of fuel consumption and the position of the gas station.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the code and understanding its logic, the program seems to accurately implement the solution to the problem as described.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
Correctness: True
