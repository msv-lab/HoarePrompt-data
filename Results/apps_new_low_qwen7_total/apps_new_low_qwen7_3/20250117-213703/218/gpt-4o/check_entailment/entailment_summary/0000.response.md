Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Logic**: The program iterates through each journey and checks if the bus needs to refuel based on the remaining fuel and the distance to the fuel station.
2. **Even and Odd Journeys**: The logic correctly handles both even and odd journeys by adjusting the distances to travel and the position of the fuel station.
3. **Fuel Calculation**: The program correctly reduces the fuel after each leg of the journey and checks if refueling is necessary.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the position is correctly handled for the circular path.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the fuel is insufficient before reaching the fuel station by printing `-1` and exiting.

Given these points, the program appears to follow the problem description and the execution summary accurately.

Correctness: **True**
