You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A bus moves along the coordinate line Ox from the point x = 0 to the point x = a. After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a, immediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to the point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x = a or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make k journeys.

The petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.

There is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and x = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain b liters of gasoline.

What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point x = f to make k journeys? The first journey starts in the point x = 0.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to make k journeys, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 9 2 4

Output
4

Input
6 10 2 4

Output
2

Input
6 5 4 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey.

In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. 

In the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling.

    print(refuels)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of trips along a circular path of length \(2a\) where a vehicle starts with an initial fuel capacity \(b\). For each trip, the vehicle travels a distance of \(a\) and stops at either a fuel station located at distance \(f\) from the start or its opposite point. If the fuel is insufficient before reaching the fuel station, the vehicle must refuel to full capacity \(b\). The function calculates and prints the number of times the vehicle needs to refuel during \(k\) trips.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(f\), and \(k\) from the input.
   - It initializes `refuels` to 0, `fuel` to `b`, and `total_distance` to \(2 \times a \times k\).
   - `current_position` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Through Journeys:**
   - The program iterates `k` times, simulating each journey.
   - For even-indexed journeys (`i % 2 == 0`), the bus travels from 0 to \(a\) and then from \(a\) to \(f\).
   - For odd-indexed journeys (`i % 2 != 0`), the bus travels from \(a\) to 0 and then from 0 to \(f\).

3. **Fuel Calculation:**
   - The program checks if there is enough fuel to reach the gas station (`distance_to_fuel_station`).
   - If not enough fuel, it prints `-1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it deducts the fuel needed to reach the gas station.
   - After reaching the gas station, if there is not enough fuel to complete the remaining part of the journey, it refuels and deducts the necessary fuel.

4. **Position Update:**
   - The position is updated modulo \(2 \times a\) to account for the round trip.

5. **Output:**
   - After completing all journeys, it prints the number of refuels.

Given the detailed analysis, the logic appears to correctly simulate the bus's journey and refueling process, taking into account the constraints of fuel consumption and the position of the gas station.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the code and understanding its logic, the program seems to accurately implement the solution to the problem as described.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
Correctness: True
```
