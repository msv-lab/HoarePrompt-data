### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly initializes variables and reads input values for `a`, `b`, `f`, and `k`.

2. **Fuel Calculation and Refueling Logic:**
   - The program calculates the total distance that needs to be traveled for `k` journeys, which is `2 * a * k`.
   - For each journey, it correctly calculates the distances to and from the gas station (`distance_to_fuel_station` and `distance_after_fuel_station`).
   - It checks if the current fuel is sufficient to reach the gas station. If not, it prints `-1` and exits, indicating that it's impossible to complete the required journeys.
   - When the fuel is insufficient, it refuels the tank to `b` liters and increments the `refuels` counter.

3. **Position Update:**
   - The program updates the current position after each journey using modulo arithmetic to handle the round trip nature of the bus's movement.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the total number of refuels required.

### Analysis:

- The logic for determining whether the bus needs to refuel and how many times it needs to do so is sound.
- The program correctly handles the case where the bus cannot complete all journeys due to insufficient fuel.
- The calculations and logic are consistent with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:

Given the provided code and the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
