Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of refuels needed for the bus to make k journeys. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a refuel is needed is flawed. The program checks if `fuel < distance_to_fuel_station` and `fuel < distance_after_fuel_station` separately, which does not accurately reflect the bus's fuel usage and remaining distance. Additionally, the calculation of `current_position` using modulo operation is unnecessary for this problem.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
6 9 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
-1
```

This happens because the program incorrectly checks if there is enough fuel to reach the gas station without considering the remaining distance after the turn. The program fails to account for the fact that the bus can make multiple journeys before needing to refuel, and it does not properly handle the refueling logic for odd and even numbered journeys.
