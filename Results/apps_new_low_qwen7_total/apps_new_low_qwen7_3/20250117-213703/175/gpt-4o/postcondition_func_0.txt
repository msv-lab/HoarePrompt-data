The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. The function checks whether there is at least one 0 in the list `a` and ensures that there is at least one 1 before the first 0. If both conditions are met, it constructs a string based on the sequence of 1s and 0s in the list, and prints this string. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
