To determine the state of the objects at the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions given in the for loop and how they relate to the initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):`
   - This means the loop will start iterating over the range from `first_zero_index + 1` to `n`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is 5.
   - `first_zero_index` is 0.
   - `i` is 0 (though this value will change within the loop).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is in the range from `first_zero_index + 1` to `n`.
   - Substituting the values, the range becomes `range(0 + 1, 5)` which simplifies to `range(1, 5)`.

4. **First Iteration**:
   - For the first iteration, `i` should be the smallest integer in the range, which is 1.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be such that the condition `i == 1` is satisfied when the loop begins.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `first_zero_index`, `a`, `result`) do not directly control the loop's execution based on the given loop condition. They are initialized but do not affect the loop's starting condition.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to 1. The other variables can remain in their initial states because they do not influence the loop's starting condition.

### Final State:

State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` must be 1, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is []**
