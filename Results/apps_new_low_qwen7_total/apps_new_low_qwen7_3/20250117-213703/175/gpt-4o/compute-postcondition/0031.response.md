Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. The function checks whether there is at least one 0 in the list `a` and ensures that there is at least one 1 before the first 0. If both conditions are met, it constructs a string based on the sequence of 1s and 0s in the list, and prints this string. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads the length `n` of the list `a` from input.
2. Reads the list `a` of integers from input.
3. Checks if there is at least one 0 in the list and if there is at least one 1 before the first 0.
4. If both conditions are satisfied, it constructs a string `result` by iterating over the elements of `a`:
   - Appends '0->' if the current index is between the first occurrence of 1 and the first occurrence of 0 (inclusive of the first 1 and exclusive of the first 0).
   - Appends the binary value of the current element followed by '->' for elements between the first occurrence of 1 and the first occurrence of 0 (inclusive of the first 1 and exclusive of the first 0).
   - Appends '(', the binary value of the first 0, and ')'.
   - Appends '->' followed by the binary value of the current element for elements after the first 0.
5. Prints the constructed string `result`.
6. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'.

**Edge Cases:**
- If there are no 0s in the list, the function will print 'NO'.
- If there are no 1s before the first 0, the function will print 'NO'.
- If the list contains only 1s, the function will print 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-binary values. These should be considered as invalid inputs and should result in the function printing 'NO'.
