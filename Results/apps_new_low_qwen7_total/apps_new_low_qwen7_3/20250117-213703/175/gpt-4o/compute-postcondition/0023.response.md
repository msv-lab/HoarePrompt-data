Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `first_zero_index`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `first_zero_index` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `first_one_index` is 3
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - `result` is ['->0']

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `first_zero_index + 1` to `n`. In this case, it starts from `0 + 1` to `5`, which means it iterates from `1` to `5`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `n` is 5, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `4`.

6. **Adjusting Other Variables**:
   - Since `i` is the only variable directly involved in the loop condition and the loop head, other variables like `first_zero_index`, `first_one_index`, `a`, and `result` do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

7. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `first_zero_index` remains 0.
   - `first_one_index` remains 3.
   - `a` remains [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].
   - `result` remains ['->0'].

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 4, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is ['->0']**
