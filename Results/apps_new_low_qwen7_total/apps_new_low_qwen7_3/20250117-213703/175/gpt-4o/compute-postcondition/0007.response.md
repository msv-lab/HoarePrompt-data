Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(first_one_index)` statement. This means that the variable `i` will iterate over the range from `0` to `first_one_index - 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - `first_one_index` must be greater than 0
   - `first_zero_index` is 0
   - `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->']
   - `i` is 2

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `first_one_index`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute again, `first_one_index` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `first_one_index`.
   - Since `i` is 2, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.
   - Therefore, `first_one_index` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 3, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->'], `i` is 3**
