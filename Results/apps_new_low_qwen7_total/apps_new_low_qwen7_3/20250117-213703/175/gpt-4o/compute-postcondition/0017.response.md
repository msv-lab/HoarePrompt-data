Let's analyze the given Python loop and track the changes in the variables step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

The loop iterates over a range defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. Specifically, it appends the binary value of elements in array `a` at each index between `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` (exclusive) to the `result` list.

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Invariants:**
  - `n` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop or any modification within the loop.
  - `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified inside the loop.
  - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are not updated within the loop; hence, they remain constant.

- **Variables affected by the loop:**
  - `i`: This variable changes with each iteration and is used to access elements in the array `a`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

The loop will execute as long as `first_one_index < first_zero_index`. For each iteration, it appends the binary value of `a[i]` followed by `'->'` to `result`.

Given the provided outputs, we can infer the following:
- After the loop has executed, `i` takes the value of the last index processed, which is `first_zero_index - 1`.
- The loop stops when `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

From the outputs provided:
- After 1 execution: `i` becomes 2 (since `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` goes up to 2).
- After 2 executions: `i` becomes 3 (since `first_zero_index` is still 3, `i` goes up to 3).
- After 3 executions: `i` becomes 4 (since `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` would go up to 4 but stops).

This indicates that the loop will stop when `i` equals `first_zero_index - 1`, which is 2 in the initial state. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly twice.

### Final Output State

Since the loop executes twice and appends the binary values of the specified indices in `a` to `result`, the final `result` list will contain the appended values for the indices between `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` (inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end).

Given the initial state:
- `a` = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
- `first_one_index` = 3
- `first_zero_index` = 0

The indices to append are 3 and 4:
- `a[3]` is 0
- `a[4]` is 1

Thus, the final `result` will be:
- `result` = ['0->', '1->', '0->', '1->']

### Output State: `n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 3, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 4, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '0->', '1->']
