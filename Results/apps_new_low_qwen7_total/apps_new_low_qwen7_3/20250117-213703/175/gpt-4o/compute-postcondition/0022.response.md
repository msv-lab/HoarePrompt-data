The code appends the string `'->' + str(a[i])` to the list `result`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, and the current value of `result` is `['->0']`, the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 3) is `0`. So, `'->' + str(a[i])` evaluates to `'->0'`. Since `result` already contains `'->0'`, appending `'->0'` again does not change its value.

Therefore, the updated `result` remains `['->0']`.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 3, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is ['->0']**
