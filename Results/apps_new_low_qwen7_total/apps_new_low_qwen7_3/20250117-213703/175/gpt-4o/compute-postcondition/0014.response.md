`result` is a list that is being used in the code, but its initial state is not provided. We append `str(a[i]) + '->'` to `result`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]`, which is `0`. So, `str(a[i])` is `str(0)`, which is `'0'`. Therefore, `'0->'` is appended to `result`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 3, `result` is ['0->']**
