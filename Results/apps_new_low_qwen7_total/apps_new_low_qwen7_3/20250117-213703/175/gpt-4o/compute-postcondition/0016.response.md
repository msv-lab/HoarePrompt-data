The code appends a new element to the list `result`. Specifically, it appends the string representation of `a[i]` concatenated with `'->'` to `result`. Given that `i` is 4, `a[i]` (which is `a[4]`) is 1.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial value of `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
2. `i` is 4, so `a[i]` (or `a[4]`) is 1.
3. `result` initially contains `['0->']`.
4. After running the code, `result` becomes `['0->', '1->']`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is 5, `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, and `i` is still 4.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 4, `result` is ['0->', '1->']**
