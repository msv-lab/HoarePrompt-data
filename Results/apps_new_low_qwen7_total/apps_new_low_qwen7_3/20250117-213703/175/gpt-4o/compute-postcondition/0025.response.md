### Analysis

#### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from `first_zero_index + 1` up to `n - 1`. Inside the loop, it appends a string to the `result` list by combining `'->'` and the value of `a[i]`.

#### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
- **Invariant Variables**:
  - `n`: The length of the list `a`, which remains unchanged.
  - `first_zero_index`: Remains 0 because the loop only iterates over positions where `a[i]` is 1.
  - `first_one_index`: Remains 3 because it was initialized this way and the loop does not update it.
  - `a`: The list `a` itself does not change within the loop.
- **Variables that Change**:
  - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration.
  - `result`: Grows with each iteration by appending a new string.

#### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- Each iteration appends `a[i]` to `result` as a string prefixed by `'->'`.
- The loop stops when `i` reaches `n`.

#### Step 4: Verify Relationships
- After the first iteration (`i` becomes 1), `result` becomes `['->0']`.
- After the second iteration (`i` becomes 2), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1']`.
- After the third iteration (`i` becomes 3), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1', '->0']`.
- After the fourth iteration (`i` becomes 4), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1']`.

Since `n` is 5 and the loop increments `i` until it equals `n`, the loop will execute 4 times in total.

### Final Output State
- `n` remains 5.
- `first_zero_index` remains 0.
- `i` will be 4 after the last iteration.
- `first_one_index` remains 3.
- `a` remains `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- `result` will contain `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']`.

### Output State: 
n is 5, first_zero_index is 0, i is 4, first_one_index is 3, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], result is ['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']
