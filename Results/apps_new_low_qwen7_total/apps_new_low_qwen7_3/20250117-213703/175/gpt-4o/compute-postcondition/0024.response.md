The code appends a new element `'->' + str(a[i])` to the list `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`. So, `a[i]` (which is `a[4]`) is `1`. The new element appended to `result` will be `'->1'`.

- `result` initially is `['->0']`.
- After appending `'->1'`, `result` becomes `['->0', '->1']`.

No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 4, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is ['->0', '->1']**
