The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by "->" to the list `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is not specified in the code snippet, but we know `i` should be within the range of indices of `a`, which is from 0 to 4.

Let's assume `i` starts at 0 (since it's the first index and the loop will continue as long as `first_one_index` is greater than 0). So, `a[0]` is 0.

The code will append "0->" to `result`.

After this operation:
- `result` will be `['0->']`.
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- The loop condition checks if `first_one_index` is greater than 0. Since `first_one_index` is initially set to a value greater than 0, the loop continues.

Since `a[1]` is 1, the next iteration will append "1->" to `result`.

After this operation:
- `result` will be `['0->', '1->']`.
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- The loop condition checks if `first_one_index` is greater than 0. Since `first_one_index` is still set to a value greater than 0, the loop continues.

Since `a[2]` is 1, the next iteration will append "1->" to `result`.

After this operation:
- `result` will be `['0->', '1->', '1->']`.
- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- The loop condition checks if `first_one_index` is greater than 0. Since `first_one_index` is still set to a value greater than 0, the loop continues.

Since `a[3]` is 0, the next iteration will append "0->" to `result`.

After this operation:
- `result` will be `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->']`.
- `i` will be incremented to 4.
- The loop condition checks if `first_one_index` is greater than 0. Since `first_one_index` is still set to a value greater than 0, the loop continues.

Since `a[4]` is 1, the next iteration will append "1->" to `result`.

After this operation:
- `result` will be `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->']`.
- `i` will be incremented to 5, which is out of the bounds of the list `a`.

Therefore, the loop terminates.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 0, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->']**
