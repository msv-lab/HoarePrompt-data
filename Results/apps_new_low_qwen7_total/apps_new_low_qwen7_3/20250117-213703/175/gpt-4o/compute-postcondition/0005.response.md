Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `first_one_index`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `first_one_index`.

3. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - `first_one_index` must be greater than 0
   - `first_zero_index` is 0
   - `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->']

4. **Determine the current value of `i` and `first_one_index`**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(first_one_index)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been set to `first_one_index - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` is `first_one_index - 1`.

5. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `first_one_index`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be equal to `first_one_index`.
   - Since `i` is now equal to `first_one_index`, the loop will stop executing.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to `first_one_index`.
   - `first_one_index` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop.

Given this reasoning, the states to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

**State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 0, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->'], `i` is `first_one_index`**
