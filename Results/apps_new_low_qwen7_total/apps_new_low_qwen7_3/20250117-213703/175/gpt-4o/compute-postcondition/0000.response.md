The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1.

The code snippet provided reads:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Let's assume we provide the following input for the purpose of this example (the actual input can vary):
- For `n`, we enter `5`.
- For the list of integers, we enter `1 0 1 0 1`.

After executing the code, the following happens:
1. The first line `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. Let's assume `n` is read as `5`.
2. The second line `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them to a list of integers. Let's assume the input for this line is `1 0 1 0 1`, so `a` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.

Given these inputs, after running the code, the values of `n` and `a` are updated. The final state is:
Output State: **n is 5, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]**
