To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(first_one_index, first_zero_index)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over the indices starting from `first_one_index` up to but not including `first_zero_index`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `first_one_index` is 3.
   - `first_zero_index` is 0.

Given these initial values, we need to check if the loop can execute at all because `first_one_index` (3) is greater than `first_zero_index` (0). 

Since `first_one_index` (3) is greater than `first_zero_index` (0), the range `range(first_one_index, first_zero_index)` results in an empty range. Therefore, the loop will not execute even once because there are no valid indices in the specified range.

However, if we consider the problem as stated, where the loop might be expected to execute under certain conditions, we should focus on what would need to change for the loop to be executable.

For the loop to execute at least once, `first_one_index` must be less than `first_zero_index`. Additionally, the value of `i` in the first iteration of the loop should be within the range defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`.

Since the current values do not allow the loop to execute, let's assume we need to adjust the values such that the loop can start.

**Adjusted State**:
- `first_one_index` should be less than `first_zero_index` for the loop to execute at least once.
- The value of `i` in the first iteration would be `first_one_index`, which is 3 in this case.

Therefore, the state before the loop must be adjusted such that `first_one_index` is less than `first_zero_index`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->', '(']**
