Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range specified by `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - `first_one_index` is 0
   - `first_zero_index` is 3
   - `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '0->', '1->']

3. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `first_one_index` to `first_zero_index`. Given `first_one_index` is 0 and `first_zero_index` is 3, the loop will run for `i` values 0, 1, and 2.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since the loop is running from 0 to 2, the last value of `i` processed would be 2. Therefore, `i` at the end of the previous iteration is 2.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `first_zero_index`. Since `i` was 2 and `first_zero_index` is 3, the loop can still execute one more time with `i` being 3.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Other states remain unchanged**: The other states (`n`, `a`, `first_one_index`, `first_zero_index`, and `result`) do not change based on the loop condition alone.

**Final state for the next iteration**:
- `n` is 5
- `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
- `first_one_index` is 0
- `first_zero_index` is 3
- `i` is 3

State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 3**
