Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(first_one_index):`
   - This means that the value of `i` will take on values from 0 up to but not including `first_one_index`.
   - Therefore, the key variables here are `i`, `first_one_index`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `n` is given as 5 (though `n` is not directly involved in this loop).
   - `a` is given as `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
   - `first_one_index` is currently 0.
   - `first_zero_index` is currently 0.
   - `result` is currently an empty list `[]`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `first_one_index` must be greater than 0 because the loop iterates from 0 up to but not including `first_one_index`.
   - If `first_one_index` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Ensure the Correct Initial Values:**
   - Since we want the loop to execute at least once, we need `first_one_index` to be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `first_one_index` is currently 0, so it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

5. **State After Adjustment:**
   - `n` remains 5.
   - We adjust `first_one_index` to be greater than 0 (let's say `first_one_index` is set to 1 for the first iteration).

Therefore, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time must be:

**State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 0, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is []**
