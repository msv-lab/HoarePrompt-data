Postcondition: ***`n` is 5, `a` is a list of integers, and depending on the condition, either the following happens: 
- If 0 is in `a` and the number of 1s in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is greater than 0, the result is a list `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']` and a string `'->0->1->0->1->0'` is printed.
- If 0 is in `a` but the number of 1s in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is not greater than 0, the same list `a` is maintained and no specific changes or prints are mentioned.***
