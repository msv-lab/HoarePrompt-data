The code appends the value of '->' concatenated with `str(a[i])` to the list `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`, which is 0. The `result` list is appended with the string '->0'. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 2, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is ['->0']**
