The initial state is:
- `n` is 5
- `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`

The value 0 exists in the list `a`, and the count of 1's in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is indeed greater than 0 (since `a[:2]` contains two 1's).

Now, let's execute the provided code block:

```python
print('YES')
result = []
first_one_index = a.index(1)
first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index
```

### Analysis of Each Line:

1. `print('YES')`: This line prints 'YES' to the console but does not affect any variables.

2. `result = []`: This line creates an empty list `result` and does not modify any existing variables.

3. `first_one_index = a.index(1)`: This line finds the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a` and assigns it to `first_one_index`. Since `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, `first_one_index` is 0.

4. `first_zero_index = a[first_one_index:].index(0) + first_one_index`: This line first slices `a` from the `first_one_index` (which is 0) to the end, resulting in `[0, 1, 0, 1]`. Then, it finds the index of the first 0 in this sliced list, which is 0. Adding `first_one_index` (0) to this index gives `first_zero_index` the value of 0.

### Final Output State:

After executing the entire code block, the following variables are updated:
- `n` remains unchanged at 5.
- `a` remains unchanged at `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- `first_one_index` is set to 0.
- `first_zero_index` is set to 0.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **n is 5, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], first_one_index is 0, first_zero_index is 0, result is []**
