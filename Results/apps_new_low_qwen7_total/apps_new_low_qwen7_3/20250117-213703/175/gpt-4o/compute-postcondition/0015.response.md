Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `first_one_index`, and `first_zero_index`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. Specifically, the condition is `first_one_index <= i < first_zero_index`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 5 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `first_one_index` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `first_zero_index` is 3 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 3 (relevant to the loop head)
   - `result` is ['0->'] (not relevant to the loop head)

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - However, `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `first_zero_index`. Since `first_zero_index` must still be 3 for the loop to execute one more time (as `i` should be less than `first_zero_index`), and `i` will be incremented to 4, the new state is:

State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 0, `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` is 4, `result` is ['0->']**
