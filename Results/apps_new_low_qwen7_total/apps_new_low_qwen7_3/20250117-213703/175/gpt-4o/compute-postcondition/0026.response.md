The given code snippet appends strings to the `result` list and then joins these strings to form a single string. Let's analyze the impact of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 5.
   - `first_zero_index` is 0.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `first_one_index` is 3.
   - `a` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
   - `result` is `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(result))
   ```

   - The `join` method concatenates all elements in the `result` list into a single string using the specified delimiter (`''` in this case, which means no delimiter).
   - The `result` list contains `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']`.
   - The `join` operation will concatenate these strings to form the string `->0->1->0->1->0`.

3. **Output:**
   - The string `->0->1->0->1->0` is printed.

4. **Updated State:**
   - The variables `n`, `first_zero_index`, `i`, `first_one_index`, and `a` remain unchanged.
   - The `result` list is no longer needed as its content has been printed.

### Output State:
**n is 5, first_zero_index is 0, i is 4, first_one_index is 3, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], result is ['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0'], printed string is '->0->1->0->1->0'**
