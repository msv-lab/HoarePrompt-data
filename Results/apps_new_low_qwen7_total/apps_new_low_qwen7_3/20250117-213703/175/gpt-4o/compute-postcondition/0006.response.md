`result` is appended with the string formed by `str(a[i]) + '->'`. Given that `i` is equal to `first_one_index` and `first_one_index` is greater than 0, `i` must be 2 (since `a` has indices starting from 0 and the first one index must be greater than 0). Therefore, `a[i]` is 1. So, the appended string is `'1->'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 0, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->'], `i` is 2**
