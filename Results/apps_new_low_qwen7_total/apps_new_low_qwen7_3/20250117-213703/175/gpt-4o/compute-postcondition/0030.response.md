The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers named `a`. The list `a` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and each element `a_i` in the list is either 0 or 1. The function returns the count of 1s in the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, and return the count of 1s in the list.
