Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is 5
   - `first_zero_index` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `first_one_index` is 3
   - `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   - `result` is ['->0']

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n)`.
   - `first_zero_index + 1` is `0 + 1 = 1`
   - So, the loop iterates over `range(1, 5)`.

4. **Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (the next value in the range).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `3` because it must be within the range `1` to `4`.
   - `n` remains `5` as it is not affected by the loop itself.

6. **Other Variables**: 
   - `first_zero_index`, `first_one_index`, `a`, and `result` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is 5

So, the updated state is:
State: **`n` is 5, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 3, `first_one_index` is 3, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `result` is ['->0']**
