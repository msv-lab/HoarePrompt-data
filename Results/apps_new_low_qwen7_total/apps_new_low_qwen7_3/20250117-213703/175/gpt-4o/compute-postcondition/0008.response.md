In the given code snippet, the `result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')` statement appends a string to the `result` list. The string being appended is the value of `a[i]` (converted to a string) concatenated with `'->'`. Given the current state, `i` is 3, so the value of `a[3]` is 0. Therefore, the string to be appended is `'0->'`.

Let's update the variables:
- `n` remains unchanged, so it is still 5.
- `a` remains unchanged, so it is still `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- `first_one_index` remains unchanged, so it must still be greater than 3.
- `first_zero_index` remains unchanged, so it is still 0.
- `result` will now include the string `'0->'` appended to its current value.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 4.

The updated state of the variables after the code execution is:
- `n` is 5
- `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
- `first_one_index` must be greater than 3
- `first_zero_index` is 0
- `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->', '0->']
- `i` is 4

Output State: **`n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` must be greater than 3, `first_zero_index` is 0, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->', '0->'], `i` is 4**
