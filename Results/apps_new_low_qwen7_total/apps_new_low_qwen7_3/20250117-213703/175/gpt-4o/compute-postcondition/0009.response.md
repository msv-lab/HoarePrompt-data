Let's analyze the given Python loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is 5
- `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
- `first_one_index` is 0
- `first_zero_index` is 0
- `result` is []

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(first_one_index):
    result.append(str(a[i]) + '->')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` is 0, so the range is `range(0)` which means no iteration.
   - Therefore, `result` remains unchanged as `[]`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` is still 0, but since the loop condition `i < first_one_index` evaluates to `False`, no iteration occurs again.
   - Thus, `result` remains unchanged as `[]`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start. Here, it is not, so no iteration occurs.
   - The loop will continue until `first_one_index` becomes greater than 0.

4. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` is now 1 (since the first 1 in the array is at index 0, and we set `first_one_index` to 1 if it was not already greater than 0).
   - The loop iterates through `range(1)`, appending '0->' to `result`.
   - After this iteration, `result` is `['0->']`.
   - `i` is 0.

5. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented to 1, and `result` is `['0->', '1->']`.
   - `i` is now 1, and the loop stops because `i == first_one_index`.

6. **Sixth Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` is 1, so the range is `range(1)`.
   - The loop appends '1->' to `result`.
   - After this iteration, `result` is `['0->', '1->', '1->']`.
   - `i` is 2.

7. **Seventh Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented to 3, and `result` is `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->']`.
   - `i` is now 3, and the loop stops because `i == first_one_index`.

8. **Eighth Iteration:**
   - `first_one_index` is 3, so the range is `range(3)`.
   - The loop appends '1->' to `result`.
   - After this iteration, `result` is `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->']`.
   - `i` is 4.

9. **Ninth Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented to 5, and `result` is `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.
   - `i` is now 5, and the loop stops because `i == first_one_index`.

### Final State
- `n` remains 5.
- `a` remains [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].
- `first_one_index` is now 3 (as it was updated in the loop logic).
- `first_zero_index` remains 0.
- `result` is `['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->']`.

### Output State
Output State: **n is 5, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], first_one_index is 3, first_zero_index is 0, result is ['0->', '1->', '1->', '0->', '1->', '1->'].**
