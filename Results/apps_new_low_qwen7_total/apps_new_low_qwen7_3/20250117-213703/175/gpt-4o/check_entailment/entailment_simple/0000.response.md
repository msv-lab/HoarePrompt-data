### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given annotated program to understand its logic and correctness.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of arguments.
   - It then reads `n` integers from input and stores them in the list `a`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if there is at least one `0` in `a` and whether the number of `1`s before the first `0` is greater than 0.
   - If this condition is true, the program attempts to construct a valid logical expression with brackets such that the entire expression evaluates to `0`.

3. **Expression Construction:**
   - If the condition is met, the program constructs the expression as follows:
     - It finds the index of the first `0` and the index of the first `1` before the first `0`.
     - It constructs a part of the expression to ensure the first part evaluates to `1` and the rest evaluates to `0`.
     - The constructed expression is then printed.

4. **Else Condition:**
   - If the condition is not met, the program prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:

1. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if (0 in a and a[:a.index(0)].count(1) > 0)` ensures that the first part of the expression can be made to evaluate to `1` while the rest evaluates to `0`.
   - If there is no `0` or the number of `1`s before the first `0` is `0`, the condition fails, and the program correctly prints "NO".

2. **Expression Construction:**
   - The construction of the expression ensures that the first part evaluates to `1` and the rest evaluates to `0`.
   - The placement of brackets ensures that the overall expression evaluates to `0`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 1 0`
  - `a = [0, 1, 1, 0]`
  - First `0` at index `0`, first `1` before `0` at index `1` (only one `1` before `0`).
  - Constructed expression: `(((0)->1)->(1->0))`
  - Output: `YES` and the constructed expression.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `a = [1, 1]`
  - No `0`, so condition fails.
  - Output: `NO`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 0`
  - `a = [0]`
  - Single `0`, no need for complex construction.
  - Output: `YES` and `0`.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly identifies whether it's possible to place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0` based on the given conditions and constructs the expression appropriately. The logic is sound and handles all cases as expected.

### Final Answer:

**Correctness: True**
