Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Implication is a function of two logical arguments, its value is false if and only if the value of the first argument is true and the value of the second argument is false. 

Implication is written by using character '$\rightarrow$', and the arguments and the result of the implication are written as '0' (false) and '1' (true). According to the definition of the implication: 

$0 \rightarrow 0 = 1$ 

$0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

$1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$ 

$1 \rightarrow 1 = 1$

When a logical expression contains multiple implications, then when there are no brackets, it will be calculated from left to fight. For example,

$0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 =(0 \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow 0 = 1 \rightarrow 0 = 0$. 

When there are brackets, we first calculate the expression in brackets. For example,

$0 \rightarrow(0 \rightarrow 0) = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 1$.

For the given logical expression $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow a_{3} \rightarrow \cdots \cdots a_{n}$ determine if it is possible to place there brackets so that the value of a logical expression is false. If it is possible, your task is to find such an arrangement of brackets.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of arguments in a logical expression.

The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($a_{i} \in \{0,1 \}$), which means the values of arguments in the expression in the order they occur.


-----Output-----

Print "NO" (without the quotes), if it is impossible to place brackets in the expression so that its value was equal to 0.

Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the logical expression with the required arrangement of brackets in the second line.

The expression should only contain characters '0', '1', '-' (character with ASCII code 45), '>' (character with ASCII code 62), '(' and ')'. Characters '-' and '>' can occur in an expression only paired like that: ("->") and represent implication. The total number of logical arguments (i.e. digits '0' and '1') in the expression must be equal to n. The order in which the digits follow in the expression from left to right must coincide with a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

The expression should be correct. More formally, a correct expression is determined as follows:  Expressions "0", "1" (without the quotes) are correct.  If v_1, v_2 are correct, then v_1->v_2 is a correct expression.  If v is a correct expression, then (v) is a correct expression. 

The total number of characters in the resulting expression mustn't exceed 10^6.

If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given Python loop and track the changes in the variables step by step.
        #
        #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
        #
        #The loop iterates over a range defined by `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index`. Specifically, it appends the binary value of elements in array `a` at each index between `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` (exclusive) to the `result` list.
        #
        #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
        #
        #- **Invariants:**
        #  - `n` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop or any modification within the loop.
        #  - `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified inside the loop.
        #  - `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` are not updated within the loop; hence, they remain constant.
        #
        #- **Variables affected by the loop:**
        #  - `i`: This variable changes with each iteration and is used to access elements in the array `a`.
        #
        #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
        #
        #The loop will execute as long as `first_one_index < first_zero_index`. For each iteration, it appends the binary value of `a[i]` followed by `'->'` to `result`.
        #
        #Given the provided outputs, we can infer the following:
        #- After the loop has executed, `i` takes the value of the last index processed, which is `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #- The loop stops when `i` reaches `first_zero_index - 1`.
        #
        #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
        #
        #From the outputs provided:
        #- After 1 execution: `i` becomes 2 (since `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` goes up to 2).
        #- After 2 executions: `i` becomes 3 (since `first_zero_index` is still 3, `i` goes up to 3).
        #- After 3 executions: `i` becomes 4 (since `first_zero_index` is 3, `i` would go up to 4 but stops).
        #
        #This indicates that the loop will stop when `i` equals `first_zero_index - 1`, which is 2 in the initial state. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly twice.
        #
        #### Final Output State
        #
        #Since the loop executes twice and appends the binary values of the specified indices in `a` to `result`, the final `result` list will contain the appended values for the indices between `first_one_index` and `first_zero_index` (inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end).
        #
        #Given the initial state:
        #- `a` = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
        #- `first_one_index` = 3
        #- `first_zero_index` = 0
        #
        #The indices to append are 3 and 4:
        #- `a[3]` is 0
        #- `a[4]` is 1
        #
        #Thus, the final `result` will be:
        #- `result` = ['0->', '1->', '0->', '1->']
        #
        #### Output State: `n` is 5, `a` is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], `first_one_index` is 3, `first_zero_index` is 0, `i` is 4, `result` is ['0->', '1->', '0->', '1->']
        result.append(str(a[first_zero_index]))

result.append(')')
        for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, n):
            result.append('->' + str(a[i]))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ### Analysis
        #
        ##### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
        #The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from `first_zero_index + 1` up to `n - 1`. Inside the loop, it appends a string to the `result` list by combining `'->'` and the value of `a[i]`.
        #
        ##### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
        #- **Invariant Variables**:
        #  - `n`: The length of the list `a`, which remains unchanged.
        #  - `first_zero_index`: Remains 0 because the loop only iterates over positions where `a[i]` is 1.
        #  - `first_one_index`: Remains 3 because it was initialized this way and the loop does not update it.
        #  - `a`: The list `a` itself does not change within the loop.
        #- **Variables that Change**:
        #  - `i`: Increases by 1 in each iteration.
        #  - `result`: Grows with each iteration by appending a new string.
        #
        ##### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
        #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
        #- Each iteration appends `a[i]` to `result` as a string prefixed by `'->'`.
        #- The loop stops when `i` reaches `n`.
        #
        ##### Step 4: Verify Relationships
        #- After the first iteration (`i` becomes 1), `result` becomes `['->0']`.
        #- After the second iteration (`i` becomes 2), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1']`.
        #- After the third iteration (`i` becomes 3), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1', '->0']`.
        #- After the fourth iteration (`i` becomes 4), `result` becomes `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1']`.
        #
        #Since `n` is 5 and the loop increments `i` until it equals `n`, the loop will execute 4 times in total.
        #
        #### Final Output State
        #- `n` remains 5.
        #- `first_zero_index` remains 0.
        #- `i` will be 4 after the last iteration.
        #- `first_one_index` remains 3.
        #- `a` remains `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
        #- `result` will contain `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']`.
        #
        #### Output State: 
        #n is 5, first_zero_index is 0, i is 4, first_one_index is 3, a is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], result is ['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']
        print(''.join(result))
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 5, `a` is a list of integers, and depending on the condition, either the following happens: 
    #- If 0 is in `a` and the number of 1s in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is greater than 0, the result is a list `['->0', '->1', '->0', '->1', '->0']` and a string `'->0->1->0->1->0'` is printed.
    #- If 0 is in `a` but the number of 1s in the sublist `a[:a.index(0)]` is not greater than 0, the same list `a` is maintained and no specific changes or prints are mentioned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. The function checks whether there is at least one 0 in the list `a` and ensures that there is at least one 1 before the first 0. If both conditions are met, it constructs a string based on the sequence of 1s and 0s in the list, and prints this string. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
