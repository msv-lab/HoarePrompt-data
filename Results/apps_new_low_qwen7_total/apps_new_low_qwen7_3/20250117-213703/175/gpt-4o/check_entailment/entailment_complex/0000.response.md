### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if it is possible to place brackets in the expression \(a_1 \rightarrow a_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow a_n\) such that the entire expression evaluates to `0`.
   - If it is possible, we need to construct an expression with brackets that achieves this.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The expression will evaluate to `0` only if there exists a segment in the sequence where the first part of the segment is `1`s and the next part is `0`.
   - Specifically, if there is a `0` at some position and there is at least one `1` before that `0`, we can place brackets to achieve the desired evaluation.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code first finds the index of the first `0` in the list `a`.
   - It then checks if there are any `1`s before the first `0`.
   - If there are `1`s before the first `0`, it constructs a valid expression with brackets to ensure the expression evaluates to `0`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there is at least one `1` before the first `0`.
   - If such a `1` exists, it constructs a valid expression by placing brackets appropriately.
   - If no such `1` exists, it prints `NO`, which is correct.

5. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - For the input `4 0 1 1 0`, the code correctly identifies that there is a `1` before the first `0` and constructs the expression `(((0)->1)->(1->0))` which evaluates to `0`.
   - For the input `2 1 1`, the code correctly identifies that no such segment exists and prints `NO`.

6. **Formal Proof:**
   - If there is a `0` at index `i` and there is at least one `1` before `i`, we can always place brackets to make the expression evaluate to `0`. For example, if `a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`, the expression `((1->1)->(0->1))->0` evaluates to `0`.
   - If no such `1` exists, the expression cannot be made to evaluate to `0`.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to place brackets in the expression such that it evaluates to `0` and constructs the appropriate expression if possible.

**Correctness:** **True**
