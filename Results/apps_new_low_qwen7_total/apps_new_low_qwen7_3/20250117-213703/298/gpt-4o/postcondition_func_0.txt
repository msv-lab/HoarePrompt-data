The function takes three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). It calculates \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \) and checks if \( \text{area} \) is an integer and non-zero. If \( \text{area} \) is an integer and non-zero, it prints 'YES'. If \( \text{area} \) is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. Depending on the value of \( 2 \times \text{area} \) relative to \( n \) and \( m \), it prints specific pairs of integers. If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( n \), it prints \( 2 \times \text{area} \) and 1. If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is greater than \( n \) but less than or equal to \( m \), it prints 1 and \( 2 \times \text{area} \). If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is greater than \( m \), it prints \( n \) and \( m // 2 \). The function also prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 \( m // 2 \)' at various points. After executing these steps, the function does not return any value but prints multiple lines of output based on the conditions specified.
