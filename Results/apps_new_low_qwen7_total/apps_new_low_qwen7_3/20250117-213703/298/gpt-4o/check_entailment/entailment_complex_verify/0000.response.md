Reasoning: Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input.

2. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).

3. **Integer Check**: The program checks if the calculated area is an integer using `area != int(area)`. This step is crucial because if the area is not an integer, no integer points can form a triangle with the exact area \(\frac{n \times m}{k}\). Therefore, if the area is not an integer, the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Area Non-Zero Check**: If the area is an integer and non-zero, the program prints "YES". This part is correct, but the subsequent steps need to ensure that the points chosen indeed form a triangle with the correct area.

5. **Point Generation**: The program attempts to generate points based on the conditions provided:
   - If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it prints \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), \((0, 1)\).
   - If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it prints \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), \((1, 0)\).
   - If \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), it prints \((n, m // 2)\), \((0, m // 2)\).

   These conditions are designed to form a triangle with the correct area. For instance, the area of the triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times \text{area} \times 1 = \text{area}\).

6. **Annotations and States**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, indicating that the program follows the logic as intended.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the case where the area is not an integer and prints "NO". For the cases where the area is an integer, the program attempts to find points that form a triangle with the correct area, which is logically sound.

Final: **True**
