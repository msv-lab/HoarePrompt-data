### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step, focusing on the logic and edge cases:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \). It checks if this area is an integer by comparing it with its integer value. If not, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to form a triangle with the given area.

3. **Handling Area as Integer**: If the area is an integer, the program proceeds to check if the area is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO" because a non-zero area is required.

4. **Triangle Formation**:
   - If the area is not zero, it prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find coordinates for the triangle:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it sets one vertex at \((0, 0)\), another at \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and the third at \((0, 1)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it sets one vertex at \((1, 0)\), another at \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).
     - Otherwise, it sets one vertex at \((n, m // 2)\), another at \((0, m // 2)\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).

### Analysis of Edge Cases and Correctness:

- **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The check for whether the area is an integer ensures that the area can indeed be formed by integer coordinates.
- **Zero Area Handling**: The check for zero area ensures that the triangle has a non-zero area.
- **Triangle Formation Logic**:
  - The logic for setting coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\) ensures that the base and height of the triangle are both integers.
  - However, there are some edge cases and potential issues with the current logic:
    - The coordinates \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) and \((0, 1)\) assume that \(2 \times \text{area}\) is always a valid x-coordinate, which might not be true if \(2 \times \text{area} > n\).
    - The coordinates \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\) and \((0, 0)\) assume that \(2 \times \text{area}\) is always a valid y-coordinate, which might not be true if \(2 \times \text{area} > m\).
    - The coordinates \((n, m // 2)\) and \((0, m // 2)\) might not always form a valid triangle if \(n < 2 \times \text{area}\) or \(m < 2 \times \text{area}\).

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Edge Case Analysis**:
  - If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), the program will incorrectly set coordinates that exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
  - For example, consider \(n = 10\), \(m = 5\), and \(k = 3\). The area would be \( \frac{10 \times 5}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67 \). Since this is not an integer, the program would print "NO".
  - However, if we consider \(n = 10\), \(m = 6\), and \(k = 3\), the area would be \( \frac{10 \times 6}{3} = 20 \), which is an integer. The program would incorrectly set coordinates \((20, 1)\) and \((0, 1)\), which are out of bounds.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the logic for forming the triangle will always work without considering the edge cases where \(2 \times \text{area}\) exceeds \(n\) or \(m\). The current implementation fails to handle these cases properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
