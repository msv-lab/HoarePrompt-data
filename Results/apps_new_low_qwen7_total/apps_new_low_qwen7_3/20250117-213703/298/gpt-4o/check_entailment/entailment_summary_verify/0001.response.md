### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \). It checks if this area is an integer by comparing it with its integer value. If not, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to form a triangle with the given area.

3. **Handling Area as Integer**: If the area is an integer, the program proceeds to check if the area is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO" because a non-zero area is required.

4. **Triangle Formation**:
   - If the area is not zero, it prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find coordinates for the triangle:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it sets one vertex at \((0, 0)\), another at \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and the third at \((0, 1)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it sets one vertex at \((1, 0)\), another at \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).
     - Otherwise, it sets one vertex at \((n, m // 2)\), another at \((0, m // 2)\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).

### Analysis of Edge Cases and Correctness:

- **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The check for whether the area is an integer ensures that the area can indeed be formed by integer coordinates.
- **Zero Area Handling**: The check for zero area ensures that the triangle has a non-zero area.
- **Triangle Formation Logic**:
  - The logic for setting coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\) ensures that the base and height of the triangle are both integers.
  - Similarly, the other conditions ensure that the coordinates are within the bounds \(0 \le x, y \le n, m\) respectively.

However, upon closer inspection, there is an issue with the coordinates chosen when \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \):

- In the last condition, the program sets one vertex at \((n, m // 2)\), another at \((0, m // 2)\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).
- The base of the triangle would be \( n \) and the height would be \( \frac{m}{2} \).
- The area of this triangle would be \( \frac{n \times \frac{m}{2}}{2} = \frac{nm}{4} \), which is not equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

Therefore, the chosen coordinates do not satisfy the requirement of forming a triangle with the exact area \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

### Conclusion:

Since the chosen coordinates in the last condition do not satisfy the requirement, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
