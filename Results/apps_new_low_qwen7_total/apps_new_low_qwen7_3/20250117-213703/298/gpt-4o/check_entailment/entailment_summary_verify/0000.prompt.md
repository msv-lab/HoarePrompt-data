You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program:
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')



- Function Summary: 
The function takes three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). It calculates \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \) and checks if \( \text{area} \) is an integer and non-zero. If \( \text{area} \) is an integer and non-zero, it prints 'YES'. If \( \text{area} \) is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. Depending on the value of \( 2 \times \text{area} \) relative to \( n \) and \( m \), it prints specific pairs of integers. If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( n \), it prints \( 2 \times \text{area} \) and 1. If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is greater than \( n \) but less than or equal to \( m \), it prints 1 and \( 2 \times \text{area} \). If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is greater than \( m \), it prints \( n \) and \( m // 2 \). The function also prints '0 0', '0 1', '1 0', and '0 \( m // 2 \)' at various points. After executing these steps, the function does not return any value but prints multiple lines of output based on the conditions specified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer but the program incorrectly prints "NO" without checking if the points can still form a valid triangle with the given area. For example, consider the input `4 4 5`. The area of the triangle should be \( \frac{4 \times 4}{5} = 3.2 \), which is not an integer. However, we can still find points that satisfy the condition. For instance, the points \((0, 0)\), \((4, 1)\), and \((1, 4)\) form a triangle with area \(3.2\).

The program should check if the area is an integer and then attempt to find points that satisfy the area condition. If the area is not an integer, the program should correctly identify that no such points exist.
