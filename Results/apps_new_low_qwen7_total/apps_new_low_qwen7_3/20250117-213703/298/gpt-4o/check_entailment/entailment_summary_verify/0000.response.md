Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program based on the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
- The area must be an integer, otherwise, it's impossible to form such a triangle with integer coordinates.
- If the area is an integer, we need to find specific points that satisfy the area condition.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function correctly calculates the area \(\text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k}\).
- It checks if \(\text{area}\) is an integer and non-zero.
- If \(\text{area}\) is not an integer, it prints "NO".
- If \(\text{area}\) is an integer and non-zero, it prints "YES" and tries to find specific points to form the triangle.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment claimed the program fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer but incorrectly prints "NO".
- However, the function correctly identifies when the area is not an integer and prints "NO". This means the program behaves correctly in such cases.
- The function correctly prints "NO" for inputs where the area is not an integer because it cannot form a triangle with integer coordinates that satisfies the area condition.

### Testing Specific Cases:
- Consider the example `4 4 5`: The area is \(3.2\), which is not an integer. The program correctly prints "NO".
- Consider the example `4 3 3`: The area is \(4\), which is an integer. The program finds and prints valid points \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((4, 1)\).

The provided function correctly handles all edge cases and the logic within the function aligns with the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly identifies when the area is not an integer and prints "NO". The function also correctly attempts to find points that satisfy the area condition when the area is an integer.

Final: **True**
