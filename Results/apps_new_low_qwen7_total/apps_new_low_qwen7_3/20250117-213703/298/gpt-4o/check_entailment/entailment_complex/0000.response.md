Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the area of the triangle is an integer. If the area is not an integer, it immediately prints 'NO'. This part is correct because the area must be an integer for the problem constraints to be met.

Next, it checks if the area is zero. If it is, it also prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the area is zero, it means \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \) and both \( n \) and \( m \) are zero, which is not possible within the given constraints (since \( n \) and \( m \) are at least 1).

After confirming that the area is a positive integer, the program then tries to find a set of coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) that satisfy the area condition and lie within the specified bounds. The logic for finding these coordinates is flawed:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program assumes that one of the coordinates must be \(2 \times \text{area}\), but this approach does not guarantee a valid triangle. For instance, if \(2 \times \text{area}\) is larger than \(n\) or \(m\), the coordinates chosen do not form a valid triangle.

2. **Lack of Triangle Formation Check**: The program does not check if the chosen points actually form a triangle with the required area. The given approach does not ensure that the points are distinct and form a non-degenerate triangle.

Given these issues, the program will produce incorrect outputs for many valid test cases. For example, if \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\), the correct output should include points like \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), \((4, 1)\) as shown in the example. However, the given program might fail to generate such points correctly.

Therefore, the overall logic and implementation of the solution are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
