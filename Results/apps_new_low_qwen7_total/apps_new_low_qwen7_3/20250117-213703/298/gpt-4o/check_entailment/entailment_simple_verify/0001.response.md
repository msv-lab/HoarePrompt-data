### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \). It checks if this area is an integer by comparing it with its integer value. If not, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to form a triangle with the given area.

3. **Handling Area as Integer**: If the area is an integer, the program proceeds to check if the area is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO" because a non-zero area is required.

4. **Triangle Formation**:
   - If the area is not zero, it prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find coordinates for the triangle:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it sets one vertex at \((0, 0)\), another at \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and the third at \((0, 1)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it sets one vertex at \((1, 0)\), another at \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).
     - Otherwise, it sets one vertex at \((n, m // 2)\), another at \((0, m // 2)\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).

### Analysis of Edge Cases and Correctness:

- **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The check for whether the area is an integer ensures that the area can indeed be formed by integer coordinates.
- **Zero Area Handling**: The check for zero area ensures that the triangle has a non-zero area.
- **Triangle Formation Logic**:
  - The logic for setting coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\) ensures that the base and height of the triangle are both integers. However, we need to verify if the area calculation and the chosen coordinates satisfy the condition \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \text{area}\).
  - For the condition \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), the base is \(2 \times \text{area}\) and the height is 1, which gives an area of \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times \text{area} \times 1 = \text{area}\).
  - For the condition \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), the base is 1 and the height is \(2 \times \text{area}\), which also gives an area of \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 \times \text{area} = \text{area}\).
  - For the condition \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), the coordinates \((n, m // 2)\) and \((0, m // 2)\) ensure that the height is \(m // 2\) and the base is \(n\), giving an area of \(\frac{1}{2} \times n \times m // 2 = \frac{nm}{4}\), which is not necessarily equal to \(\text{area} = \frac{nm}{k}\).

### Specific Issues:
- The chosen coordinates in the last condition do not guarantee that the area will be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For example, if \(k = 3\), the area would be \(\frac{nm}{3}\), but the coordinates provided only give \(\frac{nm}{4}\), which is incorrect.
- The program does not handle the case where \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is not an integer but \(2 \times \text{area}\) is still less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly form a triangle with the exact area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) in some scenarios, particularly when \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is not an integer but \(2 \times \text{area}\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is not correct for all possible inputs.
