You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program: 
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{nm}{k} \). It checks if this area is an integer by comparing it with its integer value. If not, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to form a triangle with the given area.

3. **Handling Area as Integer**: If the area is an integer, the program proceeds to check if the area is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO" because a non-zero area is required.

4. **Triangle Formation**:
   - If the area is not zero, it prints "YES".
   - The program then attempts to find coordinates for the triangle:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it sets one vertex at \((0, 0)\), another at \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and the third at \((0, 1)\).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it sets one vertex at \((1, 0)\), another at \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).
     - Otherwise, it sets one vertex at \((n, m // 2)\), another at \((0, m // 2)\), and the third at \((0, 0)\).

### Analysis of Edge Cases and Correctness:

- **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The check for whether the area is an integer ensures that the area can indeed be formed by integer coordinates.
- **Zero Area Handling**: The check for zero area ensures that the triangle has a non-zero area.
- **Triangle Formation Logic**:
  - The logic for setting coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\) ensures that the base and height of the triangle are both integers.
  - Similarly, the other conditions ensure that the coordinates are within the bounds \(0 \le x, y \le n, m\) respectively.

Given that the program handles all necessary checks and coordinate placements correctly, the solution is valid for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
