Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input.
2. It calculates the required area of the triangle as \(\text{area} = \frac{nm}{k}\).
3. It checks if the calculated area is an integer. If not, it prints 'NO', indicating that a triangle with the required area cannot be formed.
4. If the area is an integer, it further checks if the area is non-zero. If it is zero, it again prints 'NO'.
5. If the area is non-zero, it proceeds to check the feasibility of placing the points in such a way that the triangle's area matches the required value.
6. The logic inside the if-else block for checking the placement of points seems to ensure that the area condition is met using simple geometric principles (i.e., by positioning the points at appropriate coordinates to achieve the desired area).

However, the code provided does not fully address all the requirements:
- The code does not handle the case where the area might not be achievable with the constraints provided (e.g., when the area calculation results in a value that cannot be formed with the given dimensions \(n\) and \(m\)).
- The logic for placing the points to form the triangle with the exact area might be incomplete or incorrect, especially in edge cases.
- There is no explicit check to ensure that the points form a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., a triangle with a positive area).

Given the incomplete and potentially flawed logic within the if-else block for determining the points, we cannot guarantee that the program will always provide a correct solution or handle all edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
