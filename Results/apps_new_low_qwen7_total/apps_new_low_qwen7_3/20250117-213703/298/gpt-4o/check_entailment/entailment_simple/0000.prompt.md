Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')

                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, and 2 * `area` is either greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`, or less than or equal to `m`. In both cases, the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, no change occurs. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`, or less than or equal to `m`, then the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is 0, the function does not change the values of `area`, `n`, and `m`. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, no change occurs. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`, or less than or equal to `n`, the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is not an integer, the program prints 'NO'. If `area` is 0, the values of `area`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.
