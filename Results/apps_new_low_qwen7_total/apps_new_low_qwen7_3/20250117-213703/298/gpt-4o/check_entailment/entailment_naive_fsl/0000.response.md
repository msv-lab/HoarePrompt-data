Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer but the program incorrectly prints "NO" without checking if the points can still form a valid triangle with the given area. For example, consider the input `4 4 5`. The area of the triangle should be \( \frac{4 \times 4}{5} = 3.2 \), which is not an integer. However, we can still find points that satisfy the condition. For instance, the points \((0, 0)\), \((4, 1)\), and \((1, 4)\) form a triangle with area \(3.2\).

The program should check if the area is an integer and then attempt to find points that satisfy the area condition. If the area is not an integer, the program should correctly identify that no such points exist.
