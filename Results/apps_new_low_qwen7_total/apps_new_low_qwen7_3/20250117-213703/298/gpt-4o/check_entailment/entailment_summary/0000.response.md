Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it meets the requirements of the problem statement for all possible inputs. Specifically, we need to verify:

1. The program correctly determines if the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer.
2. If the area is an integer, it finds three points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
3. The program handles cases where the area is zero or non-integer appropriately.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Area Calculation and Integer Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the area as \(\text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k}\).
   - It then checks if this area is an integer using `area == int(area)`. This is a valid way to check if a float is an integer.

2. **Non-Zero Area Check:**
   - If the area is not an integer, it prints "NO", which is correct since a triangle cannot have a non-integer area.
   - If the area is zero, it also prints "NO", which is correct because a triangle with zero area means the points are collinear, and the problem specifies forming a triangle.

3. **Finding Points:**
   - If the area is a positive integer, the program prints "YES".
   - It then tries to find points based on the value of \(2 \times \text{area}\) relative to \(n\) and \(m\):
     - If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it uses points \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\).
     - If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it uses points \((1, 0)\), \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and \((0, 0)\).
     - If \(2 \times \text{area} > m\), it uses points \((n, m // 2)\), \((0, m // 2)\), and \((0, 0)\).

These steps cover all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement and ensure the program works for all valid inputs. Given the logical flow and the correctness of the conditions checked, the program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
