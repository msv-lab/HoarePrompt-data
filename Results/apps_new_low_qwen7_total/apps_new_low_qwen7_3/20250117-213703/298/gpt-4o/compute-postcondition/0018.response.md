Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is 0, the function does not change the values of `area`, `n`, and `m`. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, no change occurs. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`, or less than or equal to `n`, the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.***
