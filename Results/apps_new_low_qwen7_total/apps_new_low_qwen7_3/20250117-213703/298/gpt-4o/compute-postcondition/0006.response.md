The print statement 'NO' does not affect the values of the variables. It only outputs text to the console. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged. The value of `area` is still determined by the expression `(n * m) / k`, but since no new calculation is performed, its value remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is equal to the integer part of (n * m) / k, and the current value of `area` is 0**
