The initial state is that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). The code block reads:

```python
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
area = n * m / k
```

This block of code performs the following actions:

1. It takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It calculates the value of `area` as the product of `n` and `m` divided by `k`.

After executing these lines, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their input values, and a new variable `area` will be created with the calculated value. The value of `area` is the result of the division operation.

Therefore, the output state after running the provided code block will be:

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is a float equal to (n * m) / k**
