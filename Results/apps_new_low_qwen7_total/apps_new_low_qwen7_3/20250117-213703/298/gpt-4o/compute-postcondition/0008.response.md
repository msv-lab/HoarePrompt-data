Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is not equal to 0, print statements have been executed** 

Explanation: The code block consists of two print statements. The first line prints 'YES' to the console, and the second line prints '0 0' to the console. These operations do not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged. The only effect is the output of the two print statements.
