The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) do not apply directly to the function since no parameters are listed.

However, based on the given output cases, it seems there might be an implicit understanding that the function could use these parameters internally or be called with these parameters. Since the function itself does not accept parameters, we will focus on the provided output cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but based on internal processing or external calls, it handles integers n, m, and k with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 and returns either an integer or a string based on certain conditions.**
