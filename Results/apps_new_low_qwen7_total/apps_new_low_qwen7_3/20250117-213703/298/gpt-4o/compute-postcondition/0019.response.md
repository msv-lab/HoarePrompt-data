Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers. If `area` is not an integer, the program prints 'NO'. If `area` is 0, the values of `area`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.***
