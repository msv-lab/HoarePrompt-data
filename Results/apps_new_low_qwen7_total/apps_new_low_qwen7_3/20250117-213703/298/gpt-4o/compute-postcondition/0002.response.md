The code prints 'NO', but this does not affect the values of the variables. The only change is that the program outputs 'NO'. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and keeps the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is a float equal to (n * m) / k, and the program prints 'NO'.**
