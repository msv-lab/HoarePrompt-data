The given code consists of two print statements:

1. `print(f'1 {2 * area}')`: This prints the string `1` followed by the value of `2 * area`.
2. `print(f'1 0')`: This prints the string `1` followed by `0`.

From the initial state, we know that `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`. The code does not modify any of the variables; it only prints their values. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is not equal to 0, 2 * area is greater than n and less than or equal to m**
