Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are integers, and `area` is not equal to 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, no change occurs. If `2 * area` is greater than `n` and less than or equal to `m`, or less than or equal to `m`, then the relationship between `area`, `n`, and `m` remains as specified.***
