`area` is initially a float equal to \((n * m) / k\), and it is also equal to an integer. The code snippet changes `area` to be an integer by converting it using `int(area)`. Therefore, `area` now holds the integer part of its previous float value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is equal to the integer part of \((n * m) / k\)**
