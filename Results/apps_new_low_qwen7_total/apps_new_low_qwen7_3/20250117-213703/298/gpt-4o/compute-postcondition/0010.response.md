The first line of the code block prints the string `'2 * area 1'`. This does not change any variable values but prints the value of `2 * area` followed by the number `1`.

The second line of the code block prints the string `'0 1'`. Similar to the first line, this also does not change any variable values but prints `0` followed by the number `1`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, these print statements do not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is not equal to 0, and 2 * area is less than or equal to n**
