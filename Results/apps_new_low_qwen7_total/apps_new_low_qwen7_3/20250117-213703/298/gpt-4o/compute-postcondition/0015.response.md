The first line of the code block prints the values of `n` and `m // 2`. Since `m` is an integer, `m // 2` will be the integer division of `m` by 2. The second line of the code block prints `0` followed by `m // 2`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, none of these variables are affected by the code block.

The output state remains unchanged by the code block. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, area is not equal to 0, and 2 * area is less than or equal to m**
