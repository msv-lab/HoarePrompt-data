Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b` as the first element of a tuple, and `0` as the second element. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the Euclidean algorithm correctly computes the GCD for any pair of non-negative integers (including zero). However, the function does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is negative, although the problem statement specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function also does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is zero, although the annotations suggest that both `a` and `b` are initially positive integers.**
