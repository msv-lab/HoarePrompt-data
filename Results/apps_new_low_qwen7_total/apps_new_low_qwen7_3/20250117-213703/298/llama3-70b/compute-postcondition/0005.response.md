The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(b > 0\). The function returns either 1 and 0 if `a` is a non-negative integer and `b` is 0, or it returns `y` and `x - a // b * y` where `x` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[0]` and `y` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[1]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with \(b > 0\)), and return either 1 and 0 if `b` is 0, or compute and return specific values based on the Euclidean algorithm for the greatest common divisor.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers with \(b > 0\), and returns either 1 and 0 if `b` is 0, or returns `y` and `x - a // b * y` where `x` and `y` are results from calling `func_2(b, a % b)`.**
