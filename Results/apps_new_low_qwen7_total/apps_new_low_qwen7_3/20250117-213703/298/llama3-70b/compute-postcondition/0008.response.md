The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers representing dimensions, and there is an additional constraint that k is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\), although k itself is not a parameter of the function.

Based on the output description, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and the second element is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, compute the GCD of `a` and `b`, and return a tuple containing the GCD of `a` and `b` as the first element and 0 as the second element.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns a tuple where the first element is the GCD of `a` and `b`, and the second element is 0.**
