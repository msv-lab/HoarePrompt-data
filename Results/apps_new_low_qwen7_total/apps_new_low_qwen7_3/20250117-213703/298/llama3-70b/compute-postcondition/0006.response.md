Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where \(b > 0\). If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with arguments `b` and `a % b`, storing the results as `x` and `y`. It then returns `(y, x - a // b * y)`. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = \gcd(a, b)`, where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, the function should ideally raise an error since both inputs cannot be zero. However, the given code does not handle this case and returns `(1, 0)`.
- If `a` is 0 and `b` is a positive integer, the function correctly returns `(0, 1)`, as \(\gcd(0, b) = b\) and \(0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot b = b\).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly check for invalid inputs (e.g., if `a` or `b` are negative). While the initial condition ensures \(b > 0\), no check is performed for `a < 0`.
