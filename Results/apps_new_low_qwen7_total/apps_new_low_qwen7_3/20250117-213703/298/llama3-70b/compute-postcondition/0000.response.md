The code snippet `x, y = func_2(a, b)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `a` and `b`, and assigns the return values to `x` and `y`. However, since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. We know that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). The function call does not affect the value of `k`, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\); `x` is the return value from `func_2(a, b)`, and `y` is the second return value from `func_2(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\); `x` is the return value from `func_2(a, b)`, and `y` is the second return value from `func_2(a, b)`**.
