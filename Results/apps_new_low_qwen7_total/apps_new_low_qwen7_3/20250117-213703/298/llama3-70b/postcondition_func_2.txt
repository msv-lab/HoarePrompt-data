The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values `x` and `y`. Finally, it returns these values along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the outputs of `func_2(a, b)` to produce its result.
