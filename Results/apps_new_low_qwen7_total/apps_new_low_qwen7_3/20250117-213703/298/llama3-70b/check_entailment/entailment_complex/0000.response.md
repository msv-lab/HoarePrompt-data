### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the rectangle defined by \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For the area of the triangle to be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), the area of the rectangle \(\frac{nm}{2}\) must be divisible by \(\frac{nm}{k}\), implying that \(k\) must divide 2. Since \(k \geq 2\), this condition is satisfied.
   - One possible configuration to form the triangle with the required area is to use points at the corners of the rectangle adjusted by multiples of \(\frac{n}{g}\) and \(\frac{m}{g}\), where \(g = \text{gcd}(n, m)\).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - **func_2**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not directly used in solving the problem but ensures correctness of the GCD computation.
   - **func_3**: Uses the GCD computed by `func_1` to ensure the points can form the required area.

4. **Program Flow**:
   - Checks if \(nm \mod k = 0\). If not, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - Computes the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_3`.
   - If the product of \(n1 \times m1\) (where \(n1\) and \(m1\) are the scaled dimensions) is greater than or equal to the GCD, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the points.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\).
   - It correctly computes the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic for determining if the points can form the required area is sound.
   - The output format and conditions are correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
