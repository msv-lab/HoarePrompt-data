Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code consists of three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that deal with mathematical operations but do not attempt to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the code does not include any logic to achieve this.

Given the problem description, a correct solution would need to involve setting up the coordinates of the points in a way that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The provided code does not include any such logic or even attempt to calculate the area of a triangle or handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, since the provided code does not implement the required functionality and does not attempt to solve the given problem, it is incorrect.
