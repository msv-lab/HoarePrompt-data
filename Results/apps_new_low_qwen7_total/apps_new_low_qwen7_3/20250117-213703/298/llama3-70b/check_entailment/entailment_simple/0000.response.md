### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Check:**
   - The program correctly reads the inputs \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) and checks if the product \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). This is necessary because for a triangle to have an area of \(\frac{nm}{k}\), this condition must hold true.
   - If the product \(nm\) is not divisible by \(k\), the program prints "NO" and exits. This is correct because if \(nm\) is not divisible by \(k\), it's impossible to form a triangle with the required area.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function works correctly and returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The function `func_2(a, b)` uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). This function is correct and returns the values \(x\) and \(y\).

4. **Forming the Triangle:**
   - The function `func_3(a, b)` uses the results from `func_2(a, b)` to compute \(x\) and \(y\) and also computes \(z = x \cdot a + y \cdot b\). This function is also correct.
   - After determining \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), the program checks if \(n1 * m \geq g\). Here, \(n1\) and \(m1\) are likely the values returned by `func_3(n, m)`, and \(g\) is their third component. The check ensures that the values are valid for forming a triangle with the required area.
   - If the condition \(n1 * m \geq g\) holds, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\). These points indeed form a triangle with the required area because the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{1}{2} \times n1 \times m1 \times m \times n = \frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Output Handling:**
   - If the condition \(n1 * m < g\) fails, the program prints "NO". This is correct because in that case, it is not possible to form a triangle with the required area using the given dimensions.

Given all these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to find the required points or determine that no such points exist.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
