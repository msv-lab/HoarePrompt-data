Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - We need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) such that the area of the triangle they form is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle formed by points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula: \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code checks if \(nm \mod k = 0\). If this condition is not met, it prints "NO" and exits, which is correct because the area of the triangle must be an integer.
   - The code then calls `func_3(n, m)` which seems to involve finding some integer combination using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - Based on the hints, `func_3` is likely intended to find integers \(x_1, y_1\) such that \(nx_1 + my_1 = \gcd(n, m)\).
   - If the area condition is satisfied, it prints "YES" and calculates specific points based on the gcd values and the area requirement.
   - The logic for calculating the points seems to follow the conditions for forming a triangle with the required area.

3. **Verification**:
   - The approach to check the divisibility condition \(nm \mod k = 0\) is correct.
   - The usage of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and the calculation of the points appear to be designed to meet the area requirement.
   - Given the problem constraints and the provided function hints, the code appears to follow the necessary steps to find valid points or determine that no solution exists.

Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly follows the problem requirements and the provided functions seem to implement the necessary calculations. Therefore, the program is correct.
