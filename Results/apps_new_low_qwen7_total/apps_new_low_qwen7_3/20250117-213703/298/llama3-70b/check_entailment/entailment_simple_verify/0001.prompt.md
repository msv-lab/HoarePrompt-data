You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, and b, which is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(b > 0\), and they represent the coordinates of one of the points to be used in forming the triangle with the required area.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is 0, and the program returns 1, 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`y` and `x - a // b * y` where `x` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[0]` and `y` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[1]`

#Function 3:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find three integer points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). This implies that the area of the triangle must be an integer, which means \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\).

2. **GCD and Bezout's Identity**: The functions provided (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) are related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and using Bezout's identity to find integer solutions for equations involving GCD.

3. **Checking Divisibility**: Before attempting to find the points, we need to check if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it's impossible to form a triangle with the required area, and we should output "NO".

4. **Finding Points**: If \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\), we need to ensure that the points form a triangle with the correct area. One straightforward way to achieve this is to place the points at the corners of a rectangle with dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) and adjust the third point to meet the area requirement. Specifically, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle formed by points \((0,0)\), \((n,0)\), and \((0,m)\) is \(\frac{nm}{2}\). By scaling this down, we can ensure the area is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Verification**: The provided functions seem to handle GCD and related calculations but do not directly address the problem of finding the points. However, since the problem's solution involves basic arithmetic and does not require advanced number theory techniques beyond checking divisibility and simple coordinate adjustments, the provided functions might be overkill for this specific task.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic seems correct in terms of its approach to solving the problem, although the use of those functions might be unnecessary for a simpler direct solution.

Correctness: **True**

However, the provided solution could be simplified. Here is a simplified version of the solution:

```python
import math

def solve(n, m, k):
    # Check if nm is divisible by k
    if (n * m) % k != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate the required area
    required_area = n * m // k
    
    # Points forming the triangle
    x1, y1 = 0, 0
    x2, y2 = n, 0
    x3, y3 = 0, m - (required_area * 2 // n)
    
    return "YES\n{} {}\n{} {}\n{} {}".format(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)

# Example usage
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(solve(n, m, k))
```

This simplified version directly checks the divisibility and calculates the coordinates of the points to form the required triangle area.
