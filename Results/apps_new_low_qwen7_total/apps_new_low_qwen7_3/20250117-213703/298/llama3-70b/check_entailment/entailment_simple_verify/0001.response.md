### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For the area to be an integer, \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\). If not, the answer is "NO".

2. **Initial Assessment Analysis**:
   - The initial assessment correctly identifies that \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\) before proceeding.
   - It also mentions the use of GCD and related functions, but these functions are overkill for the specific problem.
   - The simplified solution provided in the original assessment is correct and straightforward.
   - The initial assessment suggests the provided functions might be overkill, which is accurate.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)\).
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Combines the results from `func_2` to find integer solutions for the equation \(ax + by = c\).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\).
   - If divisible, it uses the coordinates of a rectangle and adjusts one point to meet the area requirement.
   - The adjusted point calculation seems correct, ensuring the area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Simplified Solution**:
   - The simplified solution provided in the original assessment is more direct and easier to understand.
   - It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly calculating the required area and adjusting the coordinates accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. While the provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are not necessary for this specific problem, the logic in the program is correct. The program correctly handles the divisibility check and computes the coordinates to form the required triangle area.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
