### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to verify if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   ```python
   (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   This line reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Check if Area is Possible:**
   ```python
   if n * m % k:
       print('NO')
       exit()
   ```
   This checks if the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, indicating that no such points exist.

3. **Calculate Coordinates Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
   ```python
   (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
   ```
   Here, `func_3` is called to get the coordinates. The function `func_3` uses `func_2`, which implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, to find integers `x` and `y` such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). For our case, `n1` and `m1` are derived using this algorithm.

4. **Form the Triangle:**
   ```python
   if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
       print('YES')
       print(0, 0)
       print(0, n1 * m // g)
       print(m1 * m // g, 0)
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   - The condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` checks if the calculated values satisfy the requirement for forming the triangle.
   - If true, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the points.
   - If false, it prints "NO".

5. **Function Definitions:**
   - **`func_1`**: Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **`func_2`**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find `x` and `y` such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - **`func_3`**: Uses the results from `func_2` to form the required linear combination.

The code logic ensures that the points are chosen such that the area of the triangle formed is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Specifically, the coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) are calculated to ensure the area condition is met.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the code does not solve the problem. However, upon reviewing the code and its implementation, we can see that it correctly uses mathematical properties to determine the existence of such points and calculates the necessary coordinates to form the triangle with the required area.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it follows the problem requirements and uses appropriate mathematical methods to find the points.
