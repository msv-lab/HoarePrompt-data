### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find three integer points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). This implies that the area of the triangle must be an integer, which means \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\).

2. **GCD and Bezout's Identity**: The functions provided (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) are related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and using Bezout's identity to find integer solutions for equations involving GCD. However, these functions are not directly used to solve the problem at hand.

3. **Checking Divisibility**: Before attempting to find the points, we need to check if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it's impossible to form a triangle with the required area, and we should output "NO".

4. **Finding Points**: If \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\), we need to ensure that the points form a triangle with the correct area. One straightforward way to achieve this is to place the points at the corners of a rectangle with dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) and adjust the third point to meet the area requirement. Specifically, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle formed by points \((0,0)\), \((n,0)\), and \((0,m)\) is \(\frac{nm}{2}\). By scaling this down, we can ensure the area is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Verification**: The provided functions seem to handle GCD and related calculations but do not directly address the problem of finding the points. However, since the problem's solution involves basic arithmetic and does not require advanced number theory techniques beyond checking divisibility and simple coordinate adjustments, the provided functions might be overkill for this specific task.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\).
   - If \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\), it attempts to find the points.
   - The function `func_3` is used to find some integers that satisfy a linear Diophantine equation, but it is not clear how these integers are directly used to form the required triangle area.

7. **Simplified Solution**: A simpler and more direct solution can be derived without using the complex functions provided. The simplified solution provided in the original assessment directly checks divisibility and calculates the coordinates of the points to form the required triangle area.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic is fundamentally sound and correctly addresses the problem. However, the use of the provided functions is unnecessary and might introduce complexity without providing any additional value.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct in its approach to solving the problem, although the use of the provided functions is not necessary and might be overkill for the task at hand. The simplified solution provided in the original assessment correctly handles the problem with minimal complexity.
