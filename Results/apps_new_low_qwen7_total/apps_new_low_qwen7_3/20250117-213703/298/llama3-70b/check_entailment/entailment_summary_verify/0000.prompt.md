You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values `x` and `y`. Finally, it returns these values along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the outputs of `func_2(a, b)` to produce its result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code consists of three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that deal with mathematical operations but do not attempt to solve the problem described. The problem requires finding three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the code does not include any logic to achieve this.

Given the problem description, a correct solution would need to involve setting up the coordinates of the points in a way that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The provided code does not include any such logic or even attempt to calculate the area of a triangle or handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, since the provided code does not implement the required functionality and does not attempt to solve the given problem, it is incorrect.
