### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - We need to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The area of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the determinant formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code consists of three helper functions:
     - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
     - `func_2` implements the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the BÃ©zout coefficients.
     - `func_3` uses the results from `func_2` to compute a linear combination of the input numbers.

3. **Function Summaries**:
   - These functions do not directly relate to solving the problem. They perform mathematical operations but do not address the requirement to find points that form a triangle of the specified area.

4. **Solution Requirement**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine how to place the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area condition is satisfied.
   - One possible approach is to use the fact that the area of a triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((n, 0)\), and \((0, m)\) is \(\frac{nm}{2}\). By scaling and shifting these points, we can achieve the desired area \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the provided code does not attempt to solve the problem and is therefore incorrect. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are not relevant to the problem and do not contribute to solving it.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. Since the provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem, the assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
