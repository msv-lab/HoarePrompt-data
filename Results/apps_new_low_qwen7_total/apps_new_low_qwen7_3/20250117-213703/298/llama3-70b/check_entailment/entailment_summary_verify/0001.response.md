### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The area of a triangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((n,0)\), and \((0,m)\) is \(\frac{nm}{2}\). To achieve an area of \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we can scale down the dimensions appropriately.

2. **Initial Assessment Breakdown**:
   - **Divisibility Check**: The original assessment correctly identifies that \(nm\) must be divisible by \(k\).
   - **Finding Points**: The assessment suggests placing points at the corners of a rectangle and adjusting the third point to meet the area requirement.
   - **Function Usage**: The assessment notes that the provided functions might be overkill but does not delve into why they are necessary or how they contribute to the solution.

3. **Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1`: Computes the GCD of two numbers.
   - `func_2`: Implements the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients for the linear combination of the GCD.
   - `func_3`: Uses the results from `func_2` to compute the linear combination of the GCD.

4. **Simplified Solution Analysis**:
   - The simplified solution provided directly checks divisibility and calculates the coordinates of the points.
   - While the original assessment did not explicitly mention the necessity of the provided functions, it implied that they might be overkill for a simpler direct solution.

5. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - The simplified solution works as intended and is logically sound.
   - The provided functions, though not used in the simplified solution, are still correct and can be used to find the coefficients needed for the linear combination. However, for this specific problem, they are not strictly necessary.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is largely accurate but could have been more explicit about the necessity of the provided functions. The simplified solution is a valid and efficient approach to the problem.

**Final Evaluation: True**

The given program is correct and the original assessment was accurate in identifying the key steps and logical flow, even if it could have provided more detail on the use of the provided functions.
