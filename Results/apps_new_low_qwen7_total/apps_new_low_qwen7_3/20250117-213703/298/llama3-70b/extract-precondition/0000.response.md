Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and k is a positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^9.** 

Explanation: The function `func_3` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a triplet `(x, y, z)` where `(x, y)` is returned from another function `func_2`, and `z` is calculated as `x * a + y * b`. Given the problem context, `a` and `b` are derived from `n` and `m`, and `k` is derived from the problem constraints. However, the exact relationship between `a`, `b`, and the original `n`, `m`, `k` is not directly provided in the function signature. Thus, we infer that `a` and `b` are related to `n` and `m` in some manner, and `k` is a parameter affecting the area condition, making the precondition as stated.
