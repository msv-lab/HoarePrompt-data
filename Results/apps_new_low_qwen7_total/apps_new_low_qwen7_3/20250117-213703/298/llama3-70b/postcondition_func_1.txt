The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where \(b > 0\). If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with arguments `b` and `a % b`, storing the results as `x` and `y`. It then returns `(y, x - a // b * y)`. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = \gcd(a, b)`, where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
