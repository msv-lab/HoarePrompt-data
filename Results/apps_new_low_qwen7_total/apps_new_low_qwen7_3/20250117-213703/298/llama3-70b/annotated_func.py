#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers, and they are the dimensions n and m (or m and n) from the input, respectively, and k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is the GCD of the initial values of a and b; b is 0; k is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, and b, which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b` as the first element of a tuple, and `0` as the second element. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the Euclidean algorithm correctly computes the GCD for any pair of non-negative integers (including zero). However, the function does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is negative, although the problem statement specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function also does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is zero, although the annotations suggest that both `a` and `b` are initially positive integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(b > 0\), and they represent the coordinates of one of the points to be used in forming the triangle with the required area.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is 0, and the program returns 1, 0
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #`y` and `x - a // b * y` where `x` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[0]` and `y` is the result of `func_2(b, a % b)[1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where \(b > 0\). If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with arguments `b` and `a % b`, storing the results as `x` and `y`. It then returns `(y, x - a // b * y)`. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = \gcd(a, b)`, where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and k is a positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x, y, and (x * a + y * b), where x and y are the return values from func_2(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values `x` and `y`. Finally, it returns these values along with their linear combination `x * a + y * b`. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the outputs of `func_2(a, b)` to produce its result.
