Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a string is "s-palindrome" by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases within the given constraints. The function `func_1` iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string. If all characters match, the function returns `True`, indicating the string is "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is deemed correct.
