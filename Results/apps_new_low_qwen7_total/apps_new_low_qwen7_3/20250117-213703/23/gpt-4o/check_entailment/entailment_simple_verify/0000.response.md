### Reasoning:

The provided program and the function `func_1` indeed check if the given string `s` is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. However, the problem description specifically asks for a string to be "s-palindrome," which requires symmetry around the middle of the string. In other words, the string should read the same from both ends towards the center.

The function `func_1` checks for symmetry by iterating over the first half of the string and comparing it with the second half. This approach is correct for determining if the string is a palindrome, but it does not account for the specific requirement of "s-palindrome" as described in the problem.

The provided examples in the problem description do not fully illustrate the distinction between a standard palindrome and an "s-palindrome." For instance:
- "oXoxoXo" is a palindrome but not necessarily an "s-palindrome" unless the symmetry around the middle is explicitly checked.
- "bod" and "ER" are also palindromes but again, they need to be checked for "s-palindrome" symmetry.

Given that the function `func_1` checks for palindrome properties rather than "s-palindrome" properties, it does not satisfy the specific requirement outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program will incorrectly identify some strings as "s-palindrome" when they are not.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not verify the "s-palindrome" property as defined in the problem description. It instead verifies if the string is a palindrome, which is a different concept.
