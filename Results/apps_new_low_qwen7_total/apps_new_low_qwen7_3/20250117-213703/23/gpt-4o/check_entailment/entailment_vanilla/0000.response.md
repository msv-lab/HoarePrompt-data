Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly checks if the given string `s` is an "s-palindrome."
- The function `func_1` is responsible for determining if the string is symmetric about its middle.
- It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string.
- If any characters do not match, it returns `False`, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome."
- If all corresponding characters match, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome."
- The main part of the program calls `func_1` and prints 'TAK' if the function returns `True`, and 'NIE' if it returns `False`.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
