Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

# Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It checks whether `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. The function covers all edge cases where the string length is odd or even. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-English letters, these cases are implicitly handled since the function expects `s` to consist of only English letters and have a length within the specified range.
