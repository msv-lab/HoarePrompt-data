Reasoning:
1. The problem defines an "s-palindrome" as a string that is symmetric about its middle, which means it should read the same forwards and backwards.
2. The provided program uses a function `func_1` to check if the given string `s` is a palindrome.
3. The function `func_1` iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string. This correctly checks for symmetry.
4. The program calls `func_1` with the input string and prints 'TAK' if it returns `True`, and 'NIE' if it returns `False`.
5. The provided execution summary correctly describes how `func_1` works and states that it handles all relevant edge cases for the given constraints.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
