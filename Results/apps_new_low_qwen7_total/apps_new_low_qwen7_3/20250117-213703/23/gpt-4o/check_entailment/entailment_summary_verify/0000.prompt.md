You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

- Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It checks whether `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. The function covers all edge cases where the string length is odd or even. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-English letters, these cases are implicitly handled since the function expects `s` to consist of only English letters and have a length within the specified range.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a string is "s-palindrome" by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases within the given constraints. The function `func_1` iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string. If all characters match, the function returns `True`, indicating the string is "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is deemed correct.
