### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and the end moving towards the center.
   - It iterates over the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character from the end of the string.
   - If any pair of characters does not match, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If all pairs match, the function returns `True`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_1(s)` with the input string `s`.
   - If `func_1(s)` returns `True`, it prints 'TAK'.
   - If `func_1(s)` returns `False`, it prints 'NIE'.

3. **Problem Definition**:
   - A string is considered an "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. This means that the first half of the string is a mirror reflection of the second half.

4. **Analyze `func_1(s)` Implementation**:
   - The function correctly checks for the symmetry by comparing characters from both ends of the string.
   - If the string is symmetric, it will return `True`.
   - If the string is not symmetric, it will return `False`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles strings of even and odd lengths.
   - For even-length strings, the loop runs up to `n // 2 - 1` (where `n` is the length of the string), ensuring that the comparison covers the entire string symmetrically.
   - For odd-length strings, the loop runs up to `n // 2 - 1`, effectively ignoring the middle character since it is not part of the mirrored pair.

Given that the function `func_1(s)` correctly implements the logic to check if a string is a palindrome and the main program correctly uses this function to determine if the string is an "s-palindrome," the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
