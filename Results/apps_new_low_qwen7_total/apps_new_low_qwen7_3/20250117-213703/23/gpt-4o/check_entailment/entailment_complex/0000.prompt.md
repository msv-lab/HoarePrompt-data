Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE

# Annotated Program:
s = input().strip()
if func_1(s):
    print('TAK')
else:
    print('NIE')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of `s` (with `n` being at least 2). After the loop finishes, the condition `s[i] == s[n - 1 - i]` holds for all `i` in the range `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, then the string `s` is a palindrome.
    return True
    #The program returns True indicating that string 's' is a palindrome
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It checks whether `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. The function covers all edge cases where the string length is odd or even. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-English letters, these cases are implicitly handled since the function expects `s` to consist of only English letters and have a length within the specified range.
