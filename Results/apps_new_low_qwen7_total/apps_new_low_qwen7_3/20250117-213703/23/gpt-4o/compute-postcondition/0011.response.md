Output State: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of `s` (with `n` being at least 2). After the loop finishes, the condition `s[i] == s[n - 1 - i]` holds for all `i` in the range `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, then the string `s` is a palindrome.
