Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2; `i` is 1; if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific change is mentioned, so we retain the original condition where `s[1]` equals `s[n - 2]`.***
