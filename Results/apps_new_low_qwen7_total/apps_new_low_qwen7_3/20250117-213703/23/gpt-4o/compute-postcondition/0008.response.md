Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n // 2)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n // 2 - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < n // 2` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of `s`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2; `i` is 2**.
