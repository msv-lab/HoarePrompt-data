Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of `s` (with `n` at least 2); `i` is 2. If the character at position `i` (`s[2]`) is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - i` (`s[1]`), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains unchanged as no specific return value is mentioned in the else part).***
