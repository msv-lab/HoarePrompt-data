Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.
3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and the loop condition is `i < n // 2`, the loop will execute again if `n // 2 > 0`, which is always true given that `n >= 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `s[i] == s[n - 1 - i]` must still hold true, i.e., `s[1] == s[n - 2]`.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` increases by 1, so it becomes 1.
   - `s[i]` (which is `s[1]`) must still be equal to `s[n - 1 - i]` (which is `s[n - 2]`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2; `i` is 1; `s[1]` is equal to `s[n - 2]`**
