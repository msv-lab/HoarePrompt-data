The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function returns False in three cases and returns True if the string `s` is a palindrome.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `False` unless `s` is a palindrome, in which case it returns `True`.
