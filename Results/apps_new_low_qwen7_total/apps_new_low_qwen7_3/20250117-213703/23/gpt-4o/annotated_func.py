#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of `s` (with `n` being at least 2). After the loop finishes, the condition `s[i] == s[n - 1 - i]` holds for all `i` in the range `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, then the string `s` is a palindrome.
    return True
    #The program returns True indicating that string 's' is a palindrome
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It checks whether `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. The function covers all edge cases where the string length is odd or even. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-English letters, these cases are implicitly handled since the function expects `s` to consist of only English letters and have a length within the specified range.
