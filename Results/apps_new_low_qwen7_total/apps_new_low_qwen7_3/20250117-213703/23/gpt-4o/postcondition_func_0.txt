The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of only English letters and its length is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It checks whether `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. The function covers all edge cases where the string length is odd or even. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-English letters, these cases are implicitly handled since the function expects `s` to consist of only English letters and have a length within the specified range.
