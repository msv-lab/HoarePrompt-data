You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

- Program:
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes three non-negative integer values `l`, `r`, and `a` (where \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\)) obtained from user input. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, then `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, then `r` is adjusted to `r + min(a, l - r)`, and `a` is updated accordingly. In both cases, `a` is reduced by the minimum amount used for adjustment.

After adjusting `l` and `r`, the function calculates the maximum possible team size (`max_team_size`) as `l + r + a // 2 * 2`. If this calculated value is odd, `max_team_size` is decremented by 1 to ensure it is even. Finally, the function prints the computed `max_team_size`.

Potential edge cases include when `a` is zero or when `l` equals `r`. If `a` is zero, the adjustments to `l` and `r` will not occur, and the final `max_team_size` will simply be the sum of `l`, `r`, and any remaining `a` (which will be zero). When `l` equals `r`, the adjustments will be made based on the value of `a`, and the final `max_team_size` will be adjusted accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `a` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Balancing Left-Handers and Right-Handers**:
   - If there are more right-handers than left-handers (`r > l`), it attempts to balance by taking the minimum of `a` and `r - l` ambidexters to play with their left hand.
   - Similarly, if there are more left-handers than right-handers (`l > r`), it balances by taking the minimum of `a` and `l - r` ambidexters to play with their right hand.

3. **Calculating Maximum Team Size**:
   - After balancing, the program calculates the maximum team size as the sum of `l`, `r`, and `a // 2 * 2`. This accounts for the fact that each ambidexter can contribute to either side, but we need to ensure the team size is even.
   - If the calculated team size is odd, it subtracts 1 to make it even.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final team size, which is the maximum even number of players that can be formed with the given constraints.

Given these points, the logic appears to handle the constraints correctly and produce the expected results as per the problem statement.
