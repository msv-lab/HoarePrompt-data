Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The program starts with the values of `l`, `r`, and `a` being non-negative integers (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100).

2. **First if-else Block**:
   - If `l < r`, the code increments `l` by the minimum of `a` and `r - l` and sets `a` to 0.
   - If `r < l`, the code increments `r` by the minimum of `a` and `l - r` and sets `a` to 0.
   
   This ensures that we balance `l` and `r` by using the ambidexters optimally to make the difference between `l` and `r` as small as possible.

3. **Calculating Maximum Team Size**:
   - After ensuring `l` and `r` are balanced, the program calculates `max_team_size` as `l + r + a // 2 * 2`.
   - This formula accounts for the total number of players (left-handers + right-handers + ambidexters playing either hand) and ensures it's even by dividing `a` by 2 and multiplying back by 2.

4. **Adjusting for Odd Values**:
   - If `max_team_size` is odd, it subtracts 1 to make it even, ensuring the final result is always even.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `max_team_size` is printed, which is the maximum even number of players that can be formed with equal numbers of left-handers and right-handers.

Given this logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
