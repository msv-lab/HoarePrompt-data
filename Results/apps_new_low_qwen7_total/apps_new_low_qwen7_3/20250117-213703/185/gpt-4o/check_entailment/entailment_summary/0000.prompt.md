Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are at a water bowling training. There are l people who play with their left hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who can play with left or right hand.

The coach decided to form a team of even number of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right hand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One player should use only on of his hands.

Ambidexters play as well with their right hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with their left hand, or with their right hand.

Please find the maximum possible size of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right hands, respectively.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0 ≤ l, r, a ≤ 100) — the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and the number of ambidexters at the training. 


-----Output-----

Print a single even integer — the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can only have zero number of players.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 4 2

Output
6

Input
5 5 5

Output
14

Input
0 2 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example you can form a team of 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play with left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only person left can't be taken into the team.

In the second example you can form a team of 14 people. You have to take all five left-handers, all five right-handers, two ambidexters to play with left hand and two ambidexters to play with right hand.

# Program:
def func():
    (l, r, a) = map(int, input().split())
    if l < r:
        l += min(a, r - l)
        a -= min(a, r - l)
    elif r < l:
        r += min(a, l - r)
        a -= min(a, l - r)
    max_team_size = l + r + a // 2 * 2
    if max_team_size % 2 != 0:
        max_team_size -= 1
    print(max_team_size)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes three non-negative integer values `l`, `r`, and `a` (where \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\)) obtained from user input. It first adjusts the values of `l` and `r` based on their relative sizes and the value of `a`. Specifically, if `l < r`, then `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `r - l`. If `r < l`, then `r` is adjusted to `r + min(a, l - r)`, and `a` is updated accordingly. In both cases, `a` is reduced by the minimum amount used for adjustment.

After adjusting `l` and `r`, the function calculates the maximum possible team size (`max_team_size`) as `l + r + a // 2 * 2`. If this calculated value is odd, `max_team_size` is decremented by 1 to ensure it is even. Finally, the function prints the computed `max_team_size`.

Potential edge cases include when `a` is zero or when `l` equals `r`. If `a` is zero, the adjustments to `l` and `r` will not occur, and the final `max_team_size` will simply be the sum of `l`, `r`, and any remaining `a` (which will be zero). When `l` equals `r`, the adjustments will be made based on the value of `a`, and the final `max_team_size` will be adjusted accordingly.
