Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the total number of players available (left-handers, right-handers, and ambidexters) cannot form an even-sized team with equal numbers of players using their left and right hands. 

For example, consider the input `1 0 0`. According to the problem description, since there is 1 left-hander and no right-handers or ambidexters, it is impossible to form a team of even size where the number of players using their left and right hands is equal. However, the program calculates the maximum team size as `1 + 0 + 0 // 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect because the output should be `0` since no valid team can be formed.
