### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `a` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Balancing Left-Handers and Right-Handers**:
   - If there are more right-handers than left-handers (`r > l`), it attempts to balance by taking the minimum of `a` and `r - l` ambidexters to play with their left hand.
   - Similarly, if there are more left-handers than right-handers (`l > r`), it balances by taking the minimum of `a` and `l - r` ambidexters to play with their right hand.

3. **Calculating Maximum Team Size**:
   - After balancing, the program calculates the maximum team size as the sum of `l`, `r`, and `a // 2 * 2`. This accounts for the fact that each ambidexter can contribute to either side, but we need to ensure the team size is even.
   - If the calculated team size is odd, it subtracts 1 to make it even.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final team size, which is the maximum even number of players that can be formed with the given constraints.

Given these points, the logic appears to handle the constraints correctly and produce the expected results as per the problem statement. 

### Correctness:

**True**
