Initial State: `l`, `r`, and `a` are integers obtained from the input split method. `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The current value of `r` is less than `l`.

Code Block:
```
r += min(a, l - r)
a -= min(a, l - r)
```

Analysis:
1. The first line `r += min(a, l - r)` adds the minimum value between `a` and `l - r` to `r`.
2. The second line `a -= min(a, l - r)` subtracts the same minimum value from `a`.

Let's denote the initial values of `l`, `r`, and `a` as follows:
- `l = L`
- `r = R` (where `R < L`)
- `a = A`

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. Calculate `min(A, L - R)`. This is the smaller value between `A` and `L - R`.
2. Add this minimum value to `R` and subtract it from `A`.

Since `R < L`, the value of `L - R` is positive. Let's denote `min(A, L - R)` as `M`.

- After the first line: `r = R + M`
- After the second line: `a = A - M`

Since `M` is the minimum of `A` and `L - R`, `M` will be the smallest value between `A` and `L - R`.

### Final Output State:
Given the initial conditions and the operations performed, we can express the final state as follows:
- `r` is increased by `M` (the minimum of `A` and `L - R`).
- `a` is decreased by `M` (the same minimum value).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is L, `r` is R + M, `a` is A - M** where `M = min(A, L - R)`.
