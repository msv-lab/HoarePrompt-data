The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, the function likely operates internally with parameters `l`, `r`, and `a`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\). 

Given the lack of explicit parameter definitions in the function signature, we can infer the following:

- The function does not take any parameters explicitly passed to it.
- Internally, it uses `l`, `r`, and `a` as its working variables.

Since the problem does not specify the exact behavior or return value of the function, we can only describe the constraints of the internal parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts no directly passed parameters but uses internally defined non-negative integers `l`, `r`, and `a` where \(0 \leq l, r, a \leq 100\).**
