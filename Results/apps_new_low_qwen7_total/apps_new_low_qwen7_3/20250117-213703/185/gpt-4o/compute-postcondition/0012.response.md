The code `print(max_team_size)` simply prints the value of `max_team_size` which is calculated as `l + r + a`. It does not change any variables. Given that `max_team_size` is `l + r + a`, the only thing that changes is that this value is printed. The variables `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `max_team_size` is `l + r + a` and it is printed.**
