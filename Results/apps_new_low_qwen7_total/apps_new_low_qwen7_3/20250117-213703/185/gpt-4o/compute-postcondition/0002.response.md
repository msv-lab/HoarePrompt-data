Initial State: `l`, `r`, and `a` are integers obtained from the input split method, with `l` being less than `r`.

Code Snippet:
```
l += min(a, r - l)
a -= min(a, r - l)
```

Let's break down the code:

1. `l += min(a, r - l)`:
   - This line adds the minimum value between `a` and `r - l` to `l`.
   - There are two cases to consider:
     - If `a` is less than or equal to `r - l`, then `min(a, r - l) = a`, so `l` increases by `a`.
     - If `a` is greater than `r - l`, then `min(a, r - l) = r - l`, so `l` increases by `r - l`.

2. `a -= min(a, r - l)`:
   - This line subtracts the same minimum value from `a`.
   - In both cases:
     - If `a` is reduced by `a`, then `a` becomes 0.
     - If `a` is reduced by `r - l`, then `a` becomes `a - (r - l)`.

Since `l` is always less than `r`, the second case (where `a` is reduced by `r - l`) can only occur once, when `a >= r - l`. After this subtraction, `a` will either be 0 or a negative number, but since we start with positive integers, it will be 0.

Let's summarize the effects:
- `l` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `r - l`.
- `a` is decreased by the same minimum value, resulting in `a` becoming 0.

Final Output State: **l is increased by the minimum of a and r-l, a is 0**
