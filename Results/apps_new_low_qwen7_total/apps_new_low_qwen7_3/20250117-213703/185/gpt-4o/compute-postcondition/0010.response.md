`max_team_size` is decremented by 1. Since `max_team_size` was initially odd, subtracting 1 from an odd number results in an even number. The values of `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the original value of `l`, `r` is the original value of `r`, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `max_team_size` is an even number.**
